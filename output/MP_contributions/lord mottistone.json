["<cs> my lords i wish at the outset to thank the noble lord lord melchett for introducing this motion and i am sure the house will agree with me when i hope that this means we shall see more of him now he is freed from the burdens of northern ireland <e> <s> i also congratulate my noble friend lord trenchard on his appointment not that i have not already done so and his colleagues on the front bench <e> <s> i congratulate him on some points he made in his speech in which he said that already although he has barely been in his job <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be of assistance to the lord chairman of committees if i told him that in the isle of wight we should be perfectly happy to have three days period of notice <e> <s> i should perhaps add that we share our police force with hampshire so that additional policemen have to be brought over by boat which does not run all the time and not so much at night <e> <s> so we do require this extra warning and anything less than three days would make it difficult for the hampshire police and their administration <e>", "<cs> i wondered whether the noble lords final despatch was a very long one my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the noble <e>", "<cs> i exaggerated my lords forgive me <e> <s> coupled with that thought is the fact and this has been mentioned by various speakers that big companies whatever happens are unlikely to employ more people because as they improve their efficiency in the hopes that they will respond to the initiative taken by the government on the whole they will reduce employment rather than increase it <e> <s> that is certainly my knowledge from my association with industry and i think it is the same for most of us <e> <s> there is also the fact which we cannot baulk that a great number of the conventional industries which used to employ many people are dying on their feet shipbuilding comes immediately to mind <e> <s> therefore in another sense we cannot look as perhaps we used to be able to look to the big companies to solve the problem of employment and give them the chance to build more ships or whatever or order more battleships and i deliberately say battleships because during that era this was a cry that meant something <e> <s> that has all passed too <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene i also have close relations who have been unemployed for very much longer <e> <s> there was a time when what the noble lord was saying was right but i do not believe that in these days noble lords opposite have a monopoly of understanding of the situation unless they are in the older age bracket <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me because my intervention is excessive but did the noble lord address the kind of very fierce remarks which he has addressed to my noble friend to his colleagues during the last four years <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to welcome this bill <e> <s> it seems to me to be wholly sensible to concentrate <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord to tell him that the reason why we on this side are looking rather fazed is that he has already taken twice as long as even very long speeches normally take and i was wondering whether it was really necessary for him to take quite so long to say not very much <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton might recall the phrase brevity is the best feature in the art of public speaking <e>", "<cs> this i assure my noble friends on the front bench is raised in clarification <e> <s> it seems to me that with the new definitions it is not entirely clear from the bill what is the position of wholly-owned subsidiaries of large companies and of companies limited by guarantee without share capital <e> <s> it seemed to me on reading the bill that these would be private companies that they would retain the sub-title limited as in the past and in fact that in respect to their name there would be no change for them <e> <s> i should be grateful if my noble friend could confirm this to me <e>", "<cs> my noble friend mentioned overseas wholly-owned subsidiaries i was inquiring about the wholly-owned subsidiaries of the united kingdom public limited companies <e> <s> what is their status <e>", "<cs> with the greatest possible respect to my noble friend i think he was briefed to answer a question which had a different point from mine <e> <s> of course i do not want to destroy the important parts of the bill it would be absolute nonsense particularly with the eec directive behind it and the particular bits that i sought to amend were identical to the ones in the earlier labour bill <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that i am fearful that the government are making a nonsense by repealing a section of an act and quoting it that is all <e> <s> if my noble friend can assure me that his advisers will look at this and that if necessary the government will come forward with an amendment at report stage i would be more than happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly not prolong this any further and i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope your lordships will forgive me for being repeatedly on my feet during this part of the bill <e> <s> we feel that clause is a rather complicated clause which makes it somewhat difficult for the uninitiated to see precisely what is intended <e> <s> as we see it there are three courses of action open to an old public company and if it does not follow one of them it is committing a criminal offence and because it is committing a criminal offence we think that if it is at all possible it would be extremely helpful if the government could either at a later stage re-word clause so as to make it clear that there are these three possible alternatives one of which must be followed or if that is not possible because of drafting needs perhaps they could make sure and assure your lordships that they are going to produce guidance notes to make it quite clear to people what these options are and how they must take them <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lady hornsby-smith <e> <s> it seems to me that this whole argument has been thought up with great skill and care by the noble lord lord wedderburn in order to fight a battle for which it is not relevant <e> <s> to equate the shareholders of a public company with the members of a trade union strikes me as being a bit of nonsense for the reason already put by my noble friend lord trenchard and others that a shareholder has much greater freedom of action <e> <s> he can sell his shares <e> <s> he can buy shares in other companies <e> <s> but if he is an employee in certain fields of employment he has to belong to a trade union <e> <s> there is a much greater freedom to dispose of your interests and the way in which you can control if you like the company <e>", "<cs> that was a remarkable speech from the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton in suggesting that the government have been getting stranger and stranger <e> <s> in fact they have been consistent <e> <s> it is the opposition who are getting stranger and stranger <e> <s> it seems they are terribly disappointed that parts iv and v of their bills have been cut out and although they have had promises that they will be considered in due course and put into the next bill they appear rather petulant and say they must have the argument now <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may intervene <e> <s> as i understood the noble lord lord mishcon when he introduced amendment no <e>", "<cs> i was wishing to make a point on procedure if i may <e> <s> when the noble lord lord mishcon introduced amendment no <e> <s> he asked us to take with it with the leave of the committee everything except amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> my understanding is that when he says that it means that if he loses on the first amendment the rest automatically fall <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble viscount lord hanworth will agree that achilles was in fact a very successful general <e> <s> perhaps his decision or delayed decision was just the right thing to do <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend to speak a little more slowly <e> <s> he is going so fast that i cannot pick up what i am sure is very important <e> <s> would my noble friend mind going back a bit <e>", "<cs> that is really splendid <e> <s> i rather thought that my noble friend had said that earlier <e>", "<cs> i should like to give him just one example because i do not want to detain the house but suppose you have ordered in shall we say <e> <s> august next year a tin in which to sell biscuits the following christmas and it has not got your old name on it because this bill has been held up by the opposition until christmas-time so you have had your six months and you have made your tin in june <e> <s> you then find that you do not sell them all at christmas but that you can sell them at christmas <e> <s> that might be two years after the bill had been passed <e> <s> that is an example of what <e>", "<cs> the words are any document or object in line <e> <s> it is the or object that is bugging us <e> <s> perhaps the government will take that or board <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope my noble friend lord lauderdale will forgive me if i say that i think that this clause is unnecessary <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that things have been happening very fast in industry during these last two or three months <e> <s> i have a lot of contact with several companies and it is quite remarkable how they have reacted to the fact that their fuel costs have gone up by something of the order of per cent <e> <s> the fact is that the hard economics of life are being a much more effective disciplining weapon if you like to persuade people to take the very measures that my noble friend so rightly says should be taken and it is happening so fast that unless you are quite closely in contact which i have to be you are not aware of precisely what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house no i am afraid i cannot tell your lordships <e> <s> no do not laugh <e> <s> i cannot tell the house publicly the names of the companies because i know them confidentially but i am very prepared to tell the noble lord lord lloyd at any time privately and on his promise not to disclose these names exactly what i am talking about <e> <s> i can tell your lordships that of the companies with which i am closely in touch i know for a fact that per cent <e> <s> of them are talking very active measures and another per cent <e> <s> are starting to do so <e> <s> i cannot go further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to leave out clause <e> <s> the object of this amendment is one of purely probing the government <e> <s> your lordships may remember that at committee stage i had amendments down to what was then clause which has now become clause to be nore specific to subsection of that clause to the effect that the six months period that public companies will be allowed to change their name wherever that occurs whether on stationery packaging vans or on the facias of banks really was not enough <e> <s> your lordships will remember that the noble lord lord lyell at the committee stage in column of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for the statement which goes as far as we could have hoped for in our happiest moments <e> <s> i can speak also on behalf of my noble friend lord redmayne who most unfortunately had another appointment at this time and has asked me to apologise to your lordships for his absence <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope not to detain your lordships for long <e> <s> my noble friend lord inglewood whom i thank for having put down this unstarred question asked me to say a word or two about the service aspect <e> <s> if it is not out of order it would have been very much better if black rod could have taken part in the debate for not only did he leave the services more recently than i but he is a general officer of dis <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is in line with what i am saying if the detail is slightly off track <e> <s> it is necessary to have this acceptance of the importance of an inspection system <e> <s> that is the main point <e> <s> i do not think there is a great deal to be said for having a united kingdom-wide inspectorate <e> <s> my thinking would be that it would be better to keep it more regionalised because of the differences that relate throughout the country <e> <s> that is probably enough said about that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is the point <e> <s> in the navy one is reported on every six months and i think probably in a more static force once a year would do <e> <s> it is not keyed to the inspection of one ship or unit because of course time does not necessarily permit that <e> <s> the reports on people are at stated intervals and the convenience of having a senior officers inspection may not fit with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for his reply may i ask whether the government are still confident that the united states have the capability for monitoring any testing and so on which the soviet union may conduct in the future in view of certain happenings in relation to their land-based monitoring capability <e>", "<cs> my lords it really is a most interesting opportunity to follow the noble lord lords brooks of tremorfa which i have not had the privilege of doing before because it seems to me that he absolutely epitomises in his own speeches and so do other noble lords opposite the difficulties that my noble friend lord thorneycroft asked us to look at <e> <s> the difficulties are that noble lords opposite and their supporters outside this place do not seem to be able to learn from past experience do not seem to be able to realise that the way in which they attempted to run this country when they provided the government during the last years has not worked <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e> <s> every time they have tried with the very best of intentions <e> <s> i shall always credit them with good intentions and i shall not add any other points to that <e> <s> but the fact is that it is extremely difficult to run everything if you do not have the resources <e>", "<cs> but the most important difficulty that we have as a country forgetting the government is the fact that the message of the past that has been drummed home to us by fact also if you like by the imf and by other kinds of bodies has not been hoisted in by noble lords opposite <e> <s> that is the difficulty <e> <s> the opportunity is there if only we can get latched on to the need for this country for every country for that matter to give a free rein to freedom and enterprise <e> <s> that is the key to success <e> <s> if we endeavour so far as is possible to give individuals throughout the country freedom to get on freedom to develop and freedom to use their bright ideas and the opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer the noble lord lord kaldor <e> <s> if i may say so he is making another speech rather than asking me a question <e> <s> i can certainly answer his question <e> <s> i am looking forwards not backwards i am not looking to put this country back to the th century <e> <s> i am looking forward to an environment in which we can develop forwards <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the experiments we have made and i have supported many of them in order to try to sort out our problems during the last years have not all worked <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by joining other noble lords in thanking very much the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for introducing this important subject at a timely moment <e> <s> i should also like to join the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson in saying how much i support the principle that commissioners who spend hours and days on these sorts of tasks need to receive every consideration and to be spared false comment from people who have not had time to read their reports <e>", "<cs> my lords it is i am sure a great debt that we owe to the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> i am extremely sorry that he has been promoted to the front bench <e> <s> it used to be my pleasure to joust with him at the bottom end of the list of speakers like now before he was so elevated <e> <s> i regret to say that my late arrival meant that i missed not only his speech but also that of two of the maiden speakers the noble lord lord ross and my noble friend lord godber of willington for which i deeply apologise <e> <s> but i was privileged to arrive in the middle of the speech of the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos which i thought was a remarkably moderate speech <e> <s> it is almost presumptious to comment upon it with his great parliamentary experience but i think that he was skilful in putting across a very contentious view without apparently being contentious <e> <s> i am sure we shall all benefit from hearing him in the future <e>", "<cs> i would not have thought so my lords not since <e> <s> but still taking inflation the rpi has risen by per cent <e> <s> in the last five years and the inflation rate has been rising in the recent past since october <e> <s> to take another factor an objective perhaps that one might look at let us consider living standards <e> <s> overall during the past five years the net income of the average family man remained stagnant <e> <s> finally perhaps we might look at unemployment which at million in april this year was more than twice as high as in february and the unemployment figure for each month since august has been over a million <e> <s> so much for the objectives and how they have been achieved during the past five years <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord suggesting that the investment should all be done by the government or that they should encourage private industry to do their own investment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that perhaps government investment on the whole has not been very successful <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank very much my noble friend if i may so describe him in these circumstances of the eec scrutiny committee lord sainsbury for introducing this motion and also for the skill and wisdom with which he chaired the subcommittee which examined this problem on behalf of the select committee <e> <s> it seemed to me that in the first instance this particular directive must have been introduced because there was a need for it on the continent of europe <e> <s> sometimes particularly in relation to consumer affairs in this country we tend to forget that we have a common border in ireland with other community members and we tend perhaps not to see quite as clearly as those which have their countries adjacent to one another the fact that they are sharing all sorts of services like shops <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to thank very much those who have taken part <e> <s> as i had hoped their contributions were complementary wide-ranging and covered the subject as fully as they could in a short afternoon <e> <s> i thank my noble friend lord gowrie for his reply and for undertaking to look at some of the points i made to him <e> <s> it is perhaps unfortunate that he is still leaving the manpower services commission in the position of examining its own affairs which is slightly unfair for it and perhaps he would give another thought to that <e> <s> on other points i should be grateful if at some time he would let me know which ones he would particularly like not to do so enabling me to know which to plug the hardest <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great sympathy with the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> i would not say that i entirely agree with him all the way down the line and i particularly do not agree about the freedom issue <e> <s> i do not think this has anything to do with freedom <e> <s> you might just as well say that we ought to be free to drink as much as we like or to go as fast as we like on the roads <e> <s> society does make a certain number of rules to protect itself from itself and i would have thought that this came more in that area <e> <s> where i have sympathy however is in this respect that it always sticks in my gullet when i hear a radio announcer talking about the in a rugger match instead of the <e> <s> i think it is a great pity that the frenchmen who in their wisdom devised the metric system in the th centry did not get is quite right and therefore the nautical mile of yards is more closely connected with the degree of latitiude than is the kilometer <e> <s> it would have been a very good thing if the frenchmen had been more advanced and had got the thing more accurate so that that little error did not exist for all time <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for only just getting here in time to address your lordships <e> <s> i shall not keep the house long <e> <s> i have just one point to make in relation to the bill <e> <s> first may i thank the government for the very understanding way in which they have listened to representations while the bill has gone through another place in relation to one particular point namely the need for an opportunity to be given to those companies which are being investigated at various levels of the bill whether by the director general of fair trading or by the monopolies and mergers commission to see the reports before they are made public <e> <s> i think that this point has been taken care of in a very satisfactory way by an amendment that was made in another place just before the bill left it so far as the monopolies and mergers commission is concerned and so far as reports which are laid before parliament are concerned <e>", "<cs> i understand what my noble friend has said and it is significant perhaps that he did not think of the example i gave because it may be that we were working slightly at cross-purposes <e> <s> i hope that what i have said and i shall certainly study with great care <e>", "<cs> i have a copy of the document and it says <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble lord lord jacques before finally reaching a conclusion has given consideration to subsection <e> <s> he has come a long way towards modification of his original point <e> <s> the subsection seems to make provision for the negative aspect of what lord jacques is calling for positively <e> <s> it may be that the negative aspect of this matter meets the point of my noble friend it must it is in the bill in the sense that it is not calling for a vast comprehensive list but is going somewhere towards identifying those areas where specific acts are not treated as anticompetitive <e> <s> that goes a long way towards meeting the basic principle asked for by the noble lord lord jacques <e>", "<cs> i do hope that if the government think further about this they will bear in mind that co-operative farmers are no different from other traders and that they need to be in competition with other processors and traders of whatever sort and therefore need to be subject to anti-competitive legislation as much as anybody else <e> <s> i hope that will be fully borne in mind by the government <e>", "<cs> there is one small point which worries me <e> <s> the noble baroness said that because the matter is going to be made public anyhow then there is purpose for her amendment because it gives a chance to the company to explain the situation beforehand <e> <s> what i did not like was her point nor did i like the fact that my noble friend on the front bench did not refute that point because as i read clause <e>", "<cs> i quite take the point made by my noble friend that it is necessary to have this provision in paragraph <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend very much for that further answer which i shall study with great <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support my noble friend in her amendment <e> <s> in any case i had it in mind at some suitable stage to ask the government why it is that there is no reference to public interest in relation to the sort of inquiry which is the subject of this clause <e> <s> clause refers to section of the fair trading act which is all about public interest <e> <s> i find it odd that the public interest aspect of an investigation is not mentioned at all in this clause or indeed in the succeeding one <e> <s> i have it in mind to put down an amendment at a later stage in order to invite the government to comment on this more fully it would be a very good opportunity for them to do so <e> <s> in the meantime may i suggest to the government that it would be reasonable to accept my noble friends amendment <e> <s> if on reflection they do not much like it they can always take it out at a later stage <e>", "<cs> it seems that i am not getting any further support on this particular point <e> <s> i am heartened by various things that my noble friend said <e> <s> i was rather distracted by the noble baroness and she has rather upset my thoughts which were carefully assembled for the task <e> <s> i think that the reassurances are as satisfactory as one can hope for <e> <s> would the government and this is a practice which has been adopted in other circumstances give consideration to making it possible for these reports the noble lord talked about reports so presumably there might be several of them to be generalised so as to get the point across and made anonymous so that the specific company which had been investigated is not mentioned by name <e> <s> i think that would help <e> <s> therefore every six months one would get a report from the director which would say during the past six months i have investigated <e>", "<cs> i was going to speak in support of my noble friend lady hornsby-smith on her amendment but i understand that she has embodied it within this one <e> <s> i support her amend <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i happily withdraw this amendment and look forward to seeing the government amendment at report stage <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his very clear reply which has clarified the situation well <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i regret the note on which my noble friend lord trefgarne ended both his first reply to me and also to my noble friend with all this business about judgments and vetoes and so on <e> <s> the earlier part of his statement was most acceptable and understanding and i hope that it actually happens <e> <s> one is always slightly worried and this applies to both sides of the house about allowing things not to be put into an act of parliament and relying on the goodwill of public bodies which in <e>", "<cs> i am not quite clear if the noble lord said he would if i pressed him look at it again but is not going to agree <e> <s> that seems rather pointless <e> <s> is he going to look at it again or not <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry to keep this going <e> <s> i have said that i quite accept as one always does when one produces amendments that the wording is not quite right <e> <s> it is the general overall sense of this amendment that one wishes to have reconsidered at the highest level perhaps i might ask <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend very much for being so concessionary in the end and with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the closing remarks of my noble friend on the front bench mean that whatever is done under clause it will be quite certain that the activities of these co-operatives are fully treated in a similar anti-competitive fashion to the activities of any other trader with whom they may be in competition <e> <s> i would be grateful if my noble friend could reassure me on that particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment even if talking from these benches <e> <s> it seems to me that it is important <e> <s> it comes back to the fundamentals we went into in committee and i am not going to repeat it all now <e> <s> it is important on this initial stage of an investigation when undertaken in this connection that the maximum protection should be given to the people who are the targets of the investigation to cover them in the event that the investigation turns out to be unnecessary to cover them in the event that they give an undertaking or perhaps several undertakings to make sure that they themselves are protected as much as possible because they are going to get publicity <e> <s> that i fear we have to accept and the debates we had at committee stage rather made this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> the object of the amendment is to cover a situation where there is agreement <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords that is extremely generous and with that undertaking i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel i must now speak and apologise very deeply both to the house and to the noble lord lord jacques for the mistake that i made in misquoting him as my opponent in the debate on th july which is fully reported in cols <e> <s> to <e> <s> the noble lord with whom i was jousting was in fact the noble lord lord oram and i hope noble lords will forgive me because on those occasions in and particularly the two noble lords were frequently representing the government on the front bench and taking bills alternately and one never quite knew who was dealing with which <e> <s> my memory let me down and i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend on the front bench for having put down this amendment in response to his undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords i should love to hear from one of my farming friends just why they deserve to he singled out to be excluded from this act which is to apply to practically every other trading business in the country <e> <s> what is so special about the farmers <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i could finish my sentence <e> <s> what is so special about the farmers that makes them justifiably excluded from this act and nobody else <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend whether that is a speech or an interruption in my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house may i say that i was rather swept off my feet by my noble friend <e> <s> it seems to me that if we have a body which is in a semi-monopolist position it is only reasonable that as well as being subject to the rest of the act it should be subject to clause and i cannot see why the farmers need special treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend very much for that answer and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very much to thank my noble friend if i may so describe him lord clifford of chudleigh for introducing this most timely and interesting debate <e> <s> i must apologise to my noble friend lord belstead and to my noble friend lord murton of lindisfarne for missing their speeches <e> <s> indeed i must apologise to your lordships for not having been here at the opening of the debate <e> <s> i hope however that i can make some fairly short contribution to the debate as the hour is late <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we ought to look at this from a rather broader position than just from the point of view of the milk marketing board <e> <s> it seems to me that there are a great many other public bodies covered by clause of the bill to which the same arguments could very well apply <e> <s> i find it difficult to see why the milk marketing board should particularly seek the custody and safe treatment of their own minister when for instance other public boards that are in competition with other sources as for instance the railways who arc in competition with other forms of transport have not sought to have their minister covered in this respect <e>", "<cs> yes my lords indeed but there are other sponsoring ministeries who deal with other people and it seems to me that what is being lost sight of and this is the important point is that the milk marketing board are in competition with other traders and it seems unreasonable under the headingcompetition in a competition bill <e> <s> that one particular group of traders to wit the milk marketing board should have any preferential treatment if it is preferential treatment in being able to involve their own sponsoring ministry <e> <s> you can say that it is not preferential treatment in which case what is the point of the amendment <e> <s> therefore my lords i wonder whether this amendment and the following ones are really necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we may come back to the general picture rather than to the pure farming picture <e> <s> the main point relates to fairness to all <e> <s> we are in the competition business <e> <s> as the milk marketing board is a trader it competes with other traders <e> <s> we are asking for the same system for all <e> <s> i shall not redeploy my other argument <e> <s> all i shall say is that i am sad that the government shot my fox on the last occasion and at the end of the hunting season too <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only briefly because i have said it before <e> <s> what we want is equal treatment for all <e> <s> why should there by anything special for the farmers <e> <s> the act is years old <e> <s> maybe it is a bit old <e> <s> that seems to me to he the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all those companies who were investigated by the price commission will be very pleased to have heard what my noble friend had to say about the very rigorous security that will be applied to the records of the price commission <e> <s> i note also and with pleasure that any reason for changing that arrangement will be relayed to the cbi at the appropriate stage <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i ask whether he is aware that having attended the debate for his speech and that of the noble lord lord milne i have only just regained a reasonable temperature after having walked for a quarter of an hour in order to come down to the house <e> <s> it has taken me all that time to get properly heated up <e>", "<cs> my lords i noted when my noble friend was speaking that she indicated that support for mature students who were employed by local government was available but she did not mention anyone else <e> <s> i speak on behalf of the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children which being a charity has great difficulty in getting expert extra knowledge for its representatives in the field who are all of the older generation many are ex-servicemen as my noble friend lady faithfull has suggested <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will seek to convey to her colleagues in the dhss <e>", "<cs> my lords surely when the prosperity returns to the country when there is no chance of the noble lords opposite ever being in power again we shall get to a state where there are fewer people on supplementary benefit or receiving family income supplement because the two must go together <e> <s> the prosperity of the country is entirely centred upon people being in employment and receiving a full and decent wage so that they can pay for their own childrens food <e> <s> surely therefore the entire purpose of this amendment is misconceived because it is based on a theory which assumes that there will be no prosperity whereas if there is prosperity it is not needed <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way <e>", "<cs> i think it is going rather far <e>", "<cs> my lords before we go any further and having waited a long time i wish to thank the government very much for these amendments which they kindly promised when this bill was before this house and put into the bill in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking the noble lord lord walston very much for putting down this debate and as other speakers have said for chairing our committee so ably not forgetting to thank also lord cledwyn of penrhos for his excellent chairmanship at its time <e> <s> i should like also to add to the remarks of the noble lord lord walston in thanking the technical adviser and the clerk to the committee <e> <s> i think that their work particularly under a certain amount of pressure from certain members of the committee who were keen to have alterations made at short notice and the way they tackled it all and the fact that we were able finally to get little red books on time for everyone to look at strikes me as a masterly achievement for which we shall be eternally grateful <e>", "<cs> i greatly respect the words of lord taylor of gryfe who is much more knowledgeable in these matters than i am but that is not the problem <e> <s> is not the problem that when there is underpinning from the state <e>", "<cs> i am sure they are splendid people in every way and exactly as the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe says <e> <s> it is the effect on people of the sort of legislation which is being modified in this bill which is what matters rather than the day-to-day competence of the people trying to administer the previous laws <e> <s> i am not quarrelling with that but with the underlying thought <e> <s> this bill is trying to modify that <e> <s> it is not going to wipe it away but to modify it so that people stand on their own feet <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the first three speakers for having been late in joining the debate and particularly to my noble friend lord strathcona but i have heard most of the debate <e> <s> i shall be concentrating on the navy mainly because one must narrow the area covered in this vast subject <e> <s> i think it is a pity that we have to do that because there are so many things that are better dealt with covering all the services rather than one specifically <e> <s> but it provides perhaps a better balance to the debate <e> <s> in that connection i hope that the government will give a second thought to the wise proposal by my noble friend lord cathcart which has been mentioned by other noble lords that the defence problem should be debated much more thoroughly by having short debates to deal with specific subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene is the noble lord aware that the number of extra women in employment over the last seven years equals almost exactly the number of unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord hatch of lusby because it is so interesting to me that here we have what the secretary of state during this last weekend described as a human relations bill and one of the problems about human relations is that we all see each other differently <e> <s> we find that we know lots of trade union officials both junior and senior we know noble lords opposite we know tough and easy-going managers and employers <e> <s> we know the lot <e> <s> you know them and i know them <e> <s> on the whole they are pleasant earnest and full of good will but they are practically always misguided and a classical example is noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> maybe my lords <e>", "<cs> perhaps my lords but on the other hand it also takes away rights from superior bodies which are in a position to oppress individuals <e> <s> it is therefore a matter of balance and that goes all the way through <e> <s> i said this was a human relations bill <e> <s> human relations involve many facets <e> <s> they involve guarding freedom for individuals <e> <s> directly one uses the word freedom one is asked freedom for whom <e> <s> is it freedom for the trade union member for the company employer for the trade union official for the company manager or is it freedom for people who are not involved at all people outside the company in the street the ordinary person <e> <s> the answer is that it is freedom for all and we have to get the balance right <e>", "<cs> surely the answer to the question of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> although i understand completely what the noble lord lord mccarthy has said and that there are bodies such as clubs to which people have their own rules for entry there is one essential difference between a trade union and a club <e> <s> if one does not belong to a club one does not lose the opportunity to earn ones living whereas under certain circumstances with which this clause deals it is possible to lose the opportunity to earn ones living if one does not belong to an appropriate trade union <e>", "<cs> i do not quite understand the pressure from the noble lord lord mccarthy for the small firm to be subject to the procedures of this clause <e> <s> it is rather as though he was trying to force them to the tribunals when they did not need to go there <e> <s> it also seems to me that he was twitting my noble friend lord gowrie for not producing statistics to back up his case although my noble friend as we now know has them before him and i suspect that he does not have any statistics to prove that small firms as he ended his speech particularly need the treatment of his amendment <e> <s> that is what he rather indicated <e>", "<cs> i would question that <e> <s> i do not know how well the noble lord knows small firms but i have a great deal to do with many of them and on the whole they have better labour relations they must have than many larger and even medium-sized firms <e> <s> if they do not work they are not successful they cannot make a success of their business if those concerned are not at least reasonably able to get on together <e> <s> therefore we are talking about the exceptions we are not talking about the normal run of small businesses <e>", "<cs> very briefly it seems to me that we are not finding it easy to follow this argument because the government quite rightly have only quoted from subsection of clause of the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy phrased his case very delicately and tried plausibly to impress us <e> <s> he spoke about widening slightly and then widening somewhat which was getting nearer the case <e> <s> i would say that he is driving a great big hole through the entire clause and that is obviously his intention <e> <s> in fact he is endeavouring to turn upside down its entire purpose and i believe that we need to read his speech in that light <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord lord wedderburn not agree that the reason a clause on these lines has to be considered is as my noble and learned friend said in relation to the earlier amendment due to the most unsavoury and unpleasant actions of slade <e> <s> had they not done that we might not have found ourselves in the position of having to seek a way to curb that sort of thing in the future <e> <s> as i understand it although i am no expert in this line the government have done their best notwithstanding the measures they have taken to prevent what i think is universally agreed as an unsuitable and unsavoury practice on the part of a trade union like slade still to give the maximum what one might call traditional freedom to trade unions which behave in a proper sort of way <e> <s> it would seem to me that this amendment is going to sweep away the corrective action and that therefore it should not be supported <e>", "<cs> if i may speak to amendment no <e> <s> hha and depart from what the noble baroness has been saying may i mention in passing that the main theme of my amendment follows more closely section of the act referred to by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> indeed it follows it more closely than lord mccarthys own amendment which is really a reprint of the relevant parts of section as it was before which included various points which are not relevant to the main purpose which i wish to pursue <e>", "<cs> may i just set the mind of my noble friend at rest <e> <s> there is nothing in my amendment which would perpetuate the sort of thing she was talking about and which i entirely agree with her should not be perpetuated <e>", "<cs> i do not think that an understanding of what joint industrial councils negotiate is reflected in what my noble friend has just been saying <e> <s> there is nothing compulsory affecting all employers <e> <s> all that is established are minimum earnings levels and minimum terms and conditions <e> <s> all the big companies whose views are no doubt reflected in what my noble friend is saying pay well above that and have at least the same if not better terms and conditions <e>", "<cs> when i retired from the navy at the age of i was unemployed for six weeks and drew unemployment benefit primarily to find out what it was like to do so and i discovered that they paid it from a different office from social security benefits and that of course was a valuable thing to have learned <e> <s> do i understand that under the bill i would not now be able to do that and gain the valuable experience that i did on that occasion <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down could he tell us why in view of the letter he read out at the end of his speech he did not put an amendment down to give effect to that letter instead of the amendment he has put down <e>", "<cs> that is not a very good explanation <e> <s> it would have been better to concentrate on an amendment for which the noble lord had a definite statement rather than making a general one and taking a particular issue <e> <s> to take the noble lord very quickly up on this point about the right to strike of course it is entirely agreed from this side of the committee that there must be a right to strike <e> <s> of course at the time the strike occurs the people who are striking believe in their cause but it seems surely <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord aware that not once in his last remarks has he mentioned the responsibility of the individual towards his own family <e> <s> he has been talking about the responsibilities of great amorphous masses of trade unions and governments but he has not taken into account the very important thing the last resort indeed to some people the first resort the responsibility of the individual towards his own family and the responsibility for his actions in and the effect that they may have on his own family <e>", "<cs> i have been doing so <e>", "<cs> i am talking about actions not money <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to begin by extending my warmest congratulations to my noble friend the leader of the house and to lady soames as well <e> <s> i must apologise to your lordships for not having been here for the opening speeches because of another appointment <e> <s> i am extremely sorry if as a result i cover ground which other speakers have already covered <e> <s> for that i beg your lordships forgiveness <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord lord wells-pestell seeking to reinstate the government in the foreground of industrial disputes from which i would suggest to your lordships it is the purpose of this legislation and of other legislation to withdraw them <e> <s> the government surely should not be in the foreground <e> <s> an industrial dispute is between a group of men and their employer supported by their trade union <e> <s> they are undertaking an enterprise if you like to call it that which they decide they need to do for a particular purpose and they should support themselves in principle when they are doing that <e> <s> when things go wrong and hard for individuals within this <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not waste your lordships time <e> <s> it is a straight difference of opinion and i think that noble lords opposite are wrong <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down is it entirely right that bill and george as he described them should be excluded from voting <e> <s> why should bill and george because they have been with the company for years and are not union members be excluded from this voting pattern <e> <s> he put it across very plausibly as he always does and very charmingly as though it was a foregone conclusion but i question whether it is a foregone conclusion <e> <s> i should have thought that bill and george would want to vote and why should they not <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not think that he has postulated a very plausible case but it is all anticipating a situation which may or may not occur in real life <e> <s> it would seem to me that he is jumping ahead to assume that there are various factors built into this bill which will not operate and which will not be successful and the theme of the attitude of mind in industry that is developing over the months will not continue to develop in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not think that the fact <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that all that this is trying to do is to share the cost of some sort of action <e> <s> it is not that anybody is being prevented from doing anything <e> <s> it is that anybody who is responsible for initiating a particular framework is going to have to pay his share instead of it all being carried possibly by a victim company who appear in the sense of a victim because they did not initiate the action which is involved in this amendment <e> <s> i should have thought that the noble lord is rather over-gilding the situation and making more of it than would be reasonable <e> <s> however i will leave it to my noble friend on the front bench to deal with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to speak following the noble lord lord rochester who kindly mentioned my reaction to his statement while he was speaking <e> <s> i was looking forward to the debate on this amendment having missed no <e> <s> to see exactly what noble lords opposite meant <e> <s> the house may remember that in between the two the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor pointed out the importance of plain english <e> <s> it would seem to me that plain english about workers is more important than what appears in some act passed by noble lords opposite in and it is a pity if they sought to define worker in some technical way which distinguishes it from employee <e> <s> i was intrigued although i found it difficult to follow by what the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton was saying about self-employed labour which somehow implied that self-employed labourers were not workers <e> <s> what the government could well do is first to sort out the fact that they have worker in clause which is obviously at loggerheads with what is elsewhere <e>", "<cs> do i understand from my noble friend that if the doctors do not marry these girls their secretaries and so on the government will pay happily <e> <s> in that case the government are not really saving money but encouraging the doctors and their girls to live in sin <e> <s> and they cannot guarantee they will save money because perhaps the doctors may not want to marry their secretaries <e> <s> so if i may say so it is a ridiculous argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i said some time ago that my heart bled <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank my noble friend lady faithfull for moving my amendment today and for putting the case so ably <e> <s> i am sure that i could not have done better but there are two points that i should like to emphasise <e> <s> one is that there is evidence both in the case of overseas people and in the case of people coming from may i say <e> <s> undesirable parts of the country to more desirable parts that this is done deliberately to exploit the housing homeless persons act <e> <s> it seems to me that we must somehow have that act modified <e> <s> i am heartened by the fact that my right honourable friend the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend very much for his statement <e> <s> if i might say so the noble baroness lady birk greatly exaggerated the deleterious effects of this amendment <e> <s> in the first place there is no suggestion that there should he no housing at all for people who come from overseas <e> <s> we are only talking about council housing and there is no reason why there should not be other sorts of housing for people from overseas <e> <s> it is certainly not the intention of this amendment to <e>", "<cs> i am coming on to refugees in a minute my lords <e> <s> i am talking about people who are not refugees and who come here of their own volition <e> <s> as to refugees i noted what my noble friend on the front bench had to say <e> <s> i personally think there is probably a good case for some special refugee facilities organised by the government on a national scale but no doubt the government will take that into account when they study the problem as they say they will <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords opposite have attempted to create the impression that the sort of people who will be buying council houses in scotland are dumb peasants who are likely to be fooled by the local authority <e> <s> as a half-scotsman myself i think that this is a grave insult to my fellow countrymen <e> <s> i think the whole impression created is absolute nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to start by congratulating my noble friend lord grimston of westbury <e> <s> he was absolutely right to choose litter as his subject for being non-controversial upon because we all agree with him <e> <s> however i look forward to the day when he makes a speech which is controversial and i hope that we shall not have to wait too long for it <e>", "<cs> the fact that powers have not been used for years may not mean that they have not been of value for the reasons i advanced it may well be that the fact they are there has made people reach agreement which they otherwise might not have reached <e> <s> however this is not a vital point <e> <s> it is useful to have been reminded by my noble friend that the right of appeal still remains and with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i feel that with the ready acceptance by the government of the principle behind my amendment and the fact that the government have undertaken themselves to put down an amendment which i trust will appeal to my noble friend lord sandford as well with pleasure i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do beg your lordships pardon for having misunderstood the intentions of my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i certainly do not wish to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the technical difficulties that my noble friend the minister has pointed out and i am reassured by the fact that he does not altogether discount the principle of my amendment for reconsideration in the future <e> <s> it seems to me that the prosperity of the country is indirectly affected by the present situation but with that semi-assurance on the part of my noble friend for which i am most grateful i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether my noble and learned friend the lord advocate would care to respond to the suggestion of my noble friends lord harmar-nicholls and lord morris and say whether he would be prepared to consider the matter again <e> <s> he spoke about two threads in my argument he produced two splendid threads in his argument <e> <s> in fact at the beginning of his speech he supported the principle as indeed he did in his closing remarks <e> <s> then he put in this nasty paragraph about bureaucracy which we all know can be argued the other way round if people have the will <e> <s> indeed in my speech i anticipated that there would be a difficulty and said that if there is a will there is a way <e> <s> before i go any further i just wonder whether my noble and learned friend has anything further to say <e>", "<cs> notwithstanding my noble and learned friends remarks now i did detect a chink in his armour in his earlier statement and i think that further study of the <e>", "<cs> it is again am afraid a rather disappointing answer <e> <s> it would seem to me as my noble and <e>", "<cs> i find my noble friends arguments rather more persuasive than those of his colleagues earlier in the evening <e> <s> the point about my amendment is that it would be effective for all time <e> <s> clearly the country will prosper one day as long as this government remain in power <e> <s> we can look forward to an occasion when the last remarks of my noble friend will be relevant to the situation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is very tempting my lords <e> <s> yes i get a certain amount of reassurance from my noble friends remarks <e> <s> could my noble friend possibly say whether the government would be able to reach a conclusion before the bill completes its passage through parliament so that we could bring the matter up at a later stage <e>", "<cs> with that very unsatisfactory closing remark i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> this is an area where not only have we got a new source of food but it is an exciting one for development for all the reasons that noble lords have so eloquently told us about <e>", "<cs> we have been hearing from all sorts of people who seem to hate the new proposals for rate support grant <e> <s> i come from the isle of wight a part of the world where in point of fact the present system is so dreadful that anything that replaces it is bound to be better <e> <s> in we had two-thirds of the grant per head of population of the average for england and wales and we are reasonably confident that the new plans will be an improvement <e>", "<cs> the each in this amendment is in line not line <e>", "<cs> we have exactly the same experience in the isle of wight with a rising population and a falling grant <e> <s> is not that a great argument for moving to a new form of rate support grant <e>", "<cs> of course i am not happy with what my noble friend has said although i was gratified with his closing remarks <e> <s> what i think is such a pity and i made a great point of this at second reading is that the officials in london cannot see that islands are islands primarily and administrative areas secondarily <e> <s> this seems to be beyond their comprehension <e> <s> it is a pity when people are so narrow-minded and unable to see the realities of life when sitting in a cosy little city like london <e> <s> it is a great tragedy that the realities of life escape the government but with that i think there is not much point in beating my head against this brick wall at this moment <e> <s> i shall have to try some other way in which to attack the government at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that his incredibly skilful batting causes great pleasure on these benches <e> <s> is he further aware that <e>", "<cs> if i might make a small point my noble friend lord sandys referred to my noble friend lord ridley as having quoted the standing committee stage <e> <s> i think he will find that it was i who referred to it and perhaps the record should be amended accordingly <e> <s> i have greatly welcomed my noble friends acceptance of the amendment and i commend it to your lordships <e>", "<cs> i was invited by my noble friend lord sandford to consider that my amendment no <e> <s> should be included with these others and i am certainly prepared so to do <e> <s> that amendment is in fact a probing amendment which followed on from a similar one in another place in which the minister undertook to find out from the district councils whether they wished for the sort of power that my amendment would give them <e> <s> it seems to me that the district councils are not entirely of one mind as to whether or not they are ready for that and i personally think that the amendment of my noble friend lord ridley particularly amendment no <e> <s> a is the one which is most deserving of support without amendment to it <e>", "<cs> i would propose to comment on each of the amendments the two that have not been accepted when we come to them as they are called <e>", "<cs> on amendment no <e> <s> i have listened with interest to what my noble friend had to say <e> <s> perhaps i might be able to detect in that something which would give rise to my putting down an amendment at a later stage <e> <s> at this stage i

amend <e>", "<cs> do i understand there is not a separate code of practice that everything that is effective within it is in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to plug this point but i do not believe

included in this <e> <s> is there a special onus on people who live in national parks to develop in accordance with the national parks policy <e> <s> i think it is important that this should be included if possible <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said earlier that he hoped the assurances he had given would be sufficient to satisfy me <e> <s> i really did not notice any assurances <e>", "<cs> i

report of what has been said we may come back at the next stage <e> <s> there is still a point which has not really been taken up by anybody that is the appeals that seem to prove the point which my

that because there are all sorts of areas in which original basic research and basic thinking has come more from this country than from many others <e> <s> it could well be that on looking into this matter rather more thoroughly we should find that the west germans have tended to develop new concepts which other people have tried out first <e> <s> i would not like to pursue that point too far but

briefly to support my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord cathcart on initiating this debate and to apologise to your lordships for having missed the opening speeches owing to a commitment from which i could not escape <e> <s> i get the impression from what i have heard in the later speeches that most of the ground has been covered <e> <s> but there are one or two points which i think it reasonable to put to your lordships and i hope to do so briefly at this latening hour <e> <s> one of the things in recent weeks that has absolutely appalled me is the resurgence of the campaign for nuclear disarmament <e> <s> i do not doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for being so late in the chamber and being slightly out of breath in starting to address your lordships <e> <s> i hope your lordships will forgive me for seeking to involve myself in this debate <e> <s> i find the problem that is before us an extremely difficult one upon which to arrive at a proper decision <e> <s> i would like to thank my noble friend lord alport very much indeed for putting down this motion for starting this bill before parliament <e> <s> on great reflection i feel that there are three particular points of importance to this house and i shall mention them very briefly very much in order of priority <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by thanking the noble lord lord scanlon for introducing this debate with such tremendous enthusiasm and inspiration as to catch the imagination of us all <e> <s> may i also congratulate my noble friend lord boardman upon his <e>", "<cs> my lords i wear seat belts whenever i think it is necessary and quite a lot of the time when i think it is not necessary <e> <s> i would like your lordships to appreciate that to start with <e> <s> however i believe my noble friends bill does not deserve the support of the house because apart from the freedom side of it which my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye epitomises in his amendment it is a bill which if made law could not be fairly enforced and it is the fairness which is important and i have said this to your lordships before in relation to bills of the same sort <e>", "<cs> my lords the point at issue is of course whether the bill or anything like it will seriously reduce the number of road casualties <e> <s> i should very much doubt it <e> <s> various noble lords in particular i think the noble lord lord richardson implied that directly the bill became law the number of road accidents would drop dramatically <e> <s> i do not think that that is the case <e> <s> i do not think many people would pay any attention to such a law until they started getting caught and as for the point that most of them would not get caught i do not think that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall perhaps surprise the noble baroness lady white by saying that i support the regulations <e> <s> i am advised in what i have to say by the confederation of british industry which represents a large interest of industrialists throughout the country <e> <s> as i understand it the proposals for the regulations based as they are on the directive which is referred to in the explanatory note of the regulations have been under consideration in long and involved discussions with all the interested parties for three years embodying the time when the noble baroness lady birk was at the department of the environment <e> <s> therefore matters were obviously being discussed quite well in the early stages if from her point of view they were not in the latter stages <e>", "<cs> perhaps my lords the noble baroness would go along with the thought that that means that there has been a lot of discussion <e> <s> people have actually developed their thinking <e> <s> they have not relied on what was current thinking in <e> <s> i would not really know but that is a possible explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by saying that in preparing my contribution to this debate i have been advised by the confederation of british industry and many of my remarks will therefore take the opportunity to put to the house the points which industry has to make on this bill <e> <s> i should like to join with those who have congratulated my noble friend lord beltwin on the very skilful way in which he introduced this bill and the clear way in which he explained it to us <e> <s> perhaps i might also congratulate my noble friend lord sandford for having set up the stevens committee from which it all stems <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble baroness will forgive me but of course she said that <e> <s> i agree that she said that but taken in the round she said a lot of other things which negated the value of that particular contribution in her speech <e> <s> when she reads it she will find that out <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to give my support to the question that the noble lord lord walston has put down <e> <s> as befits a most excellent chairman until recently of subcommittee d which prepared the report to which so much reference has been made he has covered the ground very fully and i have little to add except to say that i hope that the minister gives proper reply to the various points that the noble lord lord walston made <e> <s> i should also like very much to support the remarks of my noble friend lady elliot of harwood as well as some of the remarks of the noble lord lord davies of leek <e> <s> i shall not elaborate on where there is any difference <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord bellwin not only for his remarks now but for the great help he has given to me during the past three or four weeks and which he gave earlier to the confederation of british industry who have been advising me <e> <s> on this specific amendment i take a certain amount of heart from the fact that my noble friend agrees there is room for finding some better phraseology <e> <s> we are not altogether happy about a gdo coverage in the same way as one is not happy about regulations <e> <s> one wants to see something in the bill itself which is a bit clearer to cover the point which i think we are all agreed is a reasonable one <e> <s> perhaps i might take this away and see if we cannot find a form of wording which would satisfy your lordships on report <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i am absolutely horrified to hear my noble friend on the front bench say that he is in agreement with the noble baroness lady birk because i think that both amendments go much too far in the way of narrowing down the definitions <e> <s> i hope very much that when my noble friend puts together some alternative he does not narrow it down to the point where it identifies each and every item that is covered in both amendments <e> <s> i also hope very much that freedom in this direction is maintained and the sense of my earlier amendment which i withdrew is one which i would recommend to my noble friend as being much more in the direction in which this total clause should move <e>", "<cs> at this stage i accept the points which my noble friend has made and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be for the convenience of the committee as was suggested by my noble friend lord boardman if we dealt with my amendments nos <e> <s> and at the same time <e> <s> they are in all but extreme detail exactly the same as his amendment <e> <s> i would not seek to add to what my noble friend lord boardman has just told the committee because it seemed to me to put the case very well indeed <e> <s> furthermore on second reading at col i made a point on this same issue as being one of the fundamental things which i took as an example to put to the house at that stage <e>", "<cs> there is just one point i might suggest in view of what has been said <e> <s> i appreciate <e>", "<cs> it being a committee stage perhaps i could take the point made by my noble friend lord nugent <e> <s> it is precisely the point he has just made that i made at second reading in order to justify the very amendment we are seeking to put forward <e> <s> it is because in the end the minerals have to be worked and in the end the local authority knows this is going to happen that it is not so necessary to have relatively narrow time limits for checking up on the process <e> <s> this is really the nub of my argument <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will see that he has actually supported me though perhaps he did not want to <e>", "<cs> i am indeed grateful to my noble friend the minister for those remarks <e> <s> perhaps i could apologise to your lordships for not saying that i wish to take amendment no <e> <s> in conjunction with this which is the scottish amendment <e> <s> i apologise for having left minerals in amendment no <e> <s> i tried hard to get them out and in some cases i succeeded but i failed in this amendment <e> <s> with the very splendid assurances of my noble friend i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am really rather sad <e> <s> perhaps it is too short a time since last october <e> <s> a sign i always think of a great minister is one who is prepared to adjust his attitude particularly when as he himself said the matter is so finely balanced <e> <s> however i appreciate that he has not <e> <s> we shall consider this at a later stage of the bill and keep our eyes sharply open for other bills in the future into which one can insert amendments of this sort without upsetting anyone at all <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that explanation <e> <s> we will look at the matter further <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and we shall give great thought to this <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with that reassurance for which i am most grateful i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too should like to add my voice of opposition <e> <s> it is a pleasure to be able to speak on the same front as the noble baroness lady birk for the first time today and probably the last <e> <s> as my noble friend the minister is well aware this proposal is anathema to industry <e> <s> in particular subsection if enacted in any form would amount to an incredible imposition on industry and as my noble friend lord ridley said i suppose that it would also be a terrible imposition on the local authority too <e> <s> i observe that my noble friend lord sandford said that this is a probing amendment <e> <s> i hope that it now disappears into the mists of the past and no one ever considers it again <e>", "<cs> i should very much like briefly to support my noble friend lord gisborough in the principle of his amendment <e> <s> i am sure that restoration in stages is a thing which needs to be considered and some of my later amendments in fact embody the same general theme <e>", "<cs> my noble friend having pleased me by moving amendment no <e> <s> which stopped my moving amendment no <e> <s> which by itself is not too objectionable then re-introduces the closely worded definition i would have sought to exclude in my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that type of detail is not necessary and may cause more trouble to mineral operators than is reasonable <e> <s> operators accept reasonable restoration conditions and these may include an obligation to plant suitable cover and restore land to reasonable agricultural or factory use <e> <s> however these detailed provisions are admittedly covered by the word may which gives a certain amount of option and could give rise to people believing that each and every stage of this will have to be followed <e> <s> it is probably wiser to leave the amendment to that provided for by amendment no <e> <s> without specifying the detail <e>", "<cs> in the event of this amendment being agreed to and it will be my amendments nos <e> <s> and will fall <e> <s> i should like to make two points <e> <s> one is that i

"<cs> with that hopeful and helpful remark i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is a kind of reassurance about the right of appeal in my noble friends reply and perhaps this is as far as i can take the matter at the moment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment does not strike us as being quite what we hoped the minister would be providing at this stage to meet the point which we tried to make under amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we shall have a look at it and we may come back to it at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i shall read with great care what my noble friend has said and consider whether to return to the charge at a later stage <e> <s> at this stage however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this clause is objectionable in that it introduces for the first time an extension of planning control to agricultural operations <e> <s> industry accepts planning conditions designed to minimise the damage to land <e> <s> there is no objection to the principle of the bill <e> <s> but the proposed after-care conditions would introduce for the first time control by a planning authority of the agricultural operations themselves <e> <s> i know that my noble friend the minister has just said that this is not the intention of the clause but as we read it now that is what it looks like <e>", "<cs> i think the burden of my argument is that whatever the machinery and i appreciate it is all one because it is all in one ministry it does not always work <e> <s> perhaps the message could go from this house to those in scotland who have to deal with these matters to take care that in the future they do get together <e> <s> in hopes that this message will go out north of the border i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear my noble friend point out the great importance to the country of this industry <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk in drawing attention to her amendment which would reduce the period to years reminds me again of the second reading debate in which i found myself saying to her that her interests as regards industry were not as strong as she spoke of them because everything good that she says about industry she completely negates by the proposals she then makes like reducing the period to years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes i note what my noble friend has said and we will take it away and examine it <e> <s> it sounds very convincing when heard like that but i think that it needs reading <e> <s> with that thought i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of the speech that my noble friend the minister has just made which really covers the main point of the object of the clause i do not think that it is in the interests of the committee that we should continue the debate <e> <s> therefore i do not propose to speak further <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could ask my noble friend the minister a small question <e> <s> i am advised that a mineral planning authority wishing to take action sooner than the five-year period or i suppose <e>", "<cs> with that reassurance and in the hope that perhaps my noble friend the minister may be able to find confirmation of my suggestion and therefore later agreement to this at this stage in the progress of the bill i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> although in no way wishing to appear to be influenced by the argument of the noble baroness lady birk i shall study with great care what my noble friend the minister has said some of which appeared to throw a slightly fresh light on the scene and make a judgment as to whether to pursue this point at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with regard to the opening remarks of the noble lord lord hunt i should have thought that he would agree that this word reasonable occurs frequently in legislation in order to provide just that bit of guidance for people involved in taking action under whatever act of parliament is concerned so that they think twice before they behave unreasonably <e> <s> this is the sole point of what i originally saw as just a drafting amendment to improve the bill rather than a great point of issue which everybody has to join in and talk about <e> <s> i think it would improve the bill <e>", "<cs> we have spent a great deal of time on this <e> <s> i would only say in answer to the noble baroness lady birk that of course people do not admit to something being unreasonable when they have already taken action <e> <s> it is what goes on before the stage of taking the action when while gazing at what is guiding you to wit the act maybe you modify your actions if you feel you will exceed the powers given to you under the act and it was along those lines that i made the point to which she took exception <e> <s> however having said all that and the subject having been well aired i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to have time to read what the noble baroness has said before i make a comment on it <e> <s> however i am reassured by what my noble friend the minister has said and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> at first sight the remarks of my noble friend seem to be satisfactory though i shall reserve the right to examine them with a view possibly to coming back with a proposal at the next stage in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it might be to the convenience of the committee if i speak to my amendment no <e> <s> because it is so wrapped up with this one at the same time <e> <s> as already explained in moving amendment no <e> <s> the vagaries of demand and of the quality of deposits being worked may result in an operator suspending work on a particular deposit for considerable periods <e> <s> he cannot predict when the relevant demand may resume and should not be put prematurely to the expense of taking additional steps to protect the environment <e> <s> the existing planning condition should be adequate <e>", "<cs> we are on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i brought in my amendment no <e> <s> before we had finished with no <e> <s> in order to help things along <e>", "<cs> i will examine carefully what my noble friend has said <e> <s> at first hearing it

amendment <e>", "<cs> it is not a sufficient point about which to make a great issue but this time i do not agree with my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i shall almost certainly return on this point later <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i very much welcome this amendment and thank my noble friend the minister for it <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord gisborough <e> <s> his amendment is excellent and replaces the one that i did not move no <e> <s> which is in default as compared with his <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support this amendment by my noble friend <e> <s> it takes the place of my amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> we are grateful to him for it <e>", "<cs> having listened with care to what the noble baroness lady birk has said and also to the remarks of my noble friend the minister i consider there is quite a lot to be said for their respective arguments <e> <s> at this stage therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to welcome this amendment on the part of my noble friend which encompasses that which i would have moved in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i thank him very much <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene at this point i should like to talk to amendment no <e> <s> which contains another way of saying the same thing <e> <s> perhaps i could explain in rather greater detail than my noble friend lord sandford what we see as being the reasoning behind both amendments <e> <s> i am open to accept either amendment depending on which the government might prefer <e> <s> as i see it the basic reasons are that the division of planning responsibilities between the county and district councils was as the government claim clarified in the local government planning and land act <e> <s> clause of this bill expressly defines mineral planning authority as the county authority <e> <s> thus counties are solely and clearly responsible for mineral planning and it follows that they should also be solely and clearly responsible for any consequential enforcement action <e> <s> that is the intention behind my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> without this change districts would in effect be entitled to undermine the countys authority and would engender uncertainty in the minerals industry <e>", "<cs> when we come to my amendment i shall not be moving it being satisfied with the assurances given by my noble friend the minister <e>", "<cs> i shall have pleasure in reading carefully my noble friends remarks and will consider <e>", "<cs> in view of the fact that my noble friend the minister was not clear as to the purpose of the amendment perhaps he too will find when he reads my explanation that he has a slightly different view as to its desirability <e> <s> perhaps we could talk about the matter between this stage and the next to find out whether either of us would care to come forward with this amendment or something else in its place <e> <s> would my noble friend agree to that course of action <e>", "<cs> with that happy assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his reply and have pleasure in withdrawing the amendment <e>", "<cs> with that very clear explanation from my noble friend the minister i am predisposed to accept it but i shall take care to examine it carefully and possibly come back to it at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i understand it and i think that my noble friend explained this these amendments will enable a planning authority to impose an aftercare condition on any permission granted before the commencement of clause without having to pay full compensation <e> <s> at first sight this may seem a reasonable transitional provision designed to avoid the authority having to wait five years before imposing after-care conditions such as the industry would accept as part of a properly balanced stevens-style package <e>", "<cs> bluntly my answer is no i do not <e> <s> i am not sure whether the committee as a whole sees it my way and in any case it is part of a package and i feel that the time to discuss the inter-relationship of the compensation and length of time involved in this and other amendments is better dealt with when we come to the clause stand part <e> <s> so at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this clause is a lead-in to other clauses relating to compensation in particular clause <e> <s> as members of the committee know very well after thorough consideration the stevens committee recommended a package of two interrelated components long-term security of planning permissions for the minerals industry in exchange for a reasonable contribution by the industry to the costs direct or indirect of meeting revised conditions <e> <s> that is the nub of the argument <e>", "<cs> that is a very pleasant reassurance to have from my noble friend the minister <e> <s> it is all very well to say that secretaries of state are always consulting <e> <s> of course they are <e> <s> but there is so much time spent consulting on those factors which are written into bills where it says that they will do so such as i am seeking to put into this bill that maybe they do not have time to consult on things where it does not say that in the bill <e> <s> the point of it is that if it was never in a bill and it was one of the accepted things in the country that secretaries of state always consulted with interested parties that would be something else <e> <s> but if that were so it would not be necessary to say that they must consult when it appears in other bills <e> <s> if in thinking about this and i am delighted that my noble friend has said that he will do this he also reflects on what i have said i should be delighted at this stage to withdraw the amendment and perhaps put something else down at a later stage <e>", "<cs> from that rather guarded undertaking on the part of my noble friend the minister i derive some satisfaction and at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall have a good look at what my noble friend has said and indeed at what the noble baroness has said with regard to this amendment <e> <s> i must confess that i am disappointed <e> <s> i rather thought that my noble friend might be more enthusiastic than he has turned out to be about this amendment <e> <s> i shall have to take it away and have a good look at it and maybe come back later <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to hear that but i shall read with great interest the report of what my noble friend has said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> again i will study what has been said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that is more encouraging than a few of the answers which i have received <e> <s> with that modified assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i will certainly read my noble friends remarks with great interest and at this stage beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not keep your lordships for long <e> <s> i was about to say and i do say that i so thoroughly endorse all that was said by my noble friend lord home of the hirsel that i have very little to add to what he has said except to underline a couple of points <e> <s> however having said <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by adding my own congratulations to those extended to my noble friend lord noel-buxton <e> <s> he was of course very fully and expertly praised and nicely praised by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter but there is one particular point while endorsing all that that i should like to make <e> <s> again it is somewhat unusual for somebody in his profession the lightness of touch <e> <s> with the greatest respect to any other solicitors who might be in the chamber if the noble lord lord mishcon thinks i am referring to him he too of course has this delightful lightness of touch it is relatively rare in their profession if i may say so <e> <s> i too say how we hope to hear our noble friend speaking to us many more times and giving us the benefit of his great wisdom and experience <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has another argument <e> <s> if that be so and i think it might be i rather feel from having studied what people have told me and from looking at the bill and doing this terrible thing that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter mentioned namely trailing through i do not know how many different acts of parliament to get at the solution of what is actually intended by the government that it would be worth consolidating this now regardless of what is to come in the future to hell with that consolidate it again in shall we say four years time or whatever <e> <s> i know that that means a lot of extra work for a lot of no doubt very clever lawyers and i am sure that they have not got lightness of touch who would resist that to the umpteenth degree <e> <s> however i really think the government have got to take this bull by the horns be firm with the people who provide a service to them and make sure that this particular point is dealt with and dealt with quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord kaldor will forgive me if i do not follow him precisely <e> <s> i wish to try to restrict my remarks to one particular subject to which i shall come in a minute <e> <s> in any case i am sure that my noble friend the minister of state if he has not done so already will be able to answer very satisfactorily the points that have been made by the noble lord lord kaldor <e>", "<cs> my lords before addressing myself to my noble friends remarks perhaps i could address some remarks to the noble baroness lady birk who was as it were taking me to task for having the effrontery to come back with a different amendment <e> <s> i would invite her to look at my closing remarks at col where i said <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pity about the last remarks <e> <s> i was about to accept the whole thing <e> <s> everything i say in this house i believe to be sensible including when i pull the noble baronesss leg <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i would take issue with my noble friend lord nugent on one point only because i quite understand the gist of what he

yesterday when i even started it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should briefly like to welcome this amendment and to thank my noble friend for having put it forward and for following up on our previous discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no objection whatsoever to the amendment of my noble friend lord nugent of guildford but i am slightly alarmed at the amendment of the noble baroness in relation to current mineral workings <e> <s> if in what he is to set up the minister is to be guided by the amendment of the noble baroness we have no objection to the principle rather than by the amendment of my noble friend lord nugent bearing in mind that the minister said that he will consult the local authorities can he give me an assurance that he will consult also the mineral operators <e> <s> it could make quite a difference for the mineral operators if they were to know when they were to be surveyed <e> <s> it would seem to me that there is nothing worse than a local authority official travelling perhaps miles and back in a large car merely to ask a question or to see whether a gate is closed <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend can give me the kind of assurance that i seek

idea <e> <s> i have no brief for the landowners but to say that it is the first time is not necessarily an excellent argument <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept what my noble friend has said i should

best <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank my noble friend the minister for having done his best to meet some of the points which i raised in amendments during earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> unfortunately <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to my noble friend the minister for the even-handed and even-tempered way in which he has taken this splendid bill through your lordships house <e> <s> it is a good thing and i think that we would recognise this from the mineral operators point of view just as much as from anybody elses that the stevens report at any rate in part is now on its way to enactment <e> <s> that is perhaps a tribute to my noble friend lord sandford who set up the stevens committee <e> <s> indeed it may be that our good temper if that is the right way of putting it is a reflection of the fact that he selected a diplomat to chair the stevens committee and that that has made its way through to us in our debates <e>", "<cs> my

reasonable and fair solution is reached in relation to part iv-a of this bill <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support what the noble baroness lady phillips has said <e> <s> if the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran would turn to line on page he would find that the whole of clause relates to small companies <e> <s> the point he makes is covered <e> <s> i should like to suggest that because it is small companies perhaps the noble lord lord bruce of donington would like to think again because surely the creditors whose interests must be supported will obtain more than enough information from other sources without having this particular piece of information which the bill seeks to cut out <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord not believe in view of the fact that he withdrew amendment no <e>

is therefore no clause b <e> <s> this clause is meaningless and speaking to an amendment can only have the ultimate object of the amendment being incorporated in the bill <e> <s> but if the amendment

order to speak to it and indeed to progress further with this amendment <e>", "<cs> may i suggest to the noble lord that the way he could have done that as he was talking to an imaginary and non-existent subsection would have been to talk on the question whether clause should stand part of the bill and not take up the time of the committee in dealing with an amendment which is meaningless

of the size of a <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down would he not perhaps agree that the one thing he has missed out the important point which my noble and learned friend made and the noble lord has done this consistently over the last few amendments that he has been speaking to is the competitive aspect <e> <s> in fact at one stage he said he did not think that competition was a very good thing or words to that effect <e> <s> i think the noble lord was exaggerating when he talked about the work force because we are talking about small firms by any standards and people in such

widely read in this bill than i am and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if it is as simple as that then i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before i deal with this matter i should like to ask my noble and learned friend a question <e> <s> he mentioned that there were no objections to this when the directive was being negotiated <e> <s> can he give me a rough

responsibility of directors to ensure that their directors report contains all the information necessary for their shareholders it is very much their important responsibility <e> <s> it could be considered an infringement of their responsibilities and duties almost one might say an encouragement to them not to take their responsibilities as seriously as they do for auditors to have to verify

do as a matter of course <e> <s> to have their hand held by statute seems almost an insult <e> <s> i suggest therefore that the whole clause could well be omitted <e>", "<cs> i shall read with care what my noble and learned friend has said and consider whether to return to the charge at a later stage in the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before proceeding further could my noble and learned friend tell me whether in the terms of the bill the government will have the power effectively to introduce my proposed paragraph <e>", "<cs> once again i

stage <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the explanation is of no assistance because my noble friend did not answer my point about the word undesirable nor did he deal with the fact that i was trying to ensure that what is contained in section of the act is included in the bill <e> <s> i shall not pursue the matter <e> <s> i noted that my noble and learned friend the lord advocate said that he would look closely at this point <e> <s> as i said earlier i hope indeed that he will since there is no doubt that we are all very disturbed about it <e> <s> i very much take the point that the noble lord lord mishcon made namely if there are names and only complaints it cannot be as my noble and learned friend has said that there is a problem of being unable to cope with the large number of names <e> <s> that does not add up it is not logic <e> <s> having said that at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my

he has to leave before the end of the debate may i say that i wonder whether he is aware how grateful i am to him for joining in and giving us the benefit of his great expertise in the deliberations which are mainly associated with sub-committee d <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour it would not be appropriate for me to respond to what my noble friend on the front bench has just said and i

in speaking to your lordships i have been advised by the confederation of british industry and also the national farmers union of the isle of wight <e> <s> my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak to the amendment until i heard the noble lord lord boston who seemed to make very much a point for not having the bill at all let alone in his opinion not making this amendment <e> <s> one wants to relate the complicated picture he presented on the one hand to the real cases which the noble baroness lady wootton told us about because i suspect that the real cases are all from what one might call honest sensible christian people <e> <s> one should remember what the right reverend prelate the bishop of norwich said namely that we need to see the outcome of this in the real world <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like to ask my noble friends on the front bench or somewhere else this question <e> <s> all the arguments which have been put for including an amendment relating to scotland would surely apply equally to northern ireland <e> <s> i am a little puzzled as to why that has not been included also in this bill for the same tidying-up reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords before other noble lords speak perhaps i might have an answer to the question which i asked in relation to the last amendment why if all this argument is advanced for amending the law of scotland is there no provision in the bill for amending the law of northern ireland <e> <s> it seems to me that exactly the same arguments apply particularly over the reverse gretna argument <e> <s> i do not see why northern ireland is not given treatment equally as unfair and unreasonable as that for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the tenor of the remarks made by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i would also confirm to the noble lord that the amendment which he has put before us is not ideal but i am delighted to see it on the marshalled list because i believe that it is indeed unfortunate that the government have not managed to make up their minds about the amendment which as has been stated my noble friend lord trefgarne promised to us at report stage <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will allow me to say that i wrote to him suggesting that it would be a courtesy on the part of the government if they were to allow this house to complete its business with this amendment rather than rely on the fact that the bill will go to another place so that we would have an opportunity to resolve the matter once and for all here <e> <s> i consider it extremely unfortunate that for one reason or another although we now hear about a meeting at which perhaps certain advances were made nothing has been put before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a brief intervention at this stage in the debate <e> <s> i apologise deeply to your lordships for being too late to speak earlier in the debate <e> <s> i had hoped that the earlier speakers would speak a little longer <e> <s> in any event i must apologise also to the earlier speakers for not being present at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> i want to make only two points on this general subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i too congratulate my noble friend lady vickers on tabling a question relating to this extremely important service <e> <s> i also congratulate the hydrographer and all his people not only for the work they do but for the excellent report they have made <e> <s> i am deeply concerned about the future not just of the hydrographic department but of all things maritime in relation to this country <e> <s> we depend greatly on the sea even now for all sorts of things and i am delighted to see that the noble lord lord peart will be speaking from the opposition front bench <e> <s> he may remember that we had a debate on fish not long ago in which i was advancing the same thought namely that people are forgetting that the roots of this country rest in the sea <e> <s> that applies not only to what i might call the defence aspect in the royal navy it applies to all sorts of other activities <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend allow me <e> <s> does he not think that at the beginning of this century that craft would have been built by now instead of going out to tender <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow the noble lady lady saltoun because i agree so much with what she has had to say <e> <s> we will come to that later <e> <s> i would like to thank my noble friend lord bellwin as so many have for introducing the bill so skilfully <e> <s> i am sorry he is not here to hear me say that <e> <s> there is one point that i think noble lords opposite made rather an issue of <e> <s> they spoke of the bill being one which has many sections and parts in it and covering a wide range <e> <s> i do not see why we should get fussed about that <e> <s> we have many bills like that <e> <s> not very long ago my noble friend lord bellwin took through a local government bill which also covered a very wide range of subjects and at the end everybody congratulated him on it <e> <s> so i do not think that that is an important issue <e>", "<cs> hurray my lords i hear hear hear <e> <s> from all round the chamber <e>", "<cs> while having great sympathy in broad principle for what the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has proposed i think he has given far too many diverse jobs to this body <e> <s> i do not believe they will be able to do any of them properly <e> <s> if he was attacking on a narrower front it would be much easier to see whether one could support him <e> <s> when the time comes i hope that the noble lord will withdraw his amendment and then narrow it right down <e> <s> there will be a very real problem for the government <e> <s> forgetting all about looking after consumers interests and the rest very good technical advice will be needed in order to combat the statutory advice which it will have to take from british telecom <e> <s> it is most unfortunate that in many places in this bill the government are statutorily required i believe this was inserted in another place to consult british telecommunications <e> <s> they are required to consult bt about all sorts of things <e> <s> i see great difficulty over getting the right sort of expertise <e> <s> to that extent it may be that an independent body might be a good thing in order to provide another source of information <e> <s> but that would overcomplicate <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend very much for his clear explanation <e> <s> i also thank the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for taking up this particular point about the fact that the bill itself in clause says only <e>", "<cs> my noble friends speech if he will forgive me saying so was very much like the curates egg <e> <s> i understand what he is saying but i do not entirely accept it all <e> <s> the earlier part of his speech so far as i can see was seeking to criticise my amendment on the grounds that any installation and maintenance that might be done independently of the post office might harm the network <e> <s> my amendment begins with a reference to section which is the very one which makes it quite certain that you cannot do anything without having obtained approval from the government regarding the quality of your equipment <e>", "<cs> i hope that as they continue with these arguments the opposition will stop saying no criticism of professor beesley he did a very bad job but that was not his fault that was the governments fault because they constrained him <e> <s> that is nonsense <e> <s> first this report contains much solid good practical and technical commonsense <e> <s> secondly those areas which the opposition are attacking are areas which the government have as their their basic policy for this bill anyhow <e> <s> whether or not there was beesley the bill would be roughly in this shape <e> <s> in fact it was because as the noble lord lord underhill has just said beesleys report was not published until after the bill had been through the other place <e> <s> so the opposition are miscasting their criticism of the beesley report <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my remarks to that <e> <s> in earlier amendments i was objecting to the fact that in clause <e>", "<cs> there are problems over importing clauses from the act <e> <s> the government need to think very carefully before doing so <e> <s> i had to say this regarding an earlier amendment <e> <s> the government are putting british telecom into a rather peculiar hybrid situation because they will be partly in authority under clause giving licences and so on and partly in fierce competition with the rest of the industry <e> <s> this is a very difficult role for them to perform <e> <s> secondly this subsection may not be suitable for this bill <e> <s> if it was suitable when the post office was a wholly monopolistic organisation and when it faced no competition at all such a subsection will not necessarily be appropriate to this new hybrid creature which the government are creating by this bill <e> <s> the government ought to look carefully at all the clauses which they have imported from the act and ask themselves whether they are really appropriate for this new competitive creature <e> <s> i am not saying that it should not be competitive <e> <s> i think that it should that part of the bill is excellent <e> <s> on the other hand british telecom have got to behave like a competitive free enterprise outfit which does not have too many ministerial duties delegated to it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for clarifying the issue and for explaining how limited the liabilities now are as opposed to what they were <e> <s> i am not altogether happy with what i think he said but i shall read his remarks in <e>", "<cs> when the current companies bill went through your lordships house we made the point that a consolidated companies bill would be of extreme value to the country <e> <s> i suspect that this interchange on this amendment gives point to that <e> <s> perhaps the government could take note about the need for a consolidated companies act as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> before the debate ends i wonder whether the noble and learned lord who moved the amendment can explain why there appears to be no reference to scotland in subsection <e> <s> are the scots to be freed from this special provision for a special reason <e>", "<cs> i think that i shall have to read with care what my noble friend has said <e> <s> fortunately there will be later stages of this bill and it may be that i shall return to the charge when i have had time to examine what my noble friend has said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i say that i too am not in the least convinced by my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i was most disappointed in what he had to say as a reflection on the principle of liberalising the whole area of telecommunications <e> <s> i think it would be much more in accord with the general thinking of my noble friend and those of us who sit on these benches if he would find his way to being more flexible in considering this point <e> <s> it is ridiculous to write off small local authorities as not being people who are perfectly capable of running particular services at a profit which is what we are talking about or at least under profitable circumstances <e> <s> without wishing to offend the noble lords on the nearer benches opposite i feel that it is an area which is worthy of proper consideration and could usefully be expanded although perhaps not at this stage of the bill <e> <s> i thoroughly support the noble lord in the general principle of what he is trying to do <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be able to assist my noble friends <e> <s> at the time when we were discussing clause stand part it was said that this would be one of the consequential amendments if clause was left out which it was <e>", "<cs> i was distressed to hear the noble lord lord glenamara issue threats as part of his speech <e> <s> he seemed to feel that monopoly was sacrosanct and that monopoly controlled not only the post office but was the best way of handling things <e> <s> he must have witnessed over the last years that monopoly systems have not worked as efficiently as i am sure everybody hoped they would when they set them up in the first place <e> <s> in fact in general terms for all sorts of reasons the post office is not providing as good a service today as it did years ago so there is surely some justification for thinking there could be arguments for having some of the responsibilities of the post office freed liberalised as my noble friends call it so that other people can take them up and at least provide some measure of competition against which the post office can measure its own performance <e>", "<cs> i have some experience of the american post office which has consistently been inferior to ours and is today but i do not think its standard has changed much over the last years <e> <s> i do not know for what reason at least i have my own ideas but i would not advance them at this stage but the standard of our post office back in the s was infinitely superior to what it is now <e> <s> the american post office which is worse has been pretty consistent and i would say the same of the french post office <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might intervene before the noble lord replies <e> <s> i qualified as a naval signal officer in and had dealings thereafter with cable and wireless for many years with the greatest possible regard throughout all those years for the high quality of cable and wireless <e> <s> the only point i should like to make is that at the time i qualified cable and wireless was an independent company before its nationalisation <e> <s> it was of a very high quality then <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not think that it was fair if some sort of assistance could be given to the private protesters of the local area in this particular case <e> <s> they have collected money and fought three times and really to go round the buoy again on what will be substantially the same sort of evidence seems to me to be most unfair <e> <s> if any money is to be given to anybody whether it be the local authority or the british airports authority then surely it would be reasonable for private individuals who represent the local community in a more direct sense to get something as well <e>", "<cs> i think it would be reasonable to assume that the people running british rail are good sensible people who will be fully aware of the points made by the noble lord lord mishcon and if they decide that they want to sell a larger share than he is proposing they will surely do so with full cognisance of the implications of it <e> <s> as it stands they are given sufficient power to retain control to the degree to which he said <e> <s> i should have thought that if british rail is being run by people who are so ignorant and incompetent as the noble lord and the noble viscount were almost suggesting perhaps it is as well that they should have only a minority control because they are not really capable of running anything <e>", "<cs> i am really a complete ignoramus on these matters <e> <s> on many occasions i do not agree with or even understand what my noble friend on the front bench not this one says <e> <s> however in this case the argument that he advances seems so very clear and understandable that i do not know what the amendment is all about <e> <s> why bother with it <e> <s> may i suggest that we move on as quickly as we can and forget this one <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend very much for that very full explanation and of course i admit that i did not expect that my amendment would fall precisely into the necessary pattern <e> <s> but what my noble friend said threw up one question for me <e> <s> am i to understand that sealink will form a subsidiary to run all the harbours listed in subsection and that in effect there will be no local operating body because sealink itself will have a local manager running the ships <e> <s> but how about the harbours <e> <s> will they be run only by the company based in say london liverpool or wherever it is which looks after all the <e>", "<cs> that is extremely kind of my noble friend <e> <s> with that reassurance i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i find the remarks delicately and splendidly put of both the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble lord lord underhill quite odd because i remember so well some five years ago sitting on the benches opposite and hearing it being put across from this side of the house by the then labour government how important it was to have all sorts of safeguards of the secretary of states control over the companies which at that stage were going to be nationalised <e> <s> they were so keen to make sure that the companies were really under their thumb and we kept on saying to them dont you trust them <e> <s> you are nationalising them why dont you trust them <e> <s> and they said yes of course we trust them but we still think we should have this small power <e> <s> in the end one had to accept it and one understood it <e> <s> if the noble viscount lord simon makes those remarks one sympathises and understands because he has been neutral in these battles both times and is sitting on the same benches but for it to come from the labour party that they think it is unreasonable to have an underpinning in a bill for the secretary of state to have last resort powers of whatever sort seems to me to be not really compatible with what they have done in their own time <e>", "<cs> this amendment worries me <e> <s> in the isle of wight where we have part of the sealink services and the harbours to which the noble lord lord underhill has referred we have never had british rail police and would never expect to have them <e> <s> if his shall is turned into must that might mean that they have to be inflicted upon us <e> <s> it could be that we have what are called the ordinary police because of some association with the fact that we have vast prisons in the isle of wight and this is something which it would not be fair to put upon the railway police <e> <s> but whatever the situation may be it is not an open-and-shut situation that the railway police look after all the harbours of sealink <e> <s> therefore turning this into an obligatory commitment as opposed to shall would probably be unwise <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene before my noble friend speaks i am absolutely astonished at the noble lord lord underhill saying that this is reasonable <e> <s> i cannot understand why those intelligent noble lords opposite do not seem to understand the fundamentals and the benefits of private enterprise <e> <s> all this grabbing to try to keep control and to give everybody a chance to talk do not let them be free they say <e> <s> that is what this amendment says and i think that it is absolute nonsense <e>", "<cs> i was about to leap to my feet to say that i should prefer it if my noble friend would not do that as i wish to raise my point separately <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene but i would very much like to make a speech in support of my noble friend <e> <s> however i do want to advance my own argument for my own amendment <e> <s> i am extremely sorry for my noble friend on the front bench but please would he leave me alone until i come to my amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord lucas and to reserve all my comments on what my noble friend on the front bench has said in relation to ships agents <e> <s> i noted much of what he said <e> <s> indeed i may have to ask him to repeat it because it is most confusing to have ones amendment answered in the main by the reply to someone elses amendment <e> <s> i tried to point this out to my noble friend <e> <s> i believe that my normally very courteous friend on the front bench has made it extraordinarily difficult for me to tackle my amendment when i come to it <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for apologising for taking my amendment with the amendment of my noble friend <e> <s> i think we both feel that it was a pity because neither of us has been able to deploy our arguments and of course the report stage is another stage <e> <s> in view of the complications that have arisen and bearing in mind the possible tone of slight irritation on my part i hope that when my noble friend looks at the matter again as he has very kindly said he will he does so from a standpoint not of trying to put up barriers to prove the point that the paragraph should remain in the bill which i could well understand him and his advisers wanting to do but of asking whether the paragraph is really necessary <e> <s> what will associated british ports lose by not having this particular provision written into the legislation <e> <s> if it is omitted chartered ship brokers will be able to operate in the ports as they now do in per cent <e> <s> of the ports of the world and there will be nothing to stop associated british ports appointing their own agent because there is no law against doing that <e> <s> the point is that there is no need to include this in the form of a statutory permission <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly suggest that my noble and learned friend on the front bench should go back to the middle ages and give us only the church as sanctuary <e> <s> a cold church on a winters night would surely be sobering up for anybody <e>", "<cs> i think that this is the moment for <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in his amendment <e> <s> the principle behind his amendment was established back in <e> <s> one can really see why it was a

railway trains operating at the moment <e> <s> however there is a great enthusiasm for old steam engines <e> <s> there is the great museum at york and if members of the committee have not done so i thoroughly recommend a visit <e> <s> these trains are taken out and steamed round the country <e> <s> i know that british rail wants to go electric and one must not look too far ahead but the oil will run out and no doubt when it does people will find a way of converting coal to oil and perhaps that will not make a difference <e> <s> however who is to know that steam engines which are very efficient machines in their own bases might not come back again over the centuries <e>", "<cs> i am indeed reassured by my noble friend lord avon that the trrl looked more widely than just at their own experiments <e> <s> i appreciated the point he made about parliament having restricted the length of those experiments <e> <s> i take it absolutely from him that they looked at ireland and indeed elsewhere in the world <e> <s> with that reassurance i feel we can accept the fact though perhaps we shall come back to parliament in years time and see whether this has been effective or whether everyone has been doing what my noble friend lord lucas suggested which sounded much more like a steeplechase than motorbike riding <e> <s> i thank my noble friend for assisting me and with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can assist my noble friend <e> <s> is it not clause which contains the relevant negative procedure <e>", "<cs> i get the gist of what my noble friend has said <e> <s> the second paragraph of his noble friends letter was indeed much more succinct much more to the point and much more convincing <e> <s> i wrote back to my noble friend lord bellwin and said that i thought it was so good that i was putting down this amendment so that he might convey the gist of that in answer to this question <e> <s> somehow the machinery within his department with the greatest possible respect to it seems to have failed to take cognisance of this point <e> <s> i am sorry for your lordships because you would much rather have heard the second paragraph than what my noble friend lord avon has just declared to you <e> <s> however it is true that although it is not the gist of it because it is three times as long the sense is vaguely the same <e> <s> that is people will use their common sense and we will not be littered with humps and where road narrowing is better we will have that <e> <s> that is the gist of my noble friends letter and having said that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall not be diverted <e> <s> it applies equally to our colleagues in another place <e> <s> there is a danger that the government might be so worried about not causing too much trouble for the police and their own officials that they try excessively to safeguard against the lunatic fringe and it is here that one must judge and weigh up the situation <e>", "<cs> i am both slightly pleased and slightly disappointed at my noble friends reply <e> <s> i thought it was a little unfortunate that he had to fall back on the rough justice argument particularly as the noble lord lord underhill had reminded him of it <e> <s> it is all very well to speak about rough justice <e> <s> people who try to operate and make a success of their business and do not want to have to pay a penny more than is <e>", "<cs> my lords in the mid-sixties i had the good fortune to live for a year in canada where the telephone is produced by the bell telephone company <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that not only did they provide the telephones the people in the towns and cities and rural areas needed but they did it more cheaply <e> <s> one of the reasons they managed to do this was by not wasting a lot of money on trying to underpin things in an orderly bureaucratic fashion <e> <s> the other reason was that if the communities reckoned they were not getting the service they wanted they jolly well found it themselves <e> <s> the did not think they had to fall back on auntie government to provide it for them they thought they had to get on and do it and they negotiated hard and they found the money collectively and all sorts of things like that <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister confirm that what he said earlier in his speech indicated that where this clause mentions british islands it is not as i had assumed the islands surrounding britain but the british isles as i learnt about them in school including the republic of ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i admit to the fact that i had to find some way of doing it without frightening my noble friend that i was going to cut something vital out of the bill <e> <s> it occurred to me that perhaps my noble friend lord morris would like to do his own maintenance and pass the necessary examinations <e> <s> in a way these exemptions apply to business <e> <s> however having said that very briefly i thank my noble friend and i understand of course that like myself he is not as expert in this area as we should like to be and i look forward to receiving a letter from him i hope reasonably soon <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> before i go on he said there is already provision within clause for outside consultation but he did not as is normally the case draw my attention to just where that provision might be <e> <s> is he able to do that for me <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord lyell and indeed my noble friend lord morris for clarifying the issue and indeed giving point to the underlying submissions which gave rise to my amendment at this stage and at committee stage <e> <s> this is not a satisfactory situation and neither is it satisfactory that there is something in the bill that provides for consultation because as my noble friend lord morris has said even that is not all that helpful <e> <s> i believe that what my shipping friends have to do is to wait until this bill is enacted and then as quick as may be put in a request for coast stations for a group of shipping companies as has been suggested and see what happens <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down perhaps i may draw his attention to clause which was the one i sought to amend before which gives the let-out to british telecom <e>", "<cs> i must thank both my noble friends particularly my noble friend lord lyell for his closing remarks <e> <s> of course nobody will ever supply them to him it would not suit them to do so <e> <s> but it would be very nice to get the figures <e> <s> i really think if i may speak on behalf of my noble friend lord morris that they have both told me the same story that is that a contract which is not in a scheme is a contract <e> <s> that is very useful to have in print <e> <s> i thank my noble friends very much and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend the leader of the house for making this statement which i very much welcome <e> <s> he was referring very much to the future <e> <s> can he tell the house whether it is the governments intention still to leave on the table the existing offer they have for this year <e>", "<cs> my lords this is neither the time nor the place to express my deep concern at the governments recent actions with regard to the royal navy <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will be able to assure us that a proper debate on defence will take place before the summer recess <e> <s> we could then express our views in proper circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure and indeed an honour to follow the noble lord lord scanlon in his position as president and chief executive of the engineering industry training board <e> <s> one could not obtain a better knowledge of how things work than from such a source as he <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble lord lord tordoff for what was as other noble lords have said a brilliant maiden speech and also for such a fluent maiden speech <e> <s> when most of us start on this great track we sometimes <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down and to put the record straight may i reassure him that my salary was not decimated as a result of the act <e> <s> it was affected which was the reason why i felt i had to apply the addison rules to myself <e> <s> i should not like the record to give the impression that i was in penury because of my noble friends act <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly although there is really nothing to say but i wanted particularly to endorse what my noble friend lord buxton said covering all the ground in exactly the way that i would too <e> <s> i should also like not only to tell the noble lord lord shackleton that i read when he produced it all his report including the annex but i so much endorse what he had to say about the endurance <e> <s> i shall come back to that subject on th july <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her support and i trust that my noble friend the minister will take note of what can happen <e> <s> we are talking over a period of years or so if not more <e> <s> these things do happen <e> <s> i fully accept the fact that my amendment is not perfectly drafted and that we might be doing more favour to ireland than perhaps i was intending but with all that there is an underlying problem here which perhaps in the event is going to be so far ahead that most of us in the chamber at the moment will cease to have worried about it because we shall not want to travel any more <e> <s> there is this problem i know it has happened in parts of canada for example and it is the sort of thing that must be watched <e> <s> people can fall on hard times and withdraw what are thought to be essential services by those who are provided with them <e> <s> having aired the point fully i shall read in <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble viscount has pointed out this is a similar amendment to the one that i put forward in committee and slightly different from the one i have now put down <e> <s> i propose if the minister agrees to speak in general terms to this amendment and to reserve the right to move my amendment if i am not happy about the outcome of this one <e>", "<cs> my lords again before my noble friend sits down may i ask whether he is aware that his reply to the debate was most uncharacteristic of him and most inadequate <e> <s> and is the noble viscount aware that if he cares to test the feeling of the house i shall be delighted to support him <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not disagree more with the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> i think that my noble friend has got a point <e> <s> it sounds as though the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby is essentially a pedestrian and has not had the bitter experience of being had up for speeding when he really has not been speeding as opposed to being had up for speeding when he really has <e> <s> i recognise the difference <e> <s> i fully admit that it has happened to me <e> <s> it is very good to have a discretion here <e> <s> there are so many times when one can inadvertently drive too fast <e> <s> the road is clear you are not doing any harm to anybody but technically you are going slightly too fast <e> <s> i admit that there are other times when you are in a frightful hurry and when you hope desperately that there is no policeman near you but sometimes there is <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby is speaking very much from the point of view of the pedestrian <e> <s> therefore i ask my noble and learned friend to forget what he said and to turn back to the very excellent arguments of my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i ask having been approached since the committee stage whether i am right in thinking that it will be compulsory to pass two tests or is it optional <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lady lady saltoun has asked me to speak on her behalf as she is unable to be here today <e> <s> she wrote on th june to my noble and learned friend the lord advocate <e> <s> i do not know whether he has had an opportunity to see her letter but the substance of it and it involved a question was that she was satisfied that it was in effect bringing the law of england and wales into line with the law of scotland on the principle of entry by the police under certain circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for this amendment and indeed there will be many others <e> <s> if he will forgive me i shall not thank him each time <e> <s> however we are deeply grateful for the amendments like this one to which he has referred in which proposals that were made in this house have at last found their way into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be aware that in this matter i have been advised by the cbi so noble lords will expect me to talk in terms of their thinking <e> <s> the amendment is welcomed by industry and by the mining industry in particular <e> <s> the clause as originally drafted gave to any secretary of state in effect the right to require any operator to write a blank cheque every five years <e> <s> it was obviously essential that the basic parameters of the compensation formula needed to be inserted in the bill so that industry had some idea of what it was being asked to pay and my noble friend has just given us some useful figures to show just what that might be <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord gifford has called our attention to clause <e> <s> having looked at the clause it seems to me that he did the well-known thing of quoting part of subsection but did not go on to subsections and where the point on which he is disturbed about the secretary of states being involved in making a decision is pre-eminent <e> <s> quoting clause as an example as a clause probably does not support his case <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we speak from alternative sides of the chamber do we not <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might continue with my question to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that his remarks will be welcomed as bearing out what the monopolies and mergers commission recommended and that it will be unquestionably in the interests of consumers <e> <s> but is it not a very long time to phase out the retailing operation over the whole of five years <e> <s> is there any possibility that when experience has been gained after say two years this process could be expedited and that the three years that the monopolies and mergers commission recommended could be adhered to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i do not know whether it is worded correctly but the principle behind it is i think absolutely right <e> <s> i hope that if my noble friend the minister cannot accept it he will at least make it clear to us that in practical terms a reasonable excuse would be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords may i with trepidation suggest to my noble friend that while it is entirely his business if he has two regulations instead of one he kindly said when we noted that he was going to accept amendment nos <e> <s> a and b that he would listen with care to all the amendments that we have been discussing over the past two or three hours <e> <s> he said that he would take note of them with a view to their being incorporated in regulations if that suited him <e> <s> some of these points would be relevant to both sets of regulations in relation to the clause which we are considering and also the one relating to children <e> <s> though the regulations might be separate when considering the points we are raising in the debate under the general headings of these amendments could my noble friend give me an assurance that where relevant he will consider the points for both the regulations if they are applicable <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e> <s> on question amendment agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to support my noble friend lord inglewood for the reasons that he and my noble friend lord brougham have just given <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down there are two questions to which i should be grateful for answers which he did not give me <e> <s> one is what about the ancient vehicles going on the london to brighton race <e> <s> the other is does my noble friend intend it was not clear from what he said to take account of the points that i suggested to him should be criteria for consideration in some respects in the regulations when they are drawn up and in other respects as a point to be taken into account before regulations are brought into force <e> <s> i was not clear whether he was prepared to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i indeed thank my noble friend lord nugent for his remarks <e> <s> i am not entirely happy about the situation and may well come back to it at third reading <e> <s> for this stage of the bill i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i am not talking out of turn in reminding my noble friend lord nugent that schedule to the road traffic act refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly support the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> i live in a part of the country where it is difficult to pass on the roads <e> <s> they are narrow but there are passing places <e> <s> i see the point and entirely agree with it <e> <s> i commend it to my noble friend as something which could be reasonably accepted particularly as we understand that it is already in the <e>", "<cs> my lords having got over the technicalities i should like to thank my noble friend lord nugent of guildford for adding this clause and for giving us the affirmative resolution to support his particular amendment with which i do not agree <e> <s> however it has given us a good chance to have a bash at it again later on <e> <s> i thank my noble friend very much <e>", "<cs> my lords if i might support my noble friends amendment to which my name is also added as i understand it perhaps the sense of this amendment will be accepted by the minister but not the text <e> <s> when he comes to take note of the text i do not agree with one feature of it which says three months warning <e> <s> i think we must give the public more than that <e> <s> three months would be fine if you were dealing with the likes of us or trade associations or people like that but the public is going to need more time to absorb this <e> <s> it is quite a draconian imposition on them whatever you may think <e> <s> i think they are going to have to get settled down to it and know what is in mind in good time <e> <s> so i should like to suggest to my noble friend the minister that six months would be a better figure when he comes to think it all out <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may suggest that the reason why my noble friend the duke of norfolk was in advance is that the noble lord lord ross is so ponderously slow and we all want to go faster than he does <e> <s> we should like to get gathering <e> <s> he said lets bring this to an end <e> <s> but he has slowed down the whole process of the bill in a ridiculous fashion <e> <s> if the noble lord would be more abrupt and make his points sharply as is the custom in your lordships chamber we would get on with and complete our business <e> <s> the noble lords slow ponderous way in which he says i must call your attention to this matter is out of keeping with your lordships house if i may be allowed so to say to such an eminent noble lord <e> <s> if only the noble lord would get on with the business we would deal with the scottish bills much more quickly <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will give way to me <e> <s> yes of course i have read the clause but what i am talking about is the slowness with which the noble lord conducts business <e> <s> that does not apply particularly to scottish bills welsh bills or english bills but to the pace at which he handles things which is incredibly boring to other noble lords <e>", "<cs> to answer the noble lord quickly there would be many more members in this chamber at any time of the day if we were not so bored with what came on this subject from the noble lords who debate scottish affairs <e>", "<cs> it need not be <e>", "<cs> it might be the case that in order to make quite certain that the government can provide a satisfactory answer to the noble lord lord ross they have to have that sort of answer because it might prevent his responding to it <e>", "<cs> not yet <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down does he not think that that could have been said in about a third of the time if he had been suitably briefed <e> <s> perhaps the scottish office could receive the type of advice which i have been trying to indicate to the noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord lord underhill aware that some five or six years ago i put forward an amendment on similar lines to this when speaking from the back benches opposite and his noble friend on the front bench i forget who it was said a great deal more succinctly than my noble friend today has just said that whenever secretaries of state exercise powers they always do so reasonably <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e> <s> of course this was a probing amendment and i put forward the excuse that we have had only one intermediate stage as my noble friend lord drumalbyn said earlier because this particular clause came into the bill rather late in the day <e> <s> however the point is that i think my noble friend has answered the main features of what i had to say <e> <s> i hope that in preparing the regulations the government will take carefully into <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord monson knows very well that i am in sympathy with him on most of the points here but i agree with the government amendment as it stands <e> <s> i think that the great advantage of having three years before there is what will in effect be a review is that it will confirm even more strongly that the promoters of the clause were in fact at fault and that the casualty rate will be even more definitely confirmed as being quite unchanged or if anything slightly worse <e> <s> therefore it will be very helpful to us to have the three years evidence with which to shoot down the idea when the time comes <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak briefly in support of the amendment moved by the noble viscount lord simon <e> <s> as my noble friend the minister will recall his reply when i moved a similar amendment at report stage was so frustrating that in desperation i put my amendment to a division <e> <s> in fact this was a very unwise thing to have done and i know that but it was done in an attempt to demonstrate to my noble friend that i cannot understand why the government cannot see the arguments which have been put forward so cogently by the noble viscount on two occasions and which he has now amplified very well <e>", "<cs> yes amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> would it be relevant or may i answer the noble baroness first <e>", "<cs> i have another amendment on which i should be happy to debate the point that the noble lord has just raised but perhaps i could address my remarks briefly if the committee would allow me to the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> the fact of the <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend very much and with that beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me <e>", "<cs> i know it is very unfortunate that the noble lord was not here for second reading but does he not think it would be better if he did not inflict this committee with a second reading speech and instead spoke strictly to the question that clause stand part <e> <s> he has made passing reference to it but the whole of the last few minutes of his speech have been on second reading and have had nothing to do with clause <e>", "<cs> but we have already had these sorts of speeches which we have had an opportunity to give at second reading <e> <s> the noble lord apologised and it was good of him to do so for not being here but i really suggest that it is stretching the bounds of order in this house to make a long and involved speech about general subjects when one really is supposed to be speaking about the clause <e> <s> it may have all sorts of implications but those are dealt with at second reading and not carried on through the committee stage <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble friend on the front bench would agree with me <e>", "<cs> do i gather from this that the noble lord lord mccarthy is suggesting that there should be a levy on all employers in industry to satisfy certain needs which might be narrow dealing with specific areas regardless of whether that has any relation to the efficiency effectiveness or training capability of the particular employers companies <e> <s> or will this be sufficiently narrow for the employers and their companies to benefit <e> <s> can the noble lord explain that <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few remarks <e> <s> the noble lord lord rochester told us that paragraphs ii and iii contained good basic principles <e> <s> with that i would absolutely agree <e> <s> but he did not speak about paragraph i and i am afraid that where i see a flaw in this exposition of very good principles with which i think we should all agree is that it is centralism by the back door <e> <s> my whole experience in this field has been that criteria published by as remote a figure as the minister are extremely difficult to apply at the working end <e> <s> good training must be carried out effectively on the ground with the people concerned <e> <s> the closer the criteria is related to the needs of the company and the people within the company at the working level the more effective it is <e> <s> so if the minister sitting at the top of his ivory tower in whitehall produces the criteria he is almost bound to produce either criteria so frightfully broad that they do not mean very much or criteria if narrower that are irrelevant to the needs of the individual company and the individual people within it <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness very much for letting me intervene <e> <s> the thing i was criticising was not the detail of paragraphs ii and iii <e> <s> it is paragraph i that the minister is going to produce criteria <e> <s> that is what i do not like <e>", "<cs> i remember well back in when my training board which had a levy rate of per cent <e> <s> sought to increase it <e> <s> we started with per cent <e> <s> in order not to be too much of a strain on the smaller companies in particular and to a certain extent the bigger ones because they were getting good grant and were satisfied with that because we wanted to sell ourselves to industry so as to make sure that they listened to us and got the training message <e> <s> on the whole that is the way in which we did it <e> <s> in the employees representatives wanted us to put up our levy to per cent <e> <s> and the employers did not want us to put it up at all <e> <s> in the end the secretary of state had to arbitrate and we ended up with a rate of per cent <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> not at this stage <e> <s> i am afraid that i have always found transferable skills a <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could just add two remarks <e> <s> surely a principle is invoked for companies which have never paid anything towards training boards <e> <s> more recently they have been exempt <e> <s> earlier on they were getting substantially more in grant than they ever paid in levy <e> <s> i would draw the attention of my noble friend to the concluding remarks of my second reading speech at col <e> <s> that is my first point <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount decides what to do about this i think i might say that unlike the noble lord lord mccarthy with whom i find myself almost constantly in disagreement this evening i found there were certain features of what my noble friend said which deserve study and personally i should have preferred to come back to this matter <e>", "<cs> i am reassured by what my noble friend has to say but i do not quite understand when he says that employers have more say <e> <s> can he elucidate that <e> <s> i think paragraph of the explanatory memorandum talks about the present equal balance of employers and employees representatives which is the normal way of deciding it after consultation with the organisation of employers only <e> <s> that does not give them any more power because the relevant part of the act still has an even balance between employers and employees <e> <s> though i think perhaps my amendment goes further than i would have thought and i shall come back to it at another time so long as you have an equal balance the employers really have no more power on money matters than they have had hitherto <e>", "<cs> i shall have pleasure in reading my noble friends speech with great care but i may come <e>", "<cs> i should like to interject because i do not honestly believe that the noble lord need have any fears and that my aims are not achieved <e> <s> the paragraph states <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to congratulate the maiden speakers my noble friends lord thomas of swynnerton and lord orkney and the noble lord lord mayhew <e> <s> i hope that the noble and gallant lord lord carver will forgive me if i do not follow him precisely particularly in the nuclear argument though i shall touch on it as i go <e> <s> there is a great deal to be said and we must try to hurry <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to follow my noble friend as he suggested but i think i can take it that amendment no <e> <s> does not challenge the virtue of the ladies to whom he was referring <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene <e> <s> i do not think that my noble friend has quite got the point of my amendment <e> <s> i am not criticising or seeking to make anything different <e> <s> what i am saying to him in effect is that section of the act as amended has a subsection but it does not have a subsection b <e> <s> the amended act has a section relating to levies and sections a and b which relate to exemption from levies <e> <s> all that i am saying to my noble friend is that i am not querying anything except that section does not have a subsection b <e> <s> it seems to me that it would make more sense and i am sure that this is what the drafters meant if it were to say the provisions of section to b which does make sense within the amended act <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that the answer does not meet the issue that i think is there <e> <s> i do not quite see the point which the noble lord lord mccarthy made about punctuation <e> <s> however perhaps it is just a matter of punctuation <e> <s> i hope that it is possible with the speed with which this bill is being rushed through that the necessary correction can be made to get the english right <e> <s> that is all that i am worried about <e> <s> i accept what my noble friend said about what he thinks the effect would be if the english were right <e> <s> it is very complicated and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend very much for such reassurances as he is able to give me <e> <s> having learned that i am firing my guns in the wrong direction there is no point in furthering this amendment <e> <s> i should have said as my noble friend picked up that i was also talking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i shall hope that in this rather cross-threading type of argument the message will get through to the manpower services commission that people who are not under training boards do not want questions put to them <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should answer that question <e> <s> first the noble lord lord mccarthy did not vote with me because we did not take the amendment to a vote <e>", "<cs> the noble lord did in spirit perhaps <e> <s> i apologise if i have put down an amendment which is not as clear as it should be but amendments nos <e> <s> and were given to me on the advice of the cbi as a package <e> <s> i understood that amendment no <e> <s> was necessary in order to give validity to amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps at the outset i should try to put the mind of the noble lord lord mccarthy at rest and try to persuade him that this amendment is as necessary as no <e> <s> <e> <s> if he looks at the act as amended in particular section which is the one we are seeking to amend he will see it is the employment and training act subsection of which we are seeking to delete as well as subsection which follows from it that it starts <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much appreciate the sense that is behind the production of this amendment <e> <s> indeed sub-paragraphs i <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl but perhaps i should just finish by saying that basically this is a great conundrum <e> <s> if you come to think of it there are very few areas where this sort of thing is being <e>", "<cs>

to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the only difference is the reference in paragraph to paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly say that this is an enabling bill <e> <s> i do not agree with the strictures of the noble lord lord mccarthy at this stage <e> <s> the question is how the government use the enabling bill and perhaps i may leave my noble friend with the thought that industry is very concerned on two points <e> <s> one is money that we have talked about and the other is unnecessary back-seat driving in this general area <e> <s> i hope that in drawing up the orders in due course this concern will be given the fullest possible consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord wolfenden for the way in which he produced this report and for his kindness in asking me to join sub-committee c for the consideration of this draft directive <e> <s> perhaps i may open by reflecting a little on the general subject rather than the particular where i see the particular conundrum being created <e> <s> it seems to me that there is no doubt whatsoever that employees in companies are increasingly wanting more and more information <e> <s> i think everybody recognises that <e> <s> some companies are better than others and some examples have been given <e> <s> it may be that some companies perhaps not very successful companies do not do even as much as a small amount <e> <s> but we are moving in that direction <e> <s> attitudes are changing and it is really quite remarkable how much they have changed in the last years or so in all sorts of areas including this one <e> <s> i think we must not be in too much of a hurry to try to push things along at a rate which is faster than the attitudes are changing <e> <s> by all means let us keep it going and let us keep the momentum up but not go too far too quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> like the noble lord lord walston i should like first to congratulate the noble lord lord cledwyn for his splendid chairmanship of sub-committee d which is a pleasure to enjoy and indeed to be disciplined by and also for the most clear way in which he introduced what is really quite a complicated subject <e> <s> in fact if i might say so no other noble lord has put it so clearly since <e> <s> i should also like to extend my warm congratulations to the noble lord lord mackie for the statesmanlike way in which he presented his case <e> <s> it is so very different from how he presents his case in sub-committee d <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend says no but when he comes to read what he said he will see that that is the sense one got from his remarks <e> <s> i should therefore like reassurance that livestock farmers are ordinary people and just as worthy of receiving all the benefits from article of the treaty of rome as any other sort of farmer <e> <s> if they ate then the report which we are debating will be seen to have more sense to it than was implied by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend my lords and i am glad he has had an opportunity to correct what he said earlier <e> <s> perhaps the minister will now give us the great wisdom he has to contribute to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords before the right reverend prelate sits down would he possibly consider whether the north american indians whose interests he clearly has closely at heart have consulted with the maoris of new zealand who seem to have sorted out their problems a great deal better and whose original position perhaps i might suggest was very similar <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that there are many noble lords who hold a totally different view to that expressed by the noble lord lord jenkins and that in fact the majority of people in this country could be expected at this time to be opposed to his viewpoint <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add my congratulations to my noble friend lord constantine on his maiden speech <e> <s> its brevity was an example to us all and i think that the succinctness of its contents would show that he can probably contribute better to our affairs than many of the rest of us <e>", "<cs> even relatively major alterations to the allocation for dividends and senior salaries throw up very little to benefit the bulk of wages and salaries <e> <s> so extra money can only come from increasing sales relative to the costs of bought-in goods and services that is to increased productivity <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord care to ask me a question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord should ask me a direct question rather than using his intervention as a technique for giving a little extra speech <e> <s> that technique is fine when it is question time but on this occasion he is intervening in somebody elses speech <e> <s> i think that the noble lord is down to speak later is he not <e> <s> that would be an occasion for him to speak or even at the end of the day he can make a speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as advised by the brewers society who under the circumstances welcome this bill if only to make sure that we are not at loggerheads with the eec commission <e> <s> all that they would ask is that the bill has a speedy passage and is not amended <e> <s> in its present form it seems just about right <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to open my remarks by extending my warmest congratulations to my noble friend lord dilhorne <e> <s> humour certainly and perhaps he will let himself go a bit more next time because there is a lot of humour there <e> <s> profundity very much and i trust that my noble friend on the front bench will take some note of what my noble friend lord dilhorne had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am really saying is that it is paying for a licence to which one is taking exception <e> <s> paying for the cost of disposal or paying a reasonable share of the cost of disposal is perfectly reasonable <e> <s> what i am suggesting is that there is no need for the local authority to make its money by collecting money from the licences which is a form of indirect and rather broad-brushed taxation rather than being precise <e> <s> it can probably be very well dealt with by the waste disposal authority itself tackling the problem commercially as has been done by west yorkshire <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord darling <e> <s> i was not quite sure whether south yorkshire was an independent authority these days since it has all changed <e> <s> as to bonding this is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut <e> <s> adequate protection of the environment and restoration is provided in the site licences and modern planning permissions without resorting to bonding <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by offering my congratulations to the noble earl lord winchilsea and nottingham for his splendid maiden speech <e> <s> he probably did not think that what he was saying was controversial but i found it so <e> <s> for all that i hope that we shall hear much from him in the future <e> <s> he spoke most fluently and it was interesting to hear what he had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords before we leave that subject may i say that the skulduggery to which i referred was the fact that the minority report was published before the main report <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed a privilege to speak following the noble lord lord chalfont who made what i thought was a remarkable speech and i was delighted that he found it necessary to change his speech to the one which he in fact made <e> <s> while i appreciate entirely that he cannot expect an answer from the government for the good reason he gave it is a shame that he cannot have an answer <e> <s> i wish also to congratulate my noble friend the duke of norfolk for a very remarkable speech and for taking the splendid initiative of bearding the misguided people of the cnd in their own den <e> <s> that was absolutely first-class of him <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend very much for his full answer would he not agree that something rather more positive and robust as was indicated some three and a half years ago would be appropriate particularly to allay the fears of the people in the falkland islands in whose vicinity this particular place is <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend not agree that there is a need to reassure the people of the falkland islands and could he perhaps give me some pointer on that <e>", "<cs> my lords in what i have to say to your lordships i am advised by the cbi <e> <s> my <e>", "<cs> my lords i gather if i may put it this way that she is so far stillborn <e> <s> the united kingdoms environmental quality objective approach controls all sources of the substance under consideration and hence industry has opposed in these directives a specific reference to discharges from new plant <e> <s> however it has been recognised that if a complete impasse is to be avoided some compromise <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed a privilege to follow the noble lord lord hill-norton in a debate of this sort <e> <s> i hope that i shall not need to detain your lordships too long because he has said so much from the great depth of experience that he has which i would seek to underline <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend lord morris for raising this debate and indeed all those who have spoken who have consistently made this strong point <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend the minister will take particular account of the remarks of the noble lord lord shackleton who i am sure we all felt privileged to hear not so much because of his knowledge and his connections with the part of the world about which we are talking but because of his great stature as a minister in this house and as someone whose views must surely be respected even if those of us who are trying to contribute do not get the same level of respect <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend how the argentinians justify their unauthorised occupation of south thule which is not part of what i believe they call the malvinas islands and many miles away from it <e>", "<cs> my lords can they also operate helicopters <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it true that the import figures are being produced <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that exporters need these figures very importantly in order to be able to penetrate third world markets which are getting increasingly competitive <e> <s> may i ask him to reconsider this point and make a real effort to see whether these figures can be produced <e> <s> i am sure my noble friend is aware that a sample is really not good enough in these circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to raise two further points <e> <s> first my noble friend did not reply to my supplementary question so as to confirm whether the situation will not apply to imports <e> <s> import statistics are being produced are they not <e> <s> if that is so if the government can produce import statistics why can they not produce export statistics <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to my second point surely the argument about not going out to contractors with confidential information is not a very strong one since to my personal knowledge in relation to defence services the government frequently contract out under special rules <e> <s> is what my noble friend has said not an inadequate answer <e> <s> can my noble friend not say that he will look at it again and does he not consider that his right honourable friend has something to look at which perhaps he has not considered in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly to support my noble friend lord ridley and advised by the isle of wight county council i would implore my noble friend lord belstead to consider whether the particular error is not the precipitate nature of bringing this order before this house in view of the fact that the whole matter is to be considered for england in the very near future with the great concern that counties must have that precedent will be set whatever may be said in this particular order <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond immediately to that <e> <s> i am afraid that i had not noticed amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> but amendment no <e> <s> only allows section protection to apply in the case of criminal proceedings <e> <s> the circumstances about which i am talking relate to civil proceedings <e> <s> so amendment no <e> <s> certainly would not do for me in any way and it would be even more important to proceed with amendment no <e> <s> because of any threat of anybody accepting amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> that is a most reassuring remark by my noble friend <e> <s> i would be happy to withdraw my amendment on that basis <e> <s> i look forward to hearing what my noble friend has to tell me in this connection <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish briefly to add a few remarks in response to requests from naval friends of mine who also were in the bag and who have given me substantially the same story as we have already heard from my noble friend lord kimberley and other noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> there are only two points that i feel come out of this <e> <s> first it seems quite clear that money was withheld ostensibly or rather in fact in order to hand it over to the captive powers at a later stage in accordance with the geneva convention and secondly the money was not in fact paid to those powers and was not paid to the people from whom it was withheld in the first instance <e>", "<cs> i suggest we resist this amendment <e> <s> in the first place it is a little illogical without amending clause <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend when considering further stages does not overlook the fact <e>", "<cs> may i suggest to my noble friend even before he lets the siren voices to which he has just been listening sink in that if he were to follow the advice of my noble and learned friend lord renton as endorsed by the noble lord lord hooson he would be casting great distress upon those very people whom in his opening remarks he sought to protect from unreasonable threat from various directions <e> <s> perhaps it is rather better to look to the general wellbeing and morale of public servants than to bother with what is happening across the channel in europe <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to say that i support strongly the principle of this amendment and i hope very much that the government will give it favourable consideration <e>", "<cs> i am slightly confused by this latest interchange between my noble friend lady faithfull and the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> it seems to me that the basic purpose of this amendment is to repeal the act <e> <s> the part i am particularly concerned about i am sure that my noble friend lord elton is aware of this is that it will remove the safeguards that are at present there for various public servants in relation to civil action <e> <s> i have no very strong argument against the modification to the criminal part which it within this amendment but i would have thought it is most undesirable to remove the safeguards that are within section of the act with regard to civil action <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend when he comes to reply will reassure me on that point <e>", "<cs> i am in something of a difficulty and i should very much like some advice <e> <s> as i saw it my amendment no <e> <s> was a separate issue certainly regarding the points i wanted to make from the issues dealt with by the noble lord lord wallace of coslany in his great series of amendments <e> <s> i understand fully why my noble friend lady faithfull in what i thought was a remarkably well-informed contribution naturally moved from lord wallaces subject right across into mine <e> <s> what i should like to know from my noble friend the minister is whether in the interests of the committee he would advise me now to say what i have to say or whether he would like me to hold back until he has dealt with the series of amendments moved by the noble lord lord wallace <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend and i will wait until my turn comes to move my amendment <e>", "<cs> yes indeed there is <e>", "<cs> i am deeply grateful to my noble friend for his very full answer <e> <s> i thought for one awful moment that he was not going to answer the question that i particularly asked him but he did <e> <s> he also answered the question that i was going to ask him next <e> <s> i am reassured in particular that he emphasised the point that the background to this training programme will be in the form of guidelines rather than rigid instruction <e> <s> of course any training programme must have a degree of similarity as between one part of the country and another but the greater the degree to which local authorities do not feel they are being told by central government precisely how to do things the better <e> <s> with that reassurance i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord not taking advantage of our procedures to have the debate on clause stand part all over again all by himself <e> <s> is it entirely in accordance with the sort of feeling of how things should be taken in a committee stage of this house and does the committee agree with this <e> <s> because we have already been over the ground completely <e>", "<cs> there is just one small point about clause <e> <s> clause reads <e>", "<cs> my lords what a wonderful speech to follow with those splendid words at the end <e> <s> i must start by congratulating my noble friend lord mackintosh of halifax whose speech i was fortunate enough just to be able to hear <e> <s> if i may say so it was a speech of great clarity of thought and of delivery and one of which we can all be proud for a maiden speaker <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear much of him in the future <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the statistics were in fact quoted by my noble friend lady trumpington <e> <s> she quoted various groups of questionnaires that had been answered from which it emerged that the figures were i think something like per cent <e> <s> in favour and was it <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> against and that only per cent <e> <s> did not know <e> <s> that is two-thirds roughly <e> <s> or i think there were three sets of figures that my noble friend may have quoted <e> <s> perhaps when she winds up she may be able to clarify this <e> <s> but all sets <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord sefton will forgive me if i return to a debate on my noble friends motion rather than the subject upon which he has been addressing us <e> <s> i am indeed grateful to my noble friend for this debate <e> <s> i think that it is most timely and if i may say so he introduced it with his customary skill <e> <s> i hope he will forgive me and that indeed your lordships will forgive me if i leave before the end of the debate to keep an appointment which i am unable to avoid <e> <s> i hope also that my noble friend lord bellwin will forgive me <e>", "<cs> my lords we must thank the noble lord lord northfield very much for putting down this very timely question <e> <s> this might be an opportunity to say from these benches how much we congratulate him personally on the work that he has done over the years to push along small businesses and their development in all possible ways <e> <s> he has probably done more than anyone else in either house of parliament in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that it would be most irresponsible for the trident project to be abandoned at this point in time <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord rugby is to be congratulated on bringing this bill before us <e> <s> there is a great deal behind what he has said in that reading glasses are what most people require <e> <s> i can tell a story about a canadian admiral friend of mine when i was the naval adviser to the united kingdom high commissioner in ottawa some years ago <e> <s> he was in his mid-s and he went into his office one morning without his specs <e> <s> so he had to borrow his secretarys specs and unfortunately it was at a time when ladies had very ornate specs with great curls up the sides <e> <s> about an hour or so later he was told that the minister wanted to see him <e> <s> he was desperate because he felt that he could not go to see the minister in his secretarys specs <e> <s> on the other hand he could not read without his own <e> <s> so he hastily rang up the medical director-general and said i must have a pair of specs and quickly to which <e>", "<cs> i would rather not because it is a bit late <e> <s> one could go on popping up and down all the time <e> <s> the point is that you have to think how these people are rewarded <e> <s> from what i have heard it seems that the government are extremely mean in what they pay them for such expertise as they demonstrate when they are doing their testing and it is in this area where if we want to have cheaper specs under the <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will remember that at committee stage i did my best to persuade the committee that section was very important and i suppose the best wording on it was in column of the report of the proceedings on the second committee day by my noble friend lord elton who summarised it very well <e> <s> what i find difficult now and i fully appreciate the compromise that the noble lord lord wallace referred to is why indeed he needs to open his amendment by saying section is hereby repealed because he then proceeds to put back first of all subsection and then subsection <e> <s> they are admittedly not precisely as worded that is understandable and i hope there are no hidden nasty points that have been omitted but as i read them they are virtually subsections and <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down will he not agree that as the noble lord lord kilmarnock is in the chamber and the noble lord lord winstanley has joined us we could debate amendment no <e> <s> at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friend lord renton i should like to direct your lordships attention to what he said at col at the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that if we restricted our debates to matters about which we are very fully informed we should have hardly any debates at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord wallace felt that my contribution to his amendment no <e> <s> was unduly critical and hard to understand <e> <s> in fact his amendment to my mind was a very much better one than this one <e> <s> i have always understood it to be the custom if not the rule of the house that one did not put down an amendment at the next stage of the bill identical to the one put down earlier unless there was some over-riding reason <e> <s> the noble lord lord wallace as he clearly put to us when he moved amendment no <e> <s> explained how he had done his best to reach a compromise on the situation as it had come out of committee <e> <s> it does not seem that the noble lord <e> <s> lord hooson and his colleagues have taken that point at all <e> <s> in that sense this amendment is not particularly in accordance with the custom of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it might be <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have a right to speak <e> <s> i have not spoken earlier <e> <s> it has not been wound up <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have the right to speak <e> <s> i wish to say if i may that if it is any consolation to my noble friend i entirely agree with all that he has said <e> <s> i was convinced at report stage at cols <e> <s> to <e> <s> the government have clearly issued all that they should have done both in legislation and instructions <e> <s> they are clearly going to do more to endorse what the house clearly wants them to do and i should think that that is enough to it <e>", "<cs> my lords as on earlier occasions i take a somewhat different view on this matter from my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> i too think the amendment would do very little to change section of the principal act and i find it surprising that it should have been tabled at all <e> <s> i have no real objection to it and it is difficult to see whether there are any hidden differences which an untutored mind cannot uncover <e> <s> i too wonder whether there is any need for <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i should like to endorse what my noble friend lord renton has said and indeed what the right reverend prelate said <e> <s> it seems to me that it would be inappropriate to make this amendment <e> <s> i think it is significant and i should like to thank the noble lord lord winstanley and the other movers of this amendment and the noble lord lord wallace or should i say the noble and ecclesiastical lord lord wallace <e> <s> for having come so far in the direction of accepting that section is not the wicked thing that i think perhaps they thought at the early stages of this bill <e> <s> that in itself i think is a good thing and i hope that in another place they will take it where it stands <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i took would like to thank my noble friend for his courtesy and care in taking this bill through <e> <s> i should like to make only one contribution <e> <s> it is quite clear that noble lords who know a great deal more about this subject than i do feel that not only is it a good bill but that it has been improved by us <e> <s> i am left with a feeling that we have made quite a lot of progress in looking after and improving the general relationships and civil rights if you like of patients <e> <s> however i fear there is a slight risk that we may have gone too far in not looking at the civil rights of the other people involved to which my noble friend lord auckland referred <e> <s> he mentioned the doctors the nurses and the social workers but he did not refer to the relations and i think that they too need to be protected in this very difficult area in which we operate <e> <s> i hope that the government are fully aware i am sure they are of <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that in the long run and in the last resort some of the monies which ought to go to the ex-prisoners of war are being retained by the treasury <e> <s> would it not be sensible to have a solution whereby some of the monies which the treasury have held on to which ought in some way or another to have gone to the ex-prisoners of war are paid into some officers charity of an appropriate type as a gesture by the government that they recognise that it is not proper for the treasury to hold on to monies which they really do not deserve to have <e>", "<cs> my lords we must thank the noble lord lord spens for producing this bill and asking us to debate it for a second reading in order to study this problem <e> <s> unlike the noble baroness lady seear i think it is pejorative to describe all bodies of that sort as quangos and automatically assume they are wrong as a result <e> <s> what is important is that when we have a system or structure which was first set up in the s it is almost essential that we should have a good look at it <e> <s> in many cases it is fair to say that it may well have expended its usefulness and no longer be relevant to the affairs of today <e> <s> things have changed and we need to look at it from that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down was he arguing that he sees the government as spending lots of money employing many more inspectors so that more of these firms which are not quite paying the minimum earnings levels declared by the wages councils should be taken to court and punished for their offences <e> <s> is he therefore saying that he would like those firms to employ fewer people or to go into liquidation and thereby increase the unemployment of the country at large <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend would not find it too difficult to follow up the point made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is it not a fact that individual civil servants get more in the shape of this increment of i think my noble friend said per cent <e> <s> than the amount awarded as an increase and therefore one must always assume that there is another percentage to be added on to whatever is publicised in the newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord renton very much for introducing and indeed for thinking of this splendid debate for doing it so skilfully and for setting the course of the debate so clearly for us <e> <s> i should also like to thank my noble friend lord belstead very much for his introduction and for the many things which the home office has clearly set in train already and is going to set in train as time goes on <e> <s> although many congratulations from various quarters have been expressed to my right honourable friend the home secretary i should have thought that in his unassuming way my noble friend lord belstead in introducing these points might have said but he did not because he is a nice chap that he had had a lot to do with the thinking behind them <e> <s> from the many occasions upon which addresses us we all know of the care with which my noble friend views his job and how carefully he views the points that are made in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i am advised in what i have to say by the cbi who in principle agree that some amendment of this sort is necessary but there are certain aspects of it that they are unhappy about and having heard about the little bird that my noble friend lord sandford has mentioned as to the fact that my noble friend on the front bench may have something to say about it i think i should mention a few of the cbis misgivings before he does so in the hope that they will be reflected in any statement the government have to make <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down would not he agree that large companies are now paying such enormous business rates that anything extra is thoroughly undesirable <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will not stop me now my lords because i have nearly finished and whatever the noble lord wanted to say he will be able to say in a moment <e> <s> it is sad that the first faltering steps in the guidelines towards rescuing the common agricultural policy from becoming the scapegoat of all the ills of the community whether real or imagined seem to have been halted by this years price proposals <e> <s> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will forgive me <e> <s> perhaps on reflection he would agree that i did not say the commission had produced increased prices every year since we joined the community i said that in every year since we joined the community the council of ministers had added to what the commission had produced which is really slightly different <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i am most grateful to the members of the subcommittee and also to those noble lords who are not members of the sub-committee whose contributions have been particularly valuable and enlightening <e> <s> my thanks go also to the many noble lords who made nice remarks about me <e> <s> i do not deserve it <e> <s> but it was very kind of them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords it has often been my position to succeed the noble lord lord brockway in a debate and i have usually found myself arguing strongly against him <e> <s> but on this occasion i find myself almost entirely in agreement and i much applaud the suggestions which he has made <e> <s> on his first suggestion it is extremely important that it is made quite clear that when the peoples of the falkland islands are invited yet again to say where they are there is no question of our being deceived or of other peoples being deceived by the argentinians who happen to be in charge there now in a false way <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend for an assurance with regard to these amendments <e> <s> having looked at the relevant parts of the isle of wight act which are to be repealed as a result of these amendments it seems to me that rather more is being swept away than this bill provides for <e> <s> i should like an assurance from my noble friend that he and his advisers have looked closely into this question to see that they have not in some ways washed out the baby with the bath water <e> <s> i wonder whether he can reassure me that in these local authority sections which are being removed there is nothing substantial which the present bill does not wholly replace <e>", "<cs> my lords in commenting on this bill i speak as a london ratepayer in a small way <e> <s> it so happens that when the fares went down i worked out that my increased rates just about balanced the extra value i would get from my own use of london transport <e> <s> perhaps the situation is now reversed i do not know <e> <s> i have not had time to work it out <e> <s> so your lordships can take it that though a ratepayer i am a neutral one <e>", "<cs> my lords if they go on doing that for any length of time as anybody with experience knows it will cost them the equivalent of p per mile and the aas figures are much higher <e> <s> so i do not think one should take that as a categorical statement about figures <e> <s> as i work it out for the kind of distance that i travel which now costs p instead of p it costs about three times as much to travel by car and about four times as much to use a taxi <e> <s> your lordships may say that because a taxi takes only one person and there are all the other factors related to it that is very reasonable and that it would be better if the differences were six times and eight times <e> <s> but i do not know whether that is a very easy <e>", "<cs> my lords might i intervene before the noble lord moves on <e> <s> it is fractional so far as the individual goods being sold are concerned maybe it is fractional if you can persuade people to take less wages if your company is not doing well that is rare but it is not fractional when you are paying the rates as a commercial ratepayer <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to congratulate the government on the actions they have taken and particularly on the speed with which they assembled the force which is now on its way to the falkland islands <e> <s> whether it is ever used or not is another matter but surely that speed must be convincing to the world in believing that we really mean what we say <e> <s> let us hope we keep that up <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question of the noble lord lord jacques <e> <s> would he not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the question asked by the noble lord lord underhill and indeed the terms in which it is written <e> <s> i should perhaps advise your lordships that i have myself been advised mainly by the cbi on this occasion and my noble friend on the front bench will be surprised to hear that i am giving preference to that advice over the counter-advice given to me by the isle of wight who on the whole hate big lorries whatever size they are but then the isle of wight has only about half a mile of dual carriageway so it is really rather different from anywhere else in the country as i often say to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not have thought that this was a subject which i read into armitage <e> <s> otherwise his main recommendations are not as substantiated as i read them to be <e> <s> probably that is as much as i should reasonably burden your lordships with at this stage because a great many important points were made by the noble lord lord tanlaw with whom i agreed except for his dare i say <e> <s> quango that he was going to set up to manage from the centre all the transport systems in the country <e> <s> i do not think that that sort of body is likely to work any more than other bodies like it have worked <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i understand that but i think that we can leave it as one area in which i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> in other respects i agree with him <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend not only can give an answer today on when he foresees a decision being made if he cannot give an actual decision but i hope he will bear in mind that from industrys point of view not only do we want to know the answer but industry as a whole favours the proposals hopes very much that they will be brought into being and that the gloomy forebodings of lord underhill are not given the priority he would have wished <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the noble and eminent lord lord hill of luton but what he has just been saying has tended to remind me of listening to him on the radio many years ago as he tells us about the ills of government <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend lord bellwin for clearly explaining this bill to us <e> <s> he had a fair amount of flak from every bench since then and i must say the crocodile tears from the benches immediately opposite made me think perhaps i am wrong but has no labour government ever been accused of taking away the autonomy of local government at any time in its career <e> <s> really the government are trying to do what they had to do against the problems of the day and i wish them well in trying to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard that before too <e> <s> i am advised by the cbi and i was delighted to hear my noble friend lord bellwin so clearly recognise the problems of the non-domestic ratepayer when he made his introductory speech <e> <s> it is becoming increasingly acknowledged that business has a strong case for having its rate burden alleviated on many grounds <e> <s> first there have been many problems in recent years such as company closures unused capacity and unemployment due in the main to rising costs and falling profits <e> <s> business rates have contributed to that <e> <s> they have risen as a proportion of real profits from per cent <e> <s> in to over per cent in both figures apply before tax and interest have been paid and exclude north sea activities <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord hawke will not be aware that we have looked at that and the fact is that you cannot give them an effective vote which carries any weight at all so to go hack to that does not solve the problem <e> <s> the main argument against derating is probably cost which would have to be funded by central government <e> <s> however if the finance could not be raised in any other way the subsidy to the domestic ratepayer should be reduced and spread evenly between the domestic and business ratepayer <e> <s> an advantage of that proposal would be that it would he in line with the government policy in reducing business costs and increasing local accountability <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a few words in support of my noble friends bill which was well argued at second reading <e> <s> the same sort of arguments were produced from certain members of the opposition but i am delighted to say not from too many <e> <s> i hope that this bill gets the support that the house has clearly given it through its various stages and i wish it well <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness returns to the charge one thing that seems to come out of this argument is that her concern which i understood though i did not particularly agree with it was with paragraph on page which relates directly to subparagraph <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> i misread it <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord does not mind my intervening i said put it down if <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend the minister replies it would seem to me that this clause is an important one for the benefit of the individual <e> <s> there must be occasions when it would be helpful to somebody to <e>", "<cs> i should like to suggest to the noble lord lord banks that it is a great pity that he has dealt with what are really two quite separate subjects within the one amendment <e> <s> it is possible to see some merit in the but not really in complicating it with the child benefit allowance at the same time <e> <s> i should have thought that this was worth two amendments rather than one <e> <s> but i am persuaded by my noble friend on the front bench that really there is a great deal to be said also as these are minimum amounts to be paid for having a range of them rather than just one because there is the flexibility for employers to increase them if they have private arrangements of their own and they can watch to see that the incentive factor which certainly on this side of the committee we think is important to encourage the individual is retained <e> <s> i should have thought therefore that the range with the reassurance from my noble friend that this is not an actual rate but a minimum rate should be enough to satisfy the noble lord that it really is perhaps better to leave things as they are <e> <s> as for the child benefit matter surely that is better dealt with in another way <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady jeger <e>", "<cs> yes but clever accountants are rather sinister qualified people but ordinary humble people cannot tell <e>", "<cs> i would entirely support the view that to put down a question for written answer would be the solution <e> <s> i would myself put down a question if no one on the benches opposite will do so <e>", "<cs> clause and indeed clause provide for a number of regulations which will be of immense importance to business which now is involved in an enormous amount of administration in this complex area <e> <s> i am asking my noble friends on behalf of business and industry to expedite at least in draft the production of these regulations so that companies can plan well ahead <e> <s> i am told that the autumn is the latest possible time that will be suitable and it would be very helpful if a draft of the regulations could be made available in advance to companies possibly before the summer recess <e> <s> it is no good waiting until christmas <e> <s> i hope my noble friends will take note of this <e>", "<cs> your lordships know that i endeavour to speak with the interests of industry in mind against other attitudes which are adopted in your lordships house <e> <s> but in this particular case i think the noble lord lord banks has been quite extraordinarily generous per cent <e> <s> is as my noble friend said very much more than it could possibly cost as an additional charge on industry <e> <s> i should have thought that the arguments of my noble friend were pretty conclusive because it would be a precedent against the other types of work that industry has to do for the government <e> <s> i do not think it likes doing it but it does it and i think this is another area altogether <e> <s> so i should have thought that this particular amendment suffered from the error of being excessively generous <e> <s> if the noble lord had put in something like per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> i think it would have been more attractive for us to go along with because one does respect the principle <e> <s> it is a great pity it is so generous <e>", "<cs> what an impressive speech we have just heard from the noble lord lord molloy and what a pity to have wasted it just on an amendment in committee <e> <s> on second reading it would have been absolutely ideal <e> <s> we are speaking of one subject yet lord molloy invites us to look broadly and widely at all sorts of sinners and certainly i would not deny that sinners are to be found all over at all levels of society and in all countries <e> <s> with respect however i would remind him that if one restricts oneself to this measure and the issue under discussion one does not want to get on to the wider issues all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a few brief points to make the first of which does not seem to me to have been made in great depth except by the noble lord lord shackleton in his splendid speech <e> <s> my impression is that the government have done surprisingly well over the whole of this operation <e> <s> they have hardly put a finger wrong whether it be in their dealings with the outside world with the security council with other nations with the eec and in everything that they have done to try to get the rule of law effected in the part of the world with which we are concerned or whether it be in the gradual build-up of naval pressure to give that extra impetus <e> <s> i hope very much that they will continue to perform as well as they are performing now <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could clarify it <e> <s> all i am saying is that at the moment we disagree with this the argentines claim the falkland islands <e> <s> so do we <e> <s> after all this is over there will have to be a settlement <e> <s> the united nations could say to them one lot of people who will have no right to a solution will be you the argentinians if you do not obey resolution <e> <s> that might be a way of stopping them <e> <s> this does not mean that we should not therefore go on with article and give paramount importance to the interests of the islanders themselves <e> <s> somewhere down the line though the argentines will have to be in this discussion <e> <s> i am suggesting that if they were threatened by the united nations with nor being allowed to be even in the discussion about whether they had an administrative right there it might make them change their minds <e> <s> it is probably too late and probably they are also too stupid <e> <s> but it would be worth a try <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord lord tanlaw a couple of questions <e> <s> first and this relates to wording is it really necessary to have the words not more than <e> <s> if we had <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might have an answer to my question <e>", "<cs> where does he come from <e> <s> i had not finished my contribution when the noble lord lord beswick intervened <e> <s> what puzzles me is what sort of person are we talking about because we want to understand what the noble lord has in mind <e>", "<cs> so they would have to choose from at least two people in order to have a choice <e> <s> i can see all sorts of difficulties arising here <e> <s> the pension funds are one thing but the directors of a major company are another <e> <s> however i think that i shall leave the matter at this stage <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will allow me to assist <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that the selling of shares to employees is if not as extensive as it should be an established fact it is in existence in private enterprise <e> <s> on the other hand shareholders voted for by the employees is not a practice in private enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised in commenting upon this amendment by the cbi <e> <s> it seems to us as a basic point that these amendments seek to reverse the decison of the government which my noble and learned friend who sits on the woolsack gave in a written answer to a question by my noble friend lord chelwood on th december at column <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this debate and wish to thank our chairman the noble lord lord cledwyn for leading us so well during the preparation of this report <e> <s> it is a great honour to succeed him in the batting order in this debate <e> <s> the only thing that worries me is that he sits on the front bench opposite and i cannot really tackle him because i am in agreement with everything that he has said <e> <s> it is so disappointing <e> <s> i must declare an interest of which i think noble lords will be aware in my being employed within the food processing industry and this will have a slight bearing on what i have to say <e> <s> i hope to concentrate on a fairly narrow front because of the time factor <e>", "<cs> if i may help my noble friend it seems to me despite the honeyed words of the noble lord lord bruce of donington and other spokesmen opposite that bluntly this is a wrecking amendment <e> <s> it is against the principle of the bill it does nothing at all about democracy and i do not think it commends itself to anybody <e> <s> my noble friend made a very good case and that is where the matter should rest <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord bruce of donington will not mind if i defer following him on the parts of his comments which referred to business rates until i come to my own amendments a little later on to which they are totally relevant <e> <s> all i would say now is that the noble lord was quite right when he said that this was a wrecking amendment because of course it is <e> <s> i had a better simile namely that he had harnessed a new set of horses to his coach to drive through the bill and i think that they are much more dangerous horses <e> <s> i really cannot understand how he thinks for one minute that the government will accept the amendment and perhaps the sooner we get over this amendment and get it out of the way the better <e>", "<cs> it is interesting to hear the noble lord lord bruce using section <e>", "<cs> i would in fact find it confusing <e> <s> i do not want to offend my noble friend because i hope he is going to agree but the subject matter of the other amendments is really quite different and they need fighting on their own account <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord would address his remarks to business in local government and not just to local government itself <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may conclude this debate around my amendment because with the greatest possible respect to all sides there has been quite a lot of talk which has had nothing to do with it <e> <s> perhaps noble lords and the noble baroness lady birk will forgive me if i do not respond to her points which i do not think were strictly on the lines of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> with the proviso that if the picture looks right i shall perhaps come back again at report stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend would allow me to bring us back to my amendment <e> <s> the main point is that the paragraph we have sought to remove had interest as the first charge on the revenues <e> <s> my amendment sought to make it even handed between the prinicpal and the interest and that is the only purpose of it <e> <s> this great long political speech all about second reading is no doubt relevant but it is not relevant to my amendment <e>", "<cs> i would take issue with the noble lord on two points <e> <s> first in concentrating on the question of whether or not a business is doing well he has said that rates go up only in proportion to inflation but the fact of the matter is and this is the problem that rates have been going up very much more than that <e> <s> that is exactly what the whole of the bill is about so far as i can guess <e> <s> in certain parts of the country rates have gone up by a considerable amount <e> <s> they might be shown by the accountants in the fixed parts of a firms obligations but in fact <e>", "<cs> perhaps i will be allowed to continue with my speech having given way to the noble lord <e> <s> if he wishes me to give way to him in future perhaps he will not go on for quite so long because it is rather irritating to find that one has forgotten what he said and so one cannot properly reply to him <e> <s> however based on what i do remember of what he said i would say that it is all very well bringing in the domestic ratepayer but everybody is in favour of the domestic ratepayer <e> <s> i am in favour of him because i too pay rates <e> <s> but in fact people do not secure the right balance of the problem of staying in business as a business ratepayer <e> <s> that is what the argument is all about <e> <s> it is a matter of getting that into the right proportion and i suggest that the basis of my amendment is to try to ensure that the matter is dealt with fairly in the future <e>", "<cs> i listened with great care to what my noble friend had to say an i am sorry that his noble friend opposite who i must so describe as he had the same viewpoint lord bruce took the same view <e> <s> i know the arguments against it unfairness difficulty to enforce and all that sort of thing and we should not <e>", "<cs> may i say with a fair amount of experience of the size of committees and bodies of this nature of a public and semi-public nature that i wonder whether the noble lord lord bruce is not going a bit small in his numbers <e> <s> from my experience which is spread over quite a long time i would entirely agree with him that committees of more than members do become unmanageable and when they get up to they can hardly take decisions <e> <s> but generally speaking one has found that the right size for a committee is around the mark because you can usually assume over the years that about one-third of the <e>", "<cs> i should like to intervene before my noble friend on the front bench replies <e> <s> the committee should be indebted to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for raising this subject and exploring it so fully <e> <s> i question his amendments as such the principle at which he is aiming because it seems to me that amendment no <e> <s> c is really cutting out clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to support in principle what the noble lord lord bruce has said and indeed what the noble lord lord lloyd has said <e> <s> it seems to me that what is missing from this clause is an understanding of the attitude of mind of the auditor who is doing the job <e> <s> we have agreed that he should conduct the business which is in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the introduction of the bill by the noble lord lord darling of hillsborough and would like to congratulate him if i may on the comprehensive and convincing way in which he introduced it <e> <s> i should say to your lordships that in speaking to you i am advised on what i have to say by the food and drink administrative council who have an interest of course in aspects of the bill <e> <s> i too agree that there is a real need for the act to be updated in respect of penalties as <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would give way <e> <s> i think he said that he was speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i note that in subsection <e>", "<cs> before i begin to provide some sort of answer to the noble lord lord lovell-davis he opened his speech by referring to remarks made by my noble friend lord strathcona and mount royal when sitting on the other side of the house when the noble lord lord lovell-davis was on the front bench on this side <e> <s> can he further enlighten us and tell us what happened as a result of that speech <e> <s> did the opposition defeat the government and change the clause in question <e>", "<cs> yes i thought he probably did so that rather takes the steam out of the whole thing does it not <e>", "<cs> i must say i entirely agree in principle with the noble lord lord lovell-davis when one is restricting the powers of labour governments <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness lady birk sits down will she confirm that she really said that the distances between airports were getting shorter and shorter <e> <s> the travelling times might be but not the distances surely <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself following the noble lord who has just spoken with a rather different point of view <e> <s> as your lordships are aware i am advised by the cbi and as my noble friend lord avon said we only received these amendments very late in the day <e> <s> i understand the reason for that but we have not had very much time to study them <e> <s> at first sight they appear merely to underpin and re-emphasise powers that are already in the possession of local authorities and to that extent we would not quarrel with them <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness allow me <e> <s> the cbi does not cover only large businesses <e> <s> it covers small ones <e> <s> it has a complete small business section and it is those it is particularly concerned about in this respect <e>", "<cs> may i briefly intervene to say that i sympathise with the general view which the noble lord lord bruce has put forward <e> <s> i hasten to add that i am not an accountant and never will be <e> <s> but i wonder whether looking more closely at the bill he thinks that accountants interests because what he is trying to make sure of is that the accountants concerned get the rate for the job are sufficiently safeguarded by clause under which the commission has to refer to local authorities who in this respect are the employers and to the accounting bodies who in this respect are the trade unions for the accountants <e> <s> i should have thought that that was a reasonable safeguard and the extra wording appears to put on a gloss which is not really necessary as there is quite enough safety written into the clause as it stands <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness and noble lords opposite speak as though requiring instead of requesting is a strange thing in regard to a public body <e> <s> i can remember repeated occasions when sitting on the benches opposite arguing in the same sort of way against the noble lords who sat here at that stage <e> <s> i remember this word coming in other bills promoted in parliament from whatever party in government over many years <e> <s> it is very normal for secretaries of state to retain long-stop powers of this nature and in the end to be able to say do it <e> <s> it does not really deprive people of authority and i very strongly support what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend who moved the amendment will withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to give qualified support to the amendment <e> <s> i am advised on this amendment by the isle of wight county council <e> <s> we would very much have preferred the noble baronesss amendment no <e> <s> at report stage which is like the barnsley one and also

for his support <e> <s> the problem is that we did not have sufficient time to draft this amendment <e> <s> i take the point which has been made by my noble friend the minister that if my amendment were agreeable to your lordships it might have a damaging effect upon the good bit of financing which is being carried on in various ways at the moment <e> <s> a better amendment would have been strike out clause altogether <e> <s> however the government had only just put it in so it was clear that they would not agree to that course and we had to think of another way of getting the message across <e>", "<cs> my lords before addressing your lordships i should make the point that i seem to be the only englishman daring to speak among a crowd of scots <e> <s> however may i remind noble lords that i am half-scots and only one-quarter english <e> <s> my only concern relates to clause about which many other noble lords have spoken <e> <s> in speaking about clause i must declare an interest in that i am employed by two food processing trade associations <e> <s> i am advised on the matter by the food and drink industries council which represents all food and drink matters with

lord stodart whose report was i thought excellent even though half a scot i question the reasons given in paragraph to of his committees report <e> <s> it recommended a shift of responsibility for food standards composition and labelling from regions to districts <e> <s> i would also question as did my noble friend lord drumalbyn whether the stodart committee inquired widely enough from those concerned <e> <s> in appendix a of the evidence there is no mention of evidence being taken from either the food and drink industries council or from the retail consortium <e>", "<cs> there was no evidence at all <e>", "<cs> i could not find any <e> <s> these bodies represent both scottish as well as other united kingdom interests <e> <s> it may be that they should have kept their eyes better

establishment for delinquent girls <e> <s> i shall be talking on a fairly narrow front but i think an important one on which i hope my noble friend the minister can reassure me <e> <s> in passing much of what my adviser has to tell me endorses what my noble friend lady macleod had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> noble lords opposite are spinning this out in a most ridiculous fashion <e> <s> what is more they are saying to my noble friend give us an estimate <e> <s> he has given you an estimate <e> <s> you are then saying give us a factual statement <e> <s> you

pressing my noble friend unreasonably and i can only imagine that it is in order to spin out the time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness would allow me to respond immediately to her and say that noble lords opposite and i am not particularly singling out her noble friend have on this amendment spent a great deal of time in making their basic speeches quite apart from pressing this point <e> <s> it is fantastic how long it has taken <e>", "<cs> my lords there is another side to what my noble friend has been saying <e> <s> i am sorry if i do not entirely agree with him because i so often do <e> <s> the way that clause is worded is that the commission shall publish or otherwise make available its recommendations <e> <s> i will not say that i entirely agree with my noble friend

noble baroness that i am sorry that i do not support her in this amendment because there is nothing to tell the commission what it is to promote studies about <e> <s> it can choose what it makes it studies about <e> <s> what still gets in my gullet though i do not want to go back to the other amendment which was withdrawn is that it must then publish all that it has found out <e> <s> that is different <e> <s> the use of the word shall is part of the normal practice <e> <s> the parliamentary draftsman forces us into that corner so that we get used to the shall and may argument <e> <s> but in this case the subsection does not tell the commission what it has to do in detail <e> <s> it just says that it must do it as a general principle <e> <s> i think that that is perfectly acceptable and i hope that my noble friend will say something similar <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the minister is absolutely right in his argument <e> <s> the wording says <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken even those against me and so briefly <e> <s> it is obvious that the bulk of noble lords who spoke are against me <e> <s> i would ask them and in particular the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran to observe that we are all very distressed at the meat traders who have given rise to this legislation in the first place <e> <s> meat falls into a special category in

potentially guilty <e>", "<cs> i do not think that it is as simple as that but this is not the time or place to pursue the argument <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend lord sandys before

fit something into legislation this subject will have been dealt with in a clearer way <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords for those supplementary remarks <e> <s> there is a serious concern on the part of food processors that they may be unfairly treated <e> <s> i fully accept the points that have been made by all sides <e> <s> i too thought that the arithmetical proportions could be

the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that schedule to the finance act amended the customs and excise management act which so far as i know was not a money bill was this not a practice that in this particular case because it was an administrative matter should not have been followed <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that when this is an administrative matter and does not of itself have relationship to moneys it would be a better practice if all such legislation as that to which he refers were so framed as to be able to be at least amended by both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords does this not protect her majestys customs and excise from the kind of scrutiny to which other departments of state are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to pursue this matter but i have only one or two questions <e> <s> is it not a matter for your lordships house rather than for another place <e> <s> it is your lordships house which has deen deprived of

lord howie of troon <e> <s> much of what i have to say is very similar to what he has said <e> <s> on those closing remarks i am not sure that we want a re-run of that great exposition that the noble lord lord wedderburn and his colleague gave us before <e> <s> still we shall have to wait and see <e>", "<cs> nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to be a contradiction in terms to talk about the freedom of the group <e> <s> freedom is for people <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my voice to those which have thanked my noble friend for his customary courtesy <e> <s> as he knows he turned down the three amendments upon which i was advised by the cbi which tried to make some move in the direction of a fairer distribution of the burden of rates on businesses which perhaps would have made their rates more commensurate with the services rendered to them <e> <s> as my noble friend knows he very kindly gave up time to receive a small delegation from the cbi and myself in order to go into one of the amendments and see whether there was a way through <e> <s> for that we are most grateful <e>", "<cs> to return to the amendment i have tremendous sympathy for what all noble lords have said about the obvious long-term need to get the balance right <e> <s> i am a little suspicious of instant <e>", "<cs> yes i feared that my noble friend might say that but really that is not an answer <e> <s> the kind of people whom we are talking about on being released from prison even if they were put in touch with the local doctor would not have the same approach as your lordships

problem <e> <s> my adviser had this sort of problem <e>", "<cs> i hasten to dispel any opinion that i have been seeking to put through the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> the only point i should like to leave with him on this matter is that having experimented with a girls detention centre in and closed it in because there were to few people to occupy it i understand that sadly the rise in the number of teenage female offenders has been such in the years since that he might well find that it would be wise to consider re-introducing such a place <e> <s>

totally vulnerable when not under some sort of control <e> <s> custody is one thing and we are talking about prisons <e> <s> i cannot but say that because the matter is not going through in the other

which i was advised that there had been difficulties in the past <e> <s> in view of what he has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> rose to call attention to the problems of civil defence and in particular to the duties in this respect of local authorities and to the value of encouraging the recruitment of volunteers to this and other related forms of public service and to move

for his reply <e> <s> it contained excellent arguments against the nonsense that was coming from the benches opposite which i shall talk about in a minute but it was terribly disappointing when it came to the nitty gritty of what real leadership is to be given by the government first in persuading people that they are mistaken in not going on with developing their civil defence and secondly in not undertaking to provide some sort of an argument against the misleading nonsense which is being put forward to the general public of the kind which the noble lords opposite advanced earlier this evening <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in what he said and i will hope to be brief because as your lordships may remember i made most of the points along these lines at second

much before the public eye and since then we have had the labelling directive <e> <s> there are also other directives regarding harmonisation which apply to processed foods which are on the way so

important amendment <e> <s> it happens to us all and it is bad luck when it happens that way <e> <s> i suggest that no doubt naturally noble lords have been speaking for much longer than they need have done on many of the amendments today in order to put their various points <e> <s> i would have said that the whole point on each of them has been quite obvious and therefore the debates on each of the amendments have been much <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to wish this bill well and to say that i trust the government will take note that overdue is a parallel bit of enactment relating to private defences which measure up to the increased penalties which are in the bill <e> <s> i hope we shall not have long to wait before we see some action by the government on that score <e> <s> in the meantime i hope that this bill will be successful <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to open by endorsing the remarks of my noble friend lord glenkinglas in paying a special tribute to all the merchant ships which took part in the falklands operation and of course to those of p o as well <e> <s> it seems an admirable opportunity having a merchant shipping bill even if we do not like it to make those remarks <e> <s> i should also like to thank my noble friend lord lyell for introducing the bill so skilfully in view <e>", "<cs> i noted that my lords but it went over a long period and they handled the signing of it <e> <s> the damage as i see it was done by our negotiators not being tough enough at the negotiating table in those early days when it was first under discussion <e>

thought that experience is now showing particularly as our share of world shipping has dropped quite extensively in those years that our influence is not so great and that we must fight harder to get our way and persuade people <e> <s> the french and germans were mentioned at that time as being countries who had gone along with it <e> <s> we might have done a little more to try to persuade them not to go along with it <e> <s> we might use our membership of the eec now to get a solid eec view against a bulk trade code <e> <s> that is the sort of thing we need to do a little more toughness at the negotiating table not assuming that it will go our way because we were powerful years ago <e>", "<cs> should not the noble lord pay rather more attention to the words of the noble lord lord byers based on his experience and to his comment <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords opposite were not prepared for that and therefore they went on with their arguments <e> <s> but the facts of the matter are first that the private company has to pay its way and secondly and sadly redundancies come from all over <e> <s> at the moment i am involved in trying to improve the pensions of people in the distributive industry training board which i have had the honour to serve for some years who for all sorts of reasons are not getting the pension that they expected because they took a choice assuming that their training board would go on until they retired <e> <s> for different reasons it has not done so and they are now in the position that they chose the wrong sort of pension whereas if the board had gone on they would have chosen the right sort of pension <e> <s> so they are in difficulty and i am afraid that that applies to us all <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may put in one word <e> <s> would my noble friend the minister not agree that if there is a commercial operation it will tend to make the operating more flexible which at the moment i am told by industry is rather lacking and that this would be a tremendous advantage coupled with the various safeguards about which my noble friend has told us <e>", "<cs> may i make a few remarks backing up what my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said earlier which i hope noble lords are not forgetting for we have since had these long statements <e> <s> all this amendment will do will be to complicate things and slow them down <e> <s> the sooner they are dealt with the better <e> <s> they are perfectly legitimate the court of human rights said so in particular cases <e> <s> there are others which are similar but i believe but there are not too many altogether <e> <s> it is right as the noble lord lord houghton has said that publicity for this for individuals is probably undesirable <e> <s> there is no reason why if they themselves want to make it public they should not do so but it should not be forced upon them from without <e> <s> i would have thought it was quite an important point and the sooner it is dealt with fairly and straightforwardly the better <e> <s> as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter pointed out there is ample machinery within the system to make sure that the secretary of state does not abuse his powers in this respect <e> <s> therefore i would have thought that this complicated amendment is better rejected by your lordships <e>", "<cs> why <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest to the extraordinarily long speech made by the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton <e> <s> i have found it so difficult because many of the matters to which he made passing reference were real problems that one has experienced and recognised and i tried terribly hard to relate what he said back to what the amendment and this particular part of the bill are all about but i just could not do it <e>", "<cs> i rise hastily to say that i understood that very well and accordingly i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for saying that the ballot can be held over several days <e> <s> that will be a very useful answer when we come to amendments nos <e> <s> and right at the end of the whole picture <e> <s> i hope that that answer will be repeated then <e> <s> i was hoping that my noble friend would say that the government are aware of the main issue which i am now trying to explain <e> <s> i am not expecting the government to come up with an immediate answer <e> <s> i hate to say it but the noble lord lord mccarthy so well supplemented what i had to say that i hope that the government will read very carefully what he said <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend very much for that generous end to his reply <e> <s> i would make <e>", "<cs> very briefly i should like very strongly to support the amendment of the noble earl lord halsbury and indeed the amendment in principle of the noble lord lord howie of troon <e> <s> the basic principle is all i should like to endorse <e> <s> i speak as a fellow of the institution of electronic and radio engineers and many of my friends in past times particularly when trade union power was riding high in the last parliament when they had tremendous difficulties of conscience as to knowing what best to do steered clear of trade unions perhaps in many cases when they might have wanted to join them for fear of the shackling disciplines that we are arguing about at the moment <e> <s> i do hope that my noble friend will have something positive to say to the noble earl lord halsbury and that if he cannot accept something like these amendments going in now the government will think very seriously about this and perhaps bring something forward on report <e> <s> i hope that will be the result we shall get <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend care to put a copy of the letter that he will be writing to the noble earl lord halsbury and the noble lord lord howie in the <e>", "<cs> what makes the argument of the noble lord lord wedderburn not quite as credible as it should be is that in the background of ones mind is what i call the intimidation factor <e> <s> it is very sad but it is a fact of life that we have had to live with for in my experience the last years that when the pressures come the intimidation comes <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i must say i really think that this is a bit of nonsense <e> <s> the noble lord lord spens knows that i agree with him in many things but if the matter is an important one <e>", "<cs> i should like only to say do not forget the intimidation factor <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies could i ask both the noble lords lord mccarthy and lord wedderburn if either of them have ever taken a case to an industrial court personally <e>", "<cs> i do not mean that they have been a member <e> <s> i ask whether they have taken a case as one of the parties <e>", "<cs> i am not talking as a lawyer am talking as a person who has taken a case to an industrial tribunal <e> <s> i just wondered whether either of the noble lords had ever done that <e>", "<cs> because they would then perhaps be talking from experience rather than theory <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord lord mccarthy has been describing would happen anyway even without his amendment so there is no need for his amendment <e>", "<cs> i sympathise greatly with the point made by the noble lord lord davies of leek and absolutely agree that it would be much better if those cars were not there <e> <s> one experiences just the same difficulty coming out of our car park when tourists are blocking ones vision <e> <s> in a sense they too are parked in a dangerous place <e> <s> so where do you draw the line <e> <s> you have to be just as careful poking your nose out with cars parked there as you do when you have to poke your nose out through the tourists <e> <s> therefore i should have thought that the noble lords example is one of those not very clear-cut cases <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would just let me speak before he starts <e>", "<cs> i think it would have been more relevant if i had spoken before the noble lord gave us his pattern of history because i was going to ask him how that was relevant to clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> let me try to clarify the matter <e> <s> what we are talking about is discouraging bullying <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy may want to hold his hands up in horror at that but that it is what it is all about and what my noble friend was talking about <e> <s> these problems arise only when people have power that perhaps they should not have when a trade union official of whatever sort with a trade union behind him can in certain circumstances exercise pressure on the individual who does not have that sort of support <e> <s> it is perfectly easy for that official to avoid getting joined as my noble friend said by not taking any action in this area except perhaps by saying to other people that he would like something done <e> <s> but he as an individual does not have to do anything <e> <s> so this provision is a discouragement against bullying <e> <s> there are other parts of the bill which are a discouragement against bullying by employers and i believe that as we work our way through it we shall find that the bill is quite well balanced <e> <s> we can go into detail on this and that sort of point but if we keep at the back of our minds that what we want to do is avoid making it easy for people to bully we shall get matters in better perspective <e>", "<cs> before we move on and while we are still considering the clause i should like to ask the noble lord lord mccarthy to clarify a point that he mentioned earlier <e> <s> he was speaking very quickly in answering the debate on amendment no <e> <s> but he quoted another country i think it was sweden and referred to a strange currency with which i am not familiar since i do not travel to that country <e> <s> as i understood it the country placed a limit on joinders for individuals <e> <s> is that right <e> <s> if it is so it seems therefore that that country which i know noble lords opposite admire greatly in terms of industrial relations has joinders for individuals <e> <s> therefore perhaps there is more to this clause than we might otherwise have thought <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord bishopston did not think that my laugh was a catcall <e> <s> i am advised in what i have to say by the united kingdom agricultural supply trade association <e> <s> i am going to talk only about regulation which as my noble friend told us will lead to further regulations <e> <s> we are concerned that the further regulations should not demand any more of the compounders than at the moment they provide and happily provide by way of information to their customers <e> <s> we are particularly concerned that the optional factor in the directive with regard to the declaration of ingredients should remain optional and that there should be no threat in these further regulations of any compulsion with regard to declaration of ingredients or indeed of compulsion with regard to how the ingredients might be presented on any labelling <e> <s> the point about this very briefly is that too tight a control which is not now required can lead only to lack of flexibility which in turn can lead only to increased costs and increased costs will be to the detriment of the livestock farmers whom i understand are very satisfied with the present arrangements <e> <s> we are not talking about petfoods and the regulations in relation to those we are talking only about the supply of feeding stuffs to farmers who are perfectly capable of making their own arrangements to see that they get the sort of feed which they want and for which the current practices are satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down could he reassure me on two points <e> <s> can he reassure me that when his honourable friend mrs fenner has her meeting with the nfu the nfu delegation will include representatives of livestock farmers <e> <s> secondly can he reassure me that at the same time she will be meeting representatives of compounders <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be possible for my noble friend to suggest to the nfu that in this case it is very important that the livestock farmers should be represented <e>", "<cs> my name is on this amendment <e> <s> perhaps i might have a turn to speak <e> <s> perhaps also on behalf of my noble friend i may say something by way of riposte if that is the word to the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> i am surprised at lord mccarthys approach to this problem <e> <s> of course it meant that he could make a much longer speech and i could not understand that either <e> <s> but i am surprised that he professed not to understand at the beginning whereas the basic principle of what it is all about is very clear indeed in saying that he could not understand he then gave us some very good hints as to how this amendment might be tidied up to be rather better in practical terms and i am grateful to him for that <e> <s> as for saying that he did not understand subsection well this must be the clearest part of the whole thing <e> <s> the whole thing to my mind is very clearly written <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with this as the noble lord lord rochester indicated in that i sat with sub-committee c when they were tackling this sort of problem <e> <s> it is a most ingenious way of injecting this thought into the minds of people by using the company report as one way of doing it <e> <s> i am not sure on the other hand and i do not want to disappoint the noble lord lord rochester that we are quite ready for this <e> <s> it is important that it should be in peoples minds that we should work in this way but we are in an area of attitude changing where if you put <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord ferrers for that small crumb of hope <e> <s> i shall look forward to hearing from him <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i too am concerned about this matter because one has met it in many other areas <e> <s> i do not question the sincerity of my noble friend lord bellwin in saying what the government mean and do not intend to happen in the sense that they have no intention of upsetting the situation and that the industrialist of whatever type he might be is not a target for anything <e> <s> the difficulty is that the licensing authority in this case and other local authority bodies like planning authorities do not seem to me to be shackled in the way in which one would like <e> <s> if there were something written into the statute which put some type of restraint upon them or if my noble friend could quote another statute which puts restraint upon them other than the good intention remarks then it would help tremendously to set our minds at rest <e> <s> if my noble friend cannot do that because it does not exist or because it will take time to find it then perhaps he could undertake to look at this again before turning down the basic theme of what my noble friend lord lucas is putting across in his amendment <e> <s> however one wants to have something rather more underpinning than just good intentions <e>", "<cs> could we be told what the grouping is then we would know what is puzzling us <e>", "<cs> surely my noble friend must now tell us whether he likes this <e> <s> i do not see why we should be dragooned just because from the opposition front bench they tell us that this is the way we have got to do it <e>", "<cs> i have no wish whatsoever to withdraw my remarks on this particular occasion <e>", "<cs> i should just like to add briefly that there is much too much that has been claimed for the clamp in clearing the streets and much too much has been claimed for its disadvantages <e> <s> i see it as not being something that we should have in this clause because it is clear to me from the earlier debates that the government have not had time to think it out and therefore the clause itself is being accelerated too fast <e> <s> it is something which the government should think about and introduce in later legislation <e> <s> we have had a transport bill pretty well once a year for the last three years so there will be one coming along and the government can catch up <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend <e> <s> i spoke at length on second reading and at committee stage and i shall not trouble your lordship with repeating all that i had to say <e> <s> it seems to me that one can but endorse what my noble friend said <e> <s> this is a clear-cut position in which the stodart committee and i hope that my noble friend lord stodart will agree now appear not to have been as fully informed about all aspects of it as have later come to light as i brought to your lordships attention principally at second reading <e> <s> it would seem therefore that my noble friends suggestion that if the government cannot accept that the <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down would he not agree that he took no evidence from the food manufacturers organisations who could have clarified for him the misapprehensions i have just heard him giving us in his speech <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend lord lyell though i am not sure that i thank my noble friend lord inchcape for his rather heavy-gunned attack on my amendment <e> <s> he suggested that the secretary of state would use his common sense <e> <s> well without mentioning any names it has not been my experience that secretaries of state use much common sense <e> <s> however i see the point made by my noble friend and indeed by both my noble friends <e> <s> i shall certainly take away and read with great care what my noble friend lord lyell has said and i reserve the right to come back on report <e> <s> but before i sit down i should like to thank my noble friend lord lyell very much for his helpful letter in response to the points that i raised on second reading which of course has been passed on to the appropriate people <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly add a bit of technical interest <e> <s> as an ex-naval signals officer who did some time in a research establishment in liaison between the navy and its scientists i can assure your lordships that what the noble lord lord underhill was saying about the possible interference between radio transmitters and radar sets is very real <e> <s> therefore i very much back up paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i look forward to seeing his amendment at the next stage and have pleasure in withdrawing the amendment <e>", "<cs> really my lords the blandishments of the noble lord lord mishcon beggar imagination <e> <s> i am sorry to say to my noble friend lady faithfull that having had my eyes directed by my noble friend the minister to clause it seems to me to be totally comprehensive <e> <s> if a magistrates clerk is not going to have full knowledge of what is in this particular act when it becomes an act he is more likely to look at clause than at a hidden little part of a subsection in clause <e> <s> therefore it is probably just as well that clause is so very comprehensive <e> <s> i should have thought that my noble friend the minister won his case <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend the leader of the house not agree as regards those county councils who are backward because they have been misled into concentrating civil defence in the nuclear area that it would be in the interests of the country if the government were to emphasise to them the very definition which my noble friend gave in answer to this question to point out to them that they really are barking up the wrong tree and that it is time they got away from this type of mythical position that they have adopted and became practical in the interests of all the people in the country including their own ratepayers <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble and learned friend saying that what he is trying to do is to put right the complications of the criminal law act which presumably was passed by your lordships house when the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones was lord chancellor so he is therefore trying to straighten out what went wrong before <e>", "<cs> my lords i am no farmer but i have gazed through schedule and i find no logic in the maximum penalties newly allocated for various offences <e> <s> therefore its seems to me that the government can readily agree to this amendment without being inconsistent with the other factors in schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords if i could perhaps strike not quite so happy a note in view of the history that my noble friend gave us why is this coming forward as an amendment at report stage instead of being part of the original bill <e> <s> it seems quite extraordinary <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like

amendment he made mention of my contribution to the debate in the early hours of the morning <e> <s> he was kind enough to say that i had talked rather more deeply about the philosophy of it <e> <s> i still think that it is a desirable attitude-changing thing <e> <s> i said also at that time that to use the directors report was an ingenious way of getting it into the system but that i wanted to reflect upon it <e> <s> i think i said at that time and i say it again that what the noble lord has put into subsection is much too detailed <e> <s> subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to reassure him that at no stage was i trying to indicate that there was any trickery on his part or that of his noble friends in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene to

started that already <e> <s> as they are organised at the moment they would have the same sort of problem <e> <s> all they are asking is that the government shall delay the introduction of these clauses sufficiently to give them time to complete their reorganisation <e> <s> what they have been asking for is five years and what i have been seeking in various amendments is that period <e> <s>

i just briefly say that i may have got it wrong but when the noble lord lord wedderburn introduced amendment no <e> <s> and the ones that went with it i think he said in passing that the list of acts of parliament which is now in amendment no <e> <s> is not comprehensive he had not had time to cover all the ground <e> <s> it seems to me that if there is any validity in the argument of the noble lords opposite and i am fairly convinced by my noble friends on these benches not to mention the argument of my noble and learned friend the lord advocate which he produced on the last amendment that they have a point it is surely very sloppy legislation if it is incomplete <e> <s> i should have thought that the amendment ought to be rejected on the grounds that it is not proper if that is the case <e> <s> therefore we are wasting our time in arguing about it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might speak on behalf of the motorists who have been found guilty of speeding and had to pay fines <e> <s> that is a view not expressed all my very respectable noble colleagues who sit on the bench perhaps have a different view <e> <s> i would suggest one particular point <e> <s> it is assumed that if there is no variation of penalty the constable has made the right judgment in not offering the fixed penalty in the first place <e> <s> well our police are jolly good but they are not always right <e> <s> it could be that when the magistrates come to assess the situation they will say in this case it ought to have been a fixed penalty because it should have been a two points rather than a three point case <e> <s> it would seem to me that is much fairer to the ordinary person than making it sure if he is put before the magistrates that it is three points or nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful to my noble friend the minister for having so carefully and fully covered the points which we were trying to make <e> <s> i was slightly concerned when he indicated that there might he within these regulations permission for a visor to be used by day but not by night <e> <s> may i warn him against that because it will be frightfully difficult for somebody to be expected to change over visors at sunset <e> <s> how are the police to know and is it to be sunset nautical twilight or some other time <e> <s> so perhaps i may suggest to my noble friend that different daytime and night time use is something that he should steer clear of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend the minister for going some way towards what i asked for when we discussed this point at the committee stage <e> <s> i think as do many noble lords that he has not gone far enough <e> <s> it is one thing to get type approval but it is spelled out perhaps rather too lengthily in lord underhills amendment and it is not good enough <e> <s> we must have operating standards training maintenance and calibration particularly in this area <e> <s> the secretary of state must go further than just to approve the type because the type takes us only a short part of the way <e> <s> it has been spelled out much more fully by the noble lord lord underhill and by my noble friend lord lucas <e> <s> i hope very much that my noble friend the minister will pay due attention to this and perhaps come back to us at a later stage filling in the gaps on the staff point and what is going in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might say to my noble friend that i am a little unhappy about the word type <e> <s> in the navy for example radio transmitters are called types <e> <s> we used to talk about the type they probably have more modern ones now <e> <s> the type was approved as a type for introduction into the naval service <e> <s> i had a small hand in that happening <e> <s> but it did not mean to say that every type radio transmitter was effective all the time they broke down and had to be repaired <e> <s> therefore the use of the word type as i believe the noble lord lord mishcon indicated is not wholly satisfactory in meeting the requirement that the particular equipment in use at the time should be effective and as proposed in the amendment up to the standard required <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend turns to another matter perhaps i can ask him one question <e> <s> he said that each piece of equipment will have a certificate <e> <s> who will issue the certificate <e> <s> will it be given by my noble friends scientists <e> <s> will they look at all the equipment <e> <s> or will it be given by the makers and so be taken for granted that it will go on working properly <e>", "<cs> my lords i too do not really support this amendment <e> <s> i would hope that my noble friend would be able to assure me that when the device is of a type approved by the secretary of state that will automatically include operating instructions going with it because one would imagine that they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i should start by telling your lordships that i am advised on what i have to say by the food and drink industries council and furthermore i declare an interest in that i work for two of the trade associations that form part of that council the cocoa chocolate and confectionary alliance and the cake and biscuit alliance <e> <s> my main remarks will be concerned with the problems of the food and drink manufacturing industries

soviet nuclear disarmament in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend a brief question in relation to <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend moves on from that he did not really take my point about an emergency <e> <s> i was not thinking of people out of the country and dying where arrangements could be made more of less in slow time but if a patient really

nominated as alternative to the other person <e> <s> if they are both not available is it conceived by the government that it should be possible to further nominate to deal with an immediate problem

noble friend for those remarks particularly the closing ones because it seems to me that it would be intolerable if we felt in our wisdom that we ought to make this amendment that we should be hampered by the thought that procedure might get in the way <e> <s> i appreciate what was said by the noble lord lord wallace with his great experience of another place but i really do think that if we feel we ought to have my amendment in the bill to adjust it to a better balance then we should say so and i am delighted that my noble friend has said that though he does not want that procedure is not the hampering factor <e>", "<cs> my lords in the complications of amendments nos <e> <s> and a and so on i did not thank my noble friend which i now do for having reassured me on one point where the specific requirement within the bill for obtaining medical opinion has been struck out <e> <s> he mentioned one of the amendments to which that referred <e> <s> it is also struck out by amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords consequential perhaps but do i not understand that my noble friend is talking to nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> he is not going that far yet <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i

amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend can reassure me that what he said about other persons on amendment no <e> <s> applies equally in those places <e>", "<cs> my lords would not my noble friend agree that japan in particular is being very onesided in its pursuit of free trade that there are various areas in which japan could give concessions to us which at the moment it does not and that this might be encouraged in the gatt discussions which are shortly to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord rochdale for initiating this debate which is of considerable importance <e> <s> i think it is sad that we had to take our place second in the queue and find ourselves speaking late with relatively few people about the more

that he makes more speeches of that sort to us so that the house as a whole can have the benefit of hearing his splendid form of address <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord

important engagement which will involve among other things drinking whisky i shall however stay as long as i can <e> <s> i apologise in particular to my noble friend on the front bench whose reply i may not fully hear <e> <s> the point i want to re-emphasise because much of the ground has been covered by both earlier speakers is the fact that per cent <e> <s> of scotch whisky is exported <e> <s>

today programme on the whole has a reputation quite as much for entertaining as for informing <e> <s> would he agree that there have been cases where on the whole frivolous aspects of the affairs of parliament have been conveyed to a rather greater extent than one would hope <e> <s> as clause of the charter says <e>", "<cs> my lords unless the noble lord was going to ask a question of the noble lord who has just sat down i think that he is out of order <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may address your lordships very briefly <e> <s> my particular reason for doing so is because i misjudged the business of the house in october of last year and so missed being here for the essential vote on my noble friends amendment which was lost for the lack of one vote and i should like to congratulate her very much on returning to the charge <e> <s> i should also like to make the point which many other noble lords have already made but which i am afraid i must make again that at the time i wished to cast that vote in the direction which would have put this provision into the bill it was because i was so appalled as i had tried to say to the government for six months that they had made public that they were going to do away with endurance because it seemed to me exactly as my noble friend lord buxton has just said that the messages going across the atlantic would give the argentines the wrong impression <e> <s> but i must confess that i never thought that they would be stupid enough to act when they did <e> <s> i did not think it would happen <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend lord avon not agree that three times have the people of essex won their campaign and three times has this come back again that they have amply conveyed their opinions publicly and that it is time this

going for some time and we really have reached the stage when we must have properly trained people <e> <s> i would suggest to my noble friend that although that may appear to be an added expense it

that he would be able to respond sympathetically to my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow for an excellent report and i agree with the noble lord lord rhodes that it is one of the best the select committee has produced in recent times <e> <s> i wish to begin by quoting <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for his very full answer would he not agree that the difficulties within the european community to which he referred

applied to those processed foods <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow up the answer to my supplementary <e> <s> would my noble friend give a rather firmer assurance of the governments intention with

him putting his sound common sense to the assistance of the government <e> <s> but on the other hand it may be that he might be able to speak more freely than when shackled by the cares of office and

was an excellent report so far as it went <e> <s> if i have a criticism of it in itself it is perhaps that it is written in some respects in too landlubberly a way <e> <s> as i shall say later it is

dedication of all the civilians supporting the operation both at home and at sea with the task force <e> <s> they really did splendidly <e>", "<cs> my lords i find this bill an interesting one because it is one which has been written about by almost more people than any other similar sort of legislation raising so many small detailed queries comments and criticisms <e> <s> the larger organisations

"<cs> i am indeed grateful to my noble and learned friend and i am very willing to leave it to him to tidy it up and get across in the bill the point that <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of

misgivings about the advisory committee in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the purpose of the advisory committee that i suggest in amendment no <e> <s> a is almost entirely to deal with the setting up of

to establish the machinery for that register and for being able to determine the situation when experts in this field come to him and say i cannot do this or i can do that <e> <s> he needs somebody to turn to to ask whether the expert is talking sense oris he trying to bamboozle me <e> <s> or even does he know what he is talking about <e> <s> when it starts off he will need all such information

i do not think that it will be anything other than technical information <e> <s> it must not be operational <e>", "<cs> for the purpose of the record i referred to a possible clash between the advisory committee and the experts on the tribunal <e>", "<cs> if i may comment briefly on what my noble friend the minister had to say about my amendment i accept his point about the expertise of the staff of the registrar <e> <s> i think that that is going to be difficult to keep up to scratch all the time one hires a lot of people <e> <s> the noble lord told us at second reading that we are only going to have <e> <s> i have always been a little suspicious about that being enough because there will have to be administrative staff as well as experts <e> <s> so i hope that he will bear in mind the fact that it may be necessary for purely technical reasons and not operational ones to fall back on some technicians <e>", "<cs> may i just briefly support my noble friend and say that in my experience the treasury is not suitable as a department of state to undertake administrative functions of this nature <e> <s> executive responsibility is not its forte and though i well see what the noble and learned lord is working at to try to take this out of some sort of central control there must be somebody there <e> <s> if we were to try to select the department of state most unsuitable to

do much better than we used to be able to do by hand <e> <s> they have lots of paper and addresses and it is quite normal <e> <s> that particular point is perhaps not as pressing when one assumes for the sake of argument <e> <s> that the register is going to be kept on a computer <e> <s> with that i beg leave withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> with no connection to the fact that the noble lord lord wigoder disagreed with my amendment because it would not have fitted his may i say while accepting his point that there is a lot to be said for having somebody who is responsible for compliance with

else and somebody with quite different qualifications <e>", "<cs> i take the force of my noble friends remarks and i would make only one point in reply to him at this stage <e> <s> he said something

not my amendment was accepted <e> <s> so that argument itself does not cut all that amount of ice <e> <s> i noticed that among the european countries that my noble friend mentioned he did not include

singularly unhelpful <e> <s> i was not without personal experience of this whole area at one time in my life and i know very well what he is talking about <e> <s> it was disappointing to find that the

one of your lordships by himself to produce an amendment of any complexity which does not in the end have to be corrected by the government <e> <s> if one thinks about my noble friends speech at least three-quarters of it was a sort of nit-picking criticism which is not really appropriate to an amendment of this sort <e>", "<cs> my lords for once i have to make an unqualified objection to this

qualification <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i too have the same misgivings as the noble lord lord mishcon on this point <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will give careful thought to it with a view to

before addressing your lordships i consulted the cbi and will give you as briefly as i may industrys view of the matter that is the subject of this question <e> <s> the noble lord lord ashby has explained well the basis of the question and the noble lord lord flowers has enlarged on most of the more important points <e> <s> i shall turn my attention to one or two particular administrative points upon which industry has a strong view <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly support my noble friend on one point which i believe is also significant <e> <s> it is my experience that where one has tight terms of reference for anybody and particularly someone in a new function one limits him in the areas one has not covered <e> <s> i should have thought that above everything in this bill and we are dealing with a new subject a new area on which administration is very much open to change as experience is gained it is particularly unwise to put ourselves into a position where the registrar might be constrained not to use his initiative in areas because they are not in this list but where experience may show it to be necessary <e> <s> i should have thought that in addition to the points made by my noble friend on the front bench those are factors which the movers of the amendment might well consider before they take any further action <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely support the amendment as described by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> it seems to me that it is consonant with my original amendment at committee stage which sought to place some sort of checking authority upon officials handling this information and which at report stage i narrowed to consider just those that are covered by clause <e> <s> i have withdrawn my opposition to safeguarding us against hidden manipulation under clause because i see that it is very difficult to put that into effect <e> <s> but here i am heartened by the fact that the noble lord lord mishcon says he is quite open as to who

with clause were going to get out from under being supervised <e> <s> that i strongly think is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not entirely agree with my noble friend lord swinfen in his last remarks

kindly continues to explore with the cbi and others <e> <s> i should have thought that it was a way of limiting <e> <s> indeed amendment no <e> <s> sought to go further <e> <s> but for all the reasons that i shall not repeat now including the experience on the continent of running these same systems one needs to limit the register to a practicable size <e> <s> i should have thought that my noble friends amendment was one way of doing that and that it needs to be considered under the general heading of where is the unicorn <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it encouraging that my noble friend has thought about it which is what i had in mind when i intervened last time this amendment came forward <e> <s> i find myself pretty nearly convinced by the argument <e> <s> there are a lot of bills where it is not laid down specifically that it is two years <e> <s> two years seems an awfully long time <e> <s> there are quite a lot of bills where the minister can introduce certain stages when it seems to be the appropriate moment <e> <s> perhaps two years is right and of course it has the great advantage that everybody knows where they stand and it would be confusing for data users not to know where they stood <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble and learned friend who sits on the woolsack and both of my noble friends on the front bench for their great courtesies to me <e> <s> i should also like to thank them for having accepted so very many amendments if not in their original form especially at the report stage for passing on various amendments which they have not been able to resolve for consideration in another place and for continuing the dialogue on several of the amendments with the bodies concerned which are most interested in them <e>", "<cs> my lords i would suggest that the noble lord might draw his comments to a close <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill opened by saying that some of us might not see the point of his amendment <e>

underline what my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has said and in a sense to answer the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i do not think that noble lords and certainly the noble lord lord tordoff have paid sufficient attention to the many occasions when this house has believed that the government were wrong and have defeated the government <e> <s> this is not entirely due to the number of noble

are many examples of that and i think that perhaps a significant vote which is very relevant to this particular aspect was on the very last division which we had on third reading when the figures were i believe to <e> <s> that i would suggest to noble lords opposite was not so much because there was strength on this side but because there was an absence on their side and that absence could be cross-benchers liberals social democrats or labour supporters <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may answer that question before i sit down i would say how about looking at the <e> <s> there were not all that number on the benches opposite <e> <s> furthermore noble lords on the benches opposite normally produce on these occasions if they are important for themselves alone let alone the other minor parties and the cross-benchers votes of and <e> <s> that is what is significant my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting to follow the noble lord lord jenkins of putney <e> <s> i think i have more in common with him than with even my noble friend lord ferrier because not only was i not on the select committee but i did not even attend the meeting of it <e> <s> i think the same applied to the noble lord <e> <s> i also find myself very much in agreement with the imaginative ideas that he put forward and i only wish he had limited his address to broadcasting matters instead of referring to some of the things on which we violently disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords three main reasons were advanced by the noble lord lord harris who is to be congratulated for bringing this matter before the house <e> <s> the first was that it would make for greater efficiency and we have just heard from my noble friend lady plan some interesting figures including essex county councils experience of having only per cent <e> <s> of their manual employees remaining who are paid weekly in cash and how much that costs <e> <s> i understand from the cbi that in britain per cent <e> <s> of employees are paid in cash weekly whereas in germany france and australia which are among our major competitors it is only per cent <e> <s> and in the united states it is only per cent <e> <s> that is an indication that this change must happen and i think that all who have spoken so far including the noble lord lord rochester would agree that it is only a question of how to go about achieving it <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i briefly give my support to the bill <e> <s> i support it not only because i have had experience of these matters but also because it is such an obviously necessary new move <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise in opening both to my noble friend lord bellwin and to the noble baroness lady birk for having missed their opening speeches owing to another commitment elsewhere in the house at the same time <e> <s> i trust that i shall not offend them by what i have to say having missed their obviously splendid words <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend lord bellwin for the exchange of correspondence that we had and to which i shall later refer <e> <s> as he will be aware i am concerned only about clause as indeed are most other noble lords and its effects on charitable housing associations and trusts in the isle of wight which narrows it even more <e> <s> however although practically everybody else who has spoken has been against clause as a whole and

should like to say one word in support of what he said at committee <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support my noble friend lady trumpington <e> <s> the key issue which we must not forget is that the object of this bill is to give the water authorities a chance to work in a commercial way so that they will have the ability to make their decisions sensibly without all the troubles that happen when there are all sorts of other bodies looking over your shoulder which you have to bother about <e> <s> i should have thought that this amendment was unnecessary and i rather thought that in introducing it the noble lord lord hemingford indicated that because it is taken care of by the governments own clause which we are talking about and also by their thoughts on the guidelines which they will give referred to in answer to a parliamentary question of my noble friend lady trumpington <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might take up a point made by my noble friend lord sandford

is a most heartening move on the part of the commission to have taken a firm line so differently from earlier years whatever are the other implications and that this is something that we should welcome with open arms <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for a lot of what he said <e> <s> i take note of what he said about an area of outstanding natural beauty which of course the isle of wight is <e> <s> i am not however entirely happy <e> <s> i shall not press the amendment at this stage <e> <s> i shall seek to find another means of producing a circumstance which provides some way of appealing without all the expense of going to court <e> <s> it will always be possible to go to court in doubtful situations <e> <s> as my noble friend lord strathcona and mount royal has already stated that is all very well but the people who run these organisations do not like to do that sort of thing to tenants <e> <s> nor do voluntarily-run charitable organisations wish to risk the great expenditure that is always involved in taking a matter to court <e> <s> it is always a dilemma that there is nothing to which one can appeal where there are grey areas <e>", "<cs> my lords as always i was impressed by the contribution of the noble lord lord ezra but he made the point about the opportunity for local authorities to exercise initiative <e> <s> as i read the amendment it is not about initiative it is about the production of electricity <e> <s> i should have thought that local authorities should be encouraged to use their initiative if this is a good way of disposing of their waste <e> <s> but it is good that having taken the initiative they should go to a private enterprise which inevitably and always looks carefully at whether the particular operation will be cost-effective because that is what they are in business for and they go out of business if they are not cost-effective <e> <s> they will get a much better deal from somebody who tackles this problem properly for as my noble friend lord lauderdale has said because local authorities do not really have the same type of disciplines for balancing their books as does private enterprise there is a tendency for them to embark on projects that perhaps are not profitable <e> <s> this would be bad because the whole exercise would be a disaster as indeed my noble friend lady gardner has indicated is the case as regards the edmonton exercise of the same sort <e>", "<cs> my lords we are privileged to have had a speech from the noble viscount lord buckmaster with his great knowledge of the islamic world as a whole as well as the middle east in particular and indeed for the heartening remarks he made which are encouraging <e> <s> i should like to thank very much my noble friend lord cathcart for thinking of this debate and for introducing it so skilfully and comprehensively <e> <s> i think we all owe him a debt <e> <s> i will trust not to keep your lordships too long because time is getting on but there are one or two things i feel that i must say in view of what other people have said <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble baroness was asking me a question but she went on to make a speech <e> <s> if i may turn it into a question the answer is that so long as the soviets take the very false line that they do and have done for years or more it is extremely important to get them in the right proportion <e> <s> i quite see what the noble baroness is saying and my answer to her is yes certainly we should do what we can to help i said that earlier but for heavens sake do not let us blind ourselves to the falsehoods of the soviets <e> <s> we must not blind ourselves <e>", "<cs> as a fellow of the institution of electronic and radio engineers i take grave exception to its omission from the amendment and will vote against the amendment on that ground as well <e>", "<cs> the institution of electronic and radio engineers <e>", "<cs> is it not out of order to cross-connect between the two places in debate in the way that the noble lord is suggesting <e> <s> i would suggest to him that he keeps his thoughts to this chamber and to people in this place and does not worry too much about what happens elsewhere in the palace of westminster <e>", "<cs> of course we have to do so because the market is not proper <e> <s> the trouble is that british telecom has per cent <e> <s> of it thanks to the years of nationalisation previously suffered <e> <s> until the market is made proper one is bound to have some kind of regulatory machinery <e> <s> i personally hope that in due course british telecom will find itself breaking up into bits so that it does not continue to dominate the market <e> <s> i think that that is very dangerous and i entirely agree that it is very dangerous right now before the bill ever becomes an act <e> <s> it is a great pity that we have these huge organisations which have come out of the dogma of noble lords opposite and which dominate markets which they should not dominate <e> <s> we can have proper competition if we have organisations of a reasonable size and we have to have some type of regulatory machinery because that is not yet the case <e>", "<cs> oh yes they do <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate my noble friend lady faithfull very much on bringing this bill before us <e> <s> i also very much support the idea of it being committed to a select committee and i am delighted to hear that the government agree with that approach <e> <s> i will touch on only one or two small points because the bill has been very well dealt with by other speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones i have to apologise to your lordships for the fact that i shall have to leave the chamber shortly after i have ended this speech in order to attend a meeting in another part of this house which has been long arranged though i hope to return here before the debate is concluded <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me i will look to see what remarks there are made about sweden in that respect <e> <s> the point about sweden is that whatever they have in detail they have greatly simplified their total application of the system <e> <s> the report i have shows that sweden until st july had registration plus licensing of all edp files a simplified declaration for standard files and a detailed declaration for other files <e> <s> they had registrations and one registration may contain several files <e> <s> sweden since st july have had one licence for a data controller that is the data controller within a company self-regulation within the company <e> <s> and no inter-country approval for other parties to the european convention <e> <s> that is the difference <e>", "<cs> my lords in my very few remarks i must tell your lordships that i am advised by the confederation of british industry and also by the national farmers union <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should very much like to congratulate the noble lord lord seebohm both on introducing this debate and on the clear way in which he set out the problems as they are before us today <e> <s> this is my first opportunity to congratulate my noble friend lady young on her introduction as to what the government are doing which clearly will not satisfy everybody <e> <s> i think that what they are doing is most enlightening and indeed enlightened in that it is being directed at the areas where the needs are perceived to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be much better if the noble lord did not interrupt at this point <e> <s> i am quite prepared to sit down soon but not now <e> <s> i have a theme and i am trying to develop it <e> <s> the noble lord has already interrupted me enough to be a nuisance <e> <s> to return to the point and i am absolutely at a loss because of the noble lord lord mackie the fact is that we will not feed these people on an urgent basis if we rely entirely on the development of their local agriculture <e> <s> it is a fact that in the developed countries per cent <e> <s> of the food that is consumed today is processed food <e> <s> there are two reasons for that <e> <s> one is that the vast majority of the population is in the urban centres and for practical purposes they can only be fed if there is a reasonable amount of processed food which can be kept over a relatively long period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not talking about food aid i am talking about food trade <e> <s> we are not able to provide the sort of food i am talking about within the food aid umbrella <e> <s> it is the raw materials that the farmers produce or the primary processed products as opposed to the secondary processed products that go in under food aid <e> <s> even that has a problem if your lordships will forgive me for i have really finished <e> <s> there was a stage when we were trying to develop a biscuit which had a high proportion of milk as part of the way of solving the milk lake <e> <s> we tried this out on certain african countries under food aid <e> <s> in the end it came to a halt because it was much too expensive to produce <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is using the wrong phrase when he talks about the subsidy of exports <e> <s> export refunds are not subsidies <e> <s> they are the refund of extra costs endured by paying in accordance with the common agricultural policy higher costs on the raw materials from which the exports are made <e> <s> in point of fact the refunds do not measure up to the extra costs of the raw materials they are always slightly less <e> <s> but in no way are they subsidies <e> <s> it is an error which other people have fallen into in identifying that particular point and i should just like to put the noble lord right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am addressing your lordships as another member of the eec sub-committee d who had the privilege of making this recent trip to northern ireland <e> <s> i was the food processor on the sub-committee and i rather suspect i was brought along by the farmers to teach me a little bit about farming but however that may be <e> <s> i am sure that my arguments with them will continue <e> <s> i too would like very much to congratulate my noble friend on his new appointment and to thank him and his department for their welcome <e> <s> i should also like to thank my noble friend lord brookeborough who set up the whole arrangement in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend give consideration to the matter of policemen standing in park lane with wheel clamps very ostentatiously displayed at midday on every day particularly when parliament is sitting to discourage people from parking <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to support my noble friend <e> <s> perhaps i should initially say that i was not present at the cbi meeting to which the noble lord lord mishcon made reference and gave an account <e> <s> i can only imagine that it took place in the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord donaldson and to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey for their support <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend the minister for explaining the thinking behind the construction of this subsection to which great care was obviously given in order to achieve the objects for which we fought on a earlier occasion <e> <s> i accept the argument of my noble friend that he does not like my amendment exactly as it is because it would spoil the build-up of his subsection <e> <s> on the other hand i think that it probably narrows down this subsection too much even now let alone in a way that might be unsuitable in the future <e>", "<cs> i take the point that my noble friend has made but i shall still seek to try and clarify this later <e> <s> we shall see if anything comes up <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just comment on that <e> <s> i have great sympathy for what the noble lord lord mishcon has said but perhaps he is making rather more of it than in practice at this stage is justified <e> <s> for one thing he quoted various countries in europe <e> <s> they all have a certain number of limitations on what they do <e> <s> although i do not want to bother the committee with the details they do not have a comprehensive scheme in the way in which the noble lord lord mishcon was rather suggesting <e>", "<cs> may i make a few remarks about both amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it seems to me that amendment no <e> <s> tells us what the committee should consist of and what sort of people should be on it but it says nothing about what the committee should do or whom it should advise <e> <s> i should have thought that amendment no <e> <s> was at fault in that respect <e> <s> in any act of parliament if one sets up a body one must say what it has to do or it might do anything <e> <s> that is one disadvantage of the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord going straight on to deal with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> because i thought that we were to deal with this amendment first before we eat <e> <s> are we to deal with amendment no <e> <s> before we eat <e>", "<cs> does that mean that i shall be able to say a little about amendment no <e> <s> before i eat in order to get it out of the way <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord i shall not speak for long <e> <s> if it will help my noble friend when he comes to revise his amendment which he obviously realises he must your lordships may remember that i was in favour of codes of practice when we dealt with this point on the last occasion when we discussed the bill <e> <s> at the time it was probably my noble friend the minister who made me start to think about this <e> <s> broadly speaking i think that centralised codes of practice set out on the lines of amendment no <e> <s> probably have to be so broad that one could almost say that the bill itself was a code of practice and that the bill itself was telling people how to carry out the purposes of schedule <e> <s> therefore that is as far as we ought to go in having centralised codes of practice <e>", "<cs> may i have a copy too <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord forgive me for intervening <e> <s> clearly a data bank cannot communicate with the registrar <e> <s> it must be either a data user or a computer bureau <e> <s> the reason for choosing data banks you could choose the word databases if you prefer is exactly the problem which the computer people would call interface <e> <s> there is no difference of substance <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether noble lords have looked at clause which i believe covers their particular point <e> <s> i may be wrong <e>", "<cs> i stand corrected <e> <s> i stopped learning latin at the age of when i went into the navy which was much more fun <e> <s> i accept my noble friends difficulty in sorting out the answer to this and i am most grateful to him for undertaking to look at what has been said <e> <s> what has never become clear to me is why my group of three amendments would not be acceptable as a good alternative to clarify the situation if there is any doubt and i believe there still to be some doubt <e> <s> i think my noble friend has been generous enough to suggest that maybe after looking at this he might feel the same way <e> <s> i hope that his look might bring him around to finding a solution on the lines of mine which he might care to put down himself <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> it seems to me at first sight as though he has an answer to my problem but i shall examine carefully what he said and consult my advisers and i may come back with this point at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i can help both my noble friend and the noble lords opposite <e> <s> it seems to me that there is a germ of a good idea here <e> <s> noble lords in this amendment are encouraging codes of practice and my noble friend has said that at all stages the government too have encouraged codes of practice <e> <s> where it seems to me as an observer of this latest exchange it has come unstuck is that the present amendment has rather too much legalistic force within it even if it is not compulsory <e> <s> surely it is very useful if people are to produce codes of practice and the government have said that they like that to have an opportunity to refer to the registrar to make sure that the codes of practice conform to the principles <e> <s> that is useful for practical purposes <e>", "<cs> in principle i support the noble lord lord mishcon on the thinking behind what he is advancing which is also reflected in amendments i have yet to move <e> <s> i shall speak to them when i move <e>", "<cs> i think i can answer that <e> <s> i used the application form only as an example of the sort of information that would be there <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> speaks of data which has been supplied to the data user <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for having given the reasons at such length why he is not entirely happy with my amendments <e> <s> some of the general information that he gave us contained a few nuggets which we talked about earlier <e> <s> i shall look carefully to see the nuggets in print and will hope that they will satisfy me and my friends <e> <s> if not perhaps i might come back with an even more carefully contrived solution to the problem the next time we take this point <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am deeply grateful to my noble friend for what he said in answer to amendment no <e> <s> and in answer to this amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it will give us great food for thought <e> <s> i said that it was a probing amendment <e> <s> we shall have a good look and if we can think of anything better we might come back on report <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the argument that it is a rare occasion but it really comes down to the point that my noble friend the minister is saying that the situation is so rare that we do not need to enact for it <e> <s> i should have thought that that was an invitation for fate to intervene and when this bill becomes an act it will not be my situation it will be something else and we shall be caught out <e> <s> i am not sure that i am wholly convinced by the answer but i will certainly look at what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> i was ready to accept my noble friends remarks without qualification until the noble lord lord mcintosh supported him <e> <s> my suspicions are now aroused and i shall have to look carefully at what my noble friend has said <e> <s> it seemed to me that

noble lord lord mcintosh said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply thankful to my noble friend the minister and indeed to the noble lords lord wallace of coslany and lord winstanley for their contributions <e> <s> i do not of course agree with the theme of the main argument of the noble lord lord wallace of coslany <e> <s> it is all a balance of opinion and i think that he has balanced it the wrong way and differently from me <e> <s> of course i liked the view of the noble lord lord winstanley better <e> <s> in a good liberal way he came in between us <e> <s> i am very pleased indeed to have a full explanation from my noble friend the minister on the earlier forms and <e> <s> it is sad about form <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for saying that although there is a reason for not including all the information that perhaps should have been on form guidance from his department will cover this point and deal with what is omitted <e>

wallace and the noble lord lord winstanley for their support of the general theme of my comments on this particular set of rules <e> <s> i am heartened by the extent to which my noble friend the minister has explained the background to the points that i raised and why things are the way they are <e> <s> i am also heartened by the thought that there will be as i understand it explanatory leaflets for the benefit of relatives and indeed others in interpreting these rules and that they will be made available to the appropriate people <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend for spelling out the rights of the nearest relative and for carefully taking us through the rules showing us all the things to which they are entitled <e> <s> that could well form the basis for the type of further information that i sought <e> <s> with those thanks i beg leave to withdraw the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to apologise for not

advanced at committee stage <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords when we discussed this matter in committee i was persuaded absolutely by what my noble friend the minister said which was that expert opinion will be necessary in fact i think three-quarters of his speech was devoted to that but that he did not see any reason to have a statutory body <e> <s> i must say i do not see any reason to have a statutory body <e> <s> i know that my noble friend has been kindly conceding all sorts of things to me and perhaps to other noble lords <e> <s> perhaps he will have changed his mind but my personal view is that we have far too many statutory bodies <e>", "<cs> question <e>", "<cs> my lords if i might briefly comment before my noble friend answers i think we have now come as the noble lord <e> <s> lord mishcon was saying very much closer together <e> <s> the previous amendment no <e> <s> in committee stage referred to the committee which we have

subsection says <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very much to thank my noble friend lady trumpington and of course my noble friend lord elton for having taken on board what i proposed at committee stage and indeed for improving on the third of my amendments and repeating my first two <e> <s> i am sure that they are right about the interpretation of the english over which we argued earlier <e>

association who advised me on this point will be equally delighted <e> <s> i thank my noble friends very much <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am delighted to see that an amendment from the noble lords opposite has also been accepted by my noble friend on the front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord alexander will forgive me if i do not follow his every argument <e> <s> perhaps i might say that he was really rather over-simplifying matters in comparing local authorities with children in school <e> <s> they are vast organisations handling vast sums of money <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords question is that mr walker does not say that that is an offence <e> <s> mr walker has written a very well balanced and fair book which calls to account authorities regardless of party whose procedures have led them to be profligate <e> <s> all mr walker says in relation to the political differences between the parties is that on the whole none of them really gets elected properly because councillors are chosen by a small number of people <e> <s> less than per cent <e> <s> of the electorate actually vote for the candidates <e> <s> therefore local elections are not nearly so democratic as the national system which provides a much wider opportunity for people to choose their prospective candidates since many more electors vote <e>", "<cs>

noble baroness has just picked on those which do not include any mention of them <e>", "<cs> in making my opening remarks i was not casting aspersions against my noble and learned friend the lord

"<cs> my lords what about the soviet union <e> <s> it has a vast civil defence capability and it has nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to add my thanks to my noble friend the minister and indeed to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor who particularly the first time the bill came before us had a great deal to do with it rather more than he did latterly <e> <s> i think that the government have been quite remarkable in regard to the degree to which they have listened to arguments for the amendments which have been put forward not only from this side but also from the opposite side <e> <s> it has been very heartening that they should have done that <e> <s> it has also impressed me greatly that some of the points on which my noble friend appeared obdurate were at a later stage the subject of amendments that he himself provided to meet the arguments which had been raised <e> <s> this shows a breadth of thought on the part of the government and of the noble lord and i like to think that perhaps it is also due to the good advice received from his advisers <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me may i ask him how many votes were cast in

know <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether i heard him say that he thought grunwick was an example of experts not being allowed into a firm by the management <e>

lord lord houghton of sowerby and i am so pleased <e> <s> i had not spotted that he and i are the only lay contributors to this debate <e> <s> there are other features your lordships will see on which

you talk about power that is the power in watts at transmission from the aerial <e> <s> the range depends entirely on the conditions under which it operates and <e>", "<cs> if i might intervene the reason that the amendment is not moved is that it is already covered by other amendments which the government accepted at an earlier stage <e> <s> it was one of a block overtaken by the governments acceptance of about seven or eight amendments <e>", "<cs> does my noble friend mean that there are going to be special arrangements that so far as possible meet the needs of the water industry <e>", "<cs> i am deeply grateful to my noble friend for confirming that <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that i appreciate his argument <e> <s> but could he explain why he is including a totally new clause instead of proposing to amend clause which seems to go a long way towards what he wants in matters of detail to which he drew our attention <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i have the greatest respect for the noble lord lord mishcon hut i find that answer very complicated <e> <s> one might have been encouraged to support his theme although of course the detail would need to be left to my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> if he was tightening up clause in whatever area he wishes i would be right behind him but i think that he has duplicated matters because both clause and his new clause provide for a code of practice and we do not want two codes of practice <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may give a practical reason for this which i believe is worth putting before your lordships to show how necessary it is there will be cable television systems established in areas among others containing a high proportion of business premises <e> <s> in such cases the liability of the cable television operation and the return on investment made may be dependent upon the supply of cable programme services to the business community within the franchised area in particular interactive services including for example data services <e> <s> the ability of the cable operator to achieve that will depend in part upon having an adequate market for such services <e> <s> that in turn will be greatly influenced by what other telecommunication services are licensed to be provided in the same area <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend the minister will allow me it does not meet the point made in my speech <e> <s> if he cares to read my speech carefully he will find that just dealing with the question of the cable operator is only one side of the argument <e> <s> the people who want to take up the cable licence will want to know what other telecommunication licences have been given in their area <e> <s> so it has to go rather wider than my noble friend is saying <e> <s> perhaps he will take that into account at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i differ only in detail from my noble friend lord auckland in that i am opposed to the amendment precisely because it is so narrow <e> <s> i do not believe that its spirit is right because it narrows us right down to the ec <e> <s> my noble friend has referred to the splendid developments in television in commonwealth countries <e> <s> australia comes especially to mind but there are others <e> <s> the amendment if we are landed with it seems to me to stultify us <e> <s> i would prefer to see proper as it stands <e> <s> however if we are to have an amendment along the lines of maximum practicable whatever that means it is not easy then i should like to see the words and the commonwealth <e> <s> it has to be remembered that some of the principal producers currently in the united states come from australia <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply grateful to my noble friend the minister for taking so much trouble to try and clarify this area <e> <s> i do not think that my amendment would do it <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lord de la warr has uncovered some hole that is not quite met <e> <s> my noble friend will perhaps think about it when he has a chance to examine what everyone has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend very much for taking the trouble to give me such a full answer <e> <s> i think the real problem is that in some parts of the country the local citizenry do not approve of the allocations of areas that have been made by the high panjandrums sitting in whitehall <e> <s> it is as simple as that and the cable operator will be the person in between who may be able to redress what people have been grumbling about for a long time <e> <s> that is a different picture but i quite see that my noble friend has produced a very comprehensive answer <e> <s> i will not say that i am entirely satisfied but it is certainly not worth fighting so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely wish to say briefly that i am most grateful to my noble friend for clarifying this issue because it makes it much more sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might briefly support my noble friend lord de la warr on one point only <e> <s> in reading what my noble friend the minister said last time and it has been very helpful i came up with two points <e> <s> the first point was that it seemed to me that his amendments which he has already spoken to were helpful in that they clarified the situation but i was left with the thought that amendment no <e> <s> in particular did not really relax the severity of subsection <e> <s> i think from what other noble lords have said that probably he will be addressing himself to that when he comes to reply but it really does seem to me i believe this is what my noble friend was saying and giving good reasons for it that subsection newly amended by amendment no <e> <s> is still very severe <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to support in principle the amendment of the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe <e> <s> it seems to me logical that in the areas which are common to what the broadcasting complaints commission is currently doing as the noble lord lord mishcon has just said the same body should continue to do the same things <e> <s> i suggest to my noble friend that this is the aspect of it to which he might like to give some thought with a view to perhaps tabling an amendment of his own incorporating the principles embodied in the three amendments tabled by the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not think that his remarks have underpinned the <e>", "<cs> my lords does that therefore mean that all cable companies must keep records of all their transmissions for two months apart from those in regard to which they are excused <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this is a private members bill which was initiated in another place by my honourable friend mrs peacock and moved at second reading by my honourable friend mr bottomley <e> <s> the bill had an unimpeded passage through another place <e> <s> the purpose of the bill is to amend the law relating to driving instruction contained in part v of the road traffic act <e> <s> the present provisions make it necessary for anyone who gives instruction in the driving of motor cars for payment or reward to be registered as an approved driving instructor or licensed as a trainee instructor <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful to all noble lords who with a few qualifications have supported the bill <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth for saying that the government welcome the bill and for answering many of the points raised by other noble lords <e> <s> i am also most grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for his unqualified support from the main opposition front bench <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for supporting most of what is in the bill from the liberal benches <e>", "<cs> is it right for a noble lord from whatever bench to speak after the minister who is moving the amendment has made his final speech <e> <s> it seems to me to be most unusual <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether his recollections of events of were not in fact of events of <e>", "<cs> my lords something i did not quite follow in lord bruces statement was when he said that licences can be amended <e> <s> but they obviously cannot be amended contrary to clause because every licence must comply with clause <e> <s> therefore any amendment that is put in if it was originally in accordance with the new wording in amendment would have to continue to be in accordance with that <e>", "<cs> my lords if this were not about directory inquiry services i might think it something that one could support but this particular service is the most obviously inefficient of all those services that british telecom currently provide to us <e> <s> furthermore it has got very much worse since when the government which noble lords opposite used to support made british telecom independent of its civil service position <e> <s> i admit that before that time it was much more efficient and to that extent i agree with what the noble lord lord stoddart was saying earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords if i could just quickly ask my noble friend a question he made a lot of statements but did not produce much argument with the greatest possible respect to him <e> <s> i know how difficult it must be particularly if you have a brief which is dogmatic even if you arc not dogmatic yourself <e> <s> but to say that putting fair into this subsection wrecks the bill or seriously alters its entire tenor is really going too far <e> <s> i do not know whether the house would agree but i think that if it were possible for him to say something more explanatory rather than dogmatic then maybe we could understand what he says <e> <s> but for me it means nothing and i trust that my noble friends who put this amendment down will if they do not take this to a division return to the charge at third reading at which time i trust that any noble lord on the front bench will he properly briefed to make an explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be able to help my noble friend lord peyton <e> <s> my noble friend lord orr-ewing explained i thought very thoroughly how important the civil radio spectrum is to industry which is developing at all times <e> <s> it is important to telecommunications not only in the sorts of areas he mentioned but it is used extensively by british telecom at the moment for ordinary linkage <e> <s> the point at issue is that it is absolutely vital that the radio frequencies are allocated fairly in respect of all those seeking to use them so as to develop this great resource for the benefit of all of us in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the word available is there because we are talking about the civil use of the radio spectrum and there are an enormous number of frequencies which are held by the ministry of defence also i think unreasonably <e> <s> but it has to be there for that reason <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down he mentioned amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> when we come to that amendment i hope we will be debating it fully <e> <s> can he reassure me on that point <e>", "<cs> not good enough <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said my amendment was a probing one <e> <s> i hope that my noble and learned friend will perhaps go a little further in view of the fact that the next day for the bills report stage is not until next monday <e> <s> possibly before third reading there can be a more explicit statement taking into account the points i have just made <e> <s> is my noble and learned friend able to go that far <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that would be as well because it is much too late to go into a long and complicated argument <e> <s> basically and i think the noble lord lord spens feels the same it seems that clause is not strong enough in this area whereas the government think it is <e> <s> perhaps we can discuss it outside the chamber and if your lordships agree i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble and learned friend send me a copy of the letter that he will write to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment has been moved in response to an amendment moved by me in committee and i should like to thank my noble friend very much both for the amendment and for the careful explanation that he has given of how it meets the requirements we then sought <e> <s> may i also say that pounc support the amendment as do many others <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of myself and my colleagues here and my noble friend lord de la warr who regrettably has not been able to be here for this debate i wish to thank my noble friend the minister for the trouble that he has taken to ensure that there is proper reciprocal consultation between the two authorities in the telecommunications bill and this bill and to welcome the arrangements that he has made <e> <s> i can do no more than thank him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that my noble friends earlier argument made it completely clear that he would not agree with the amendment that has just been moved <e> <s> in addition to what my noble friend said earlier i would add that i believe that the amendment is perhaps not being quite fair regarding the question of the reliance that should be placed upon the cable authority itself <e> <s> it seems to me that there will be chosen for the authority the same kind of excellent people such as the noble lord lord hill who were chosen to lead the other bodies such as the iba and i think that we should trust them a little to make a judgment on this particular point <e> <s> to imply that they will need to have their hands held very tightly by parliament in the ways that have been suggested in particular by the noble lord lord jenkins is going a little far <e> <s> i hope that your lordships feel that this amendment needs to be rejected even more firmly than the previous amendment which looking backwards so to speak was an improvement on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend for the courtesy with which he has handled our various amendments and the way in which he has endeavoured to meet us when he can and in particular for amendment no <e> <s> that we considered today <e> <s> he has reminded us of the unicorn in seeking a conclusion <e> <s> there is one point about that <e> <s> the unicorn was only eventually revealed because we had two stabs at the data protection bill <e> <s> i would not suggest that every time we want to solve a very knotty problem we should have a general election in order to make sure that it happens <e>", "<cs> i am sure my lords but i speaking from the back-benches can say what i think in this sort of respect <e> <s> i hope that this bill which is much improved will receive a fair run in another place and that it will not be long before it reaches the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly <e> <s> i really think that noble lords opposite have been confusing not only themselves but possibly noble lords on this side of the house as well <e> <s> it seems quite clear from what my noble and learned friend has said and he has said it many more times than he should have been invited to do on a report stage that subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to bother my noble friend <e> <s> part iv is going to be struck out when the cable bill becomes law <e> <s> that is fine <e> <s> in the committee stage we amended parts of part iv but that did not matter because it is to be struck out <e> <s> can i be assured that the cable bill will acquire the necessary amendment to remove the reference to part iv in amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house may i point out that the cable bill has left this house <e> <s> perhaps my noble friends could note this point so that the necessary action can be taken in another place if it has not been thought of already <e>", "<cs> my lords i really think that either the noble lord lord bruce is more ignorant than i believe or he is deliberately trying to misconstrue the situation in order dare i say it <e> <s> to direct the house in the wrong direction because what he omits to take into account is the fact that we are talking about a vast monopoly <e> <s> when a vast monopoly uses its vast funds for advertising on a narrow front as excessively as my noble friend has been pointing out that is a form of cross-subsidisation because it is using funds that smaller competitors do not have <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend would allow me to say a word <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said i repeat all activities connected with telecommunications <e> <s> i do not see the word all in subsection of clause <e> <s> it refers simply to activities <e>", "<cs> my lords if i can expand on what the noble lord lord spens says the point about frequencies is that they are in short supply as everyone agrees <e> <s> they are essential to hold all telecommunications in the old-fashioned style of wireless <e> <s> because they are in short supply and because <e>", "<cs> my lords my remarks are directed to the government amendments and not to the amendments to the amendments which the government will deal with themselves <e> <s> pounc and i note that the noble lord <e> <s> lord somers is not here have a couple of points to make about this <e> <s> they have not led to amendments but i think it is reasonable on their behalf to ask the government to give consideration to them <e> <s> they say that they do not object to the identification of special interest groups such as are currently in subsection and of course now in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment of my noble friend lord glanusk without qualification for the reasons he most sensibly put forward <e> <s> i hope that the house will give the support that has been recommended by my noble friend on the front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords my notes say amendment no <e> <s> was the one he spoke to yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords did my noble friend say that was when the agreement was made <e> <s> was there no opportunity in the tokyo round of gatt negotiations to bring up to date the arrangements between ourselves and spain <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank very much the noble lord lord plowden for so skilfully introducing this debate and for his even more skilful chairmanship of the rather disparate and differently opinionated members of sub-committee d i shall be as brief as i can and speak about the main points as i see them <e> <s> first i must declare an interest <e> <s> i am employed by the cake and biscuit alliance which manufactures biscuits and packaged cakes <e> <s> therefore i speak from the point of view of food manufacturers and my opening remarks relate to what the industry sees as the main points <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly that would be included but it is not mainly for electronic mail <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful to my noble and learned friend not only for his clear explanation but for the time and trouble he spent before we got to this stage of the bill to make sure that we understood these points <e> <s> what comes out of the amendment is that it is going to be important in order to get this efficiency which underlies both these amendments that the licences that are given to the non-public networks are given swiftly and not delayed one bit once this bill becomes law <e> <s> i hope that both the director when he is set up and the secretary of state perhaps even before then will give great attention to the swift granting of licences when they are applied for <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for putting his amendment in such measured terms and for showing that he appreciates the problem that we shall have with regard to the passage of this bill in the event that this amendment is made to it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for taking up the suggestion that there should be careful amendment to the regulations to take in as much of the amendment of the noble lord lord tordoff as can be <e> <s> indeed he has gone further and said that he has invited the noble lord if he wishes to advise or take part in discussions on that sort of amendment <e> <s> that takes us a long way and i hope that the amendment will not be pressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to include myself with those who have offered congratulations to the noble lord lord bottomley <e> <s> it is remarkable that he was able to make what must have been an uncontroversial speech by our rules on a very controversial bill without anyone noticing whether he had or not <e> <s> let us hope he gives us splendid speeches in future <e> <s> i should also like to give my thanks and congratulations to my noble friend lord bellwin on the front bench <e> <s> i think that only the noble baroness lady birk has done that <e> <s> i thought he gave a very good introductory speech to lead us into this bill <e> <s> as usual it was a very mild one although perhaps his winding-up speech will not be quite so mild <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord hunter of newington upon introducing this debate so skilfully and for making clear to us the outstanding points which we have to consider <e> <s> as i said in an earlier speech on the subject i am deeply concerned that unless these kind of problems are tackled the national health service will over the years price itself out of existence <e> <s> if we are to keep the nhs which i am sure we all want to do it is very important that this problem should be tackled <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness may say why not <e> <s> but doctors may not necessarily be good managers <e>", "<cs> my lords they may on the other hand even if they have the potential to be good managers consider management to be simple something which any intelligent person can do and that therefore they do not have to try very hard to become good managers <e> <s> industrial history is littered with examples of companies which have gone bust when they have been passed on to successors who have taken that kind of view or who have naturally been bad managers <e> <s> unfortunately the national health service as a whole and its individual units and hospitals are spared the discipline of going bust so if they are badly managed they just become inefficient and are unhappy places for staff and patients alike <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord proceeds may i put one point <e> <s> if this person is clapped out will he not have the best health service in the world at his disposal <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever else my noble friend lord sudeley may have achieved he has managed to muster more bishops than i have ever seen before in this chamber since i have had the privilege of being in this house <e> <s> to be slightly serious we ought to be deeply grateful to them because we all know what tremendous commitments they have in their dioceses and it is splendid that they have all been able to attend <e> <s> i add my thanks to the most reverend primate for his introductory speech and in making the position so clear <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to intervene <e> <s> it seems to me that this clause and in particular this subsection is referring to total expenditure they are not referring to detailed expenditure <e> <s> surely the principles upon which total expenditure is decided are ones which really ought to be determined by the secretary of state in consultation with those who are concerned with total expenditure <e> <s> to widen the provision so as to require him to consult statutorily with the local authorities is surely not correct in regard to total expenditure <e> <s> if we were talking about detailed expenditure it would be a different matter altogether <e> <s> but here we are talking about maximum sums <e> <s> this must be a matter of basic policy for the government and the secretary of state is the person concerned in this respect and it seems to me that the argument that the noble lord lord underhill has just put forward talks about not total expenditure but detailed expenditure which is a different matter altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i too spotted that the noble lord lord hatch had overlooked dare i say characteristically <e> <s> the third noun diffusion <e> <s> i also noted that the noble lord lord hatch when he opened his speech talked about freedom as being through power which is the last way i would have thought of it <e> <s> i was tempted to take the points as they came but that would be very boring <e> <s> i think that it may be found that what i have to say is in remarkable contrast to what we have just heard <e> <s> i suspect that if the noble lord lord hatch sought to say it he would say that it is disgraceful that we have over per cent <e> <s> unemployed <e> <s> i would say that it is splendid that we have nearly per cent <e> <s> employed <e> <s> the noble lord might say with great passion that the number of unemployed should be reduced i would say also with great passion i believe that the number in employment should be increased <e> <s> there is a fundamental difference of approach which i think will spread throughout my contrasting statements <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point made by the noble lord may i say that i am delighted i hope he will get on with it <e> <s> on the second point perhaps he would delay his general contribution in that area until we debate the relevant bill when it comes to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to say that if i had not been so eager to get into battle with the noble lord lord hatch i would have asked to apologise to the house for the fact that owing to a long-standing previous engagement i shall not be able to stay to the end of the debate <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lords on the front benches who will be winding up <e> <s> and in particular to my noble friend lord cockfield and my noble friend lord beloff <e>", "<cs> what disappointed me about the speech of the noble lord lord graham was that at both the beginning and the end he sought to create the impression that the phrase in the bill which refers to industrial and commercial ratepayers was referring to individual people <e>", "<cs> that is how it came over <e> <s> it seemed to me that that was the gloss the noble lord was putting on it because he then talked about it not affecting businessmen and business women <e> <s> the fact is that it is not talking about people it is talking about businesses which have to struggle to remain in existence <e> <s> the noble lord took his argument on to the fact that they will pass their extra costs on to the customer <e> <s> they will pass on their costs to the customer only if they are inefficient and they cannot make a success of their business <e>", "<cs> may i underline the point that my noble friend has made about the fact that it seems rather unfair in view of the nature of clause that business organisations should not be consulted too <e> <s> if there are to be preliminary consultations they are rather one-sided <e> <s> all the other points made by my noble friend put my mind at rest and i hope they have done the same for the noble lord too <e>", "<cs> if i may speak before my noble friend replies i should like to make a special point <e> <s> what the noble baroness <e> <s> lady fisher has just said is very important and needs to be taken note of <e> <s> but it is not really part of the bill as it stands <e> <s> what disappoints me is that clause is entitled <e> <s> duty to consult industrial and commercial ratepayers <e> <s> in replying to amendment no <e> <s> my noble friend said in effect that the guidelines would require a local authority to consult pretty well anybody and not to make a speciality of the commercial and business ratepayers which is the point of the governments clause <e> <s> i hope that this broad brush arrangement to try to get the noble <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend the minister but i am even more grateful to my noble friend lord broxbourne because i think that he has pointed a way through <e> <s> i feel that perhaps governments and i do not mean party government because this rates problem has gone on for a long time have all the time studied and considered the problem primarily from the end of the domestic ratepayer <e> <s> the situation that has developed is that the basic arrangement by which business and industry pay for services rendered by the local authority which is the basic principle of the matter has diverged so much and there are so many special rules and exceptions that there is little relation between the two <e> <s> the question of taxing business could well deserve an across-the-board look in order to produce a rate <e>", "<cs> no because i am proposing that we set up not an inquiry into the rating system but an inquiry into the industrial taxation system which is rather different <e> <s> i do not know if my noble friend is going to respond <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am indeed grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> do i understand that he has two amendments in contemplation to deal with my one amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and i look forward with great interest and hope to the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> it is a complicated subject and unsuitable for this time of night <e> <s> as usual schedules always seem to come at the end <e>

four amendments together <e> <s> the noble lord lord banks did not say so to start with <e> <s> alternatively are we just debating amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i have great sympathy with this group of amendments as such but not particularly with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that is why i asked my question earlier on <e> <s> in fact i am not sure that the better line of approach is not

wish to apologise to your lordships for not having been here at second reading <e> <s> i do not intend to make a second reading speech what i say will be very brief <e> <s> i have to declare an interest as president of the isle of wight association of town and parish councils and as a vice-president of the national association of local councils so i have a little experience in this area

i am on my feet i should like to make one point to my noble friend <e> <s> whatever happens to this bill i believe that the government ought to regard this as a matter which needs progressing <e> <s> my noble friend said that this was a cumbersome way in which to proceed <e> <s> perhaps there is a better way <e> <s> perhaps the government could come up with a better way <e> <s> but the fact is that the need for parishes locally throughout the country is growing <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene for a very good reason if the noble lord lord molloy will allow me <e>", "<cs> my lords it is out of order to quote what has been said by a member other than a member of the government <e> <s> in another place <e> <s> i think that the noble lord ought to have been stopped a little sooner <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i got hold of the wrong end of the stick <e> <s> i thought he was quoting a member of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought the noble lord <e> <s> lord molloy expressed surprise that the conservatives had been converted to the national health service <e> <s> i put it to him that it can be the other way about <e> <s> i admired the national health service from the word go because i was a very poorly-paid naval officer with a large family which had to grow up and the national health service was absolutely vital <e> <s> however because of the performance and policies of the labour party not least in not paying me very much when they were in power and i was in the navy i found myself converted to the conservatives <e> <s> so your lordships can take it that it is the other way round a national health supporter has been converted to the conservatives rather than the way round the noble lord put it <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell your lordships how much i admire my right honourable leader and how much benefit bifocal spectacles have been to me <e> <s> i went to the optician and he said that i needed

course <e> <s> the ships names and badges committee i am sure my noble friend is aware has a very difficult task but let us hope that before the end of the century some of these names will be coming back again <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask this <e> <s> on amendment no <e> <s> is clause to go after clause in its new place or its old place <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the amendment for exactly the same reason as the noble lord has said <e> <s> this particular amendment will perhaps be more sweeping than one would particularly want because i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> lord northfield that competition should be encouraged <e> <s> however i am deeply concerned because i understand that this is a paving subsection for doing away with the requirement for qualified dispensers <e> <s> as i said on second reading i fear greatly that with unqualified dispensers the restraint on making sure that the proper prescription is presented and that it is a recent one will not be there because they will not be professional people <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend said that he was taking his amendments and with number <e> <s> is that right <e>", "<cs> it was a little surprising to have nearly an -minute speech in a committee stage in this house from the number two speaker <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will note that <e> <s> the point that the noble <e>", "<cs> the point about this is that the prescription has a validity <e> <s> both the noble lords said that it did not have a validity for the maximum number of people <e> <s> that may be true but it has a validity for some of the people some of the time <e> <s> i take very much the point that was made briefly in a splendid speech by the noble baroness lady robson of kiddington that we do not want to rush into making a total change overnight <e> <s> we have a system which has been serving us well <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals pointed out how other countries are coming in our direction <e>", "<cs> yes i think that this is true <e> <s> i do not know about the united states <e> <s> i am always suspicious about the united states <e>", "<cs> suspicious in the sense that sometimes people will go over there and do things which are not legal under the law of the state in question at the time <e> <s> so one needs to watch that but in europe i think this is true <e>", "<cs> with your lordships permission i should like to speak to my own amendment amendment no <e> <s> which is in effect an alternative to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend to explain this <e> <s> do i understand that he agrees at any rate with the first part of my amendment and will put down an amendment of his own at the next stage or is he suggesting that the relevant parts of it will be incorporated in the relevant orders <e>", "<cs> i too support my noble friend <e> <s> it seems to me that at the moment apart from the point made on my amendment no <e> <s> the bill contains so much of the detail which will be set out in the orders that this is a case where we should have an affirmative procedure and not a negative one <e> <s> i should have thought that the case for it is overwhelming and i hope that my noble friend will agree <e>", "<cs> what relevance has the speech which the noble lord lord rugby has just made and the one he made earlier to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it may have been suitable for other occasions but of all the amendments it has no relevance to amendment no <e> <s> apart from the fact that it was most distateful and uncalled for but that is neither here nor there <e> <s> it is quite irrelevant and i should think that it is out of order in the committee <e>", "<cs> as i am advised the effect of this amendment no <e> <s> would be to change the defence available to someone prosecuted for selling an optical appliance to make it easier for ready-made reading glasses to be sold without prescription <e> <s> that is the practical effect as opposed to all the remarks that the noble lord lord rugby made <e>", "<cs> i am advised that this also would provide a similar extension to the last amendment to defences available to an individual prosecuted for selling readymade glasses <e> <s> i think perhaps it is not all that it seems <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord might take a leaf out of my book <e> <s> i always keep a spare pair of spectacles and a screwdriver in my briefcase because i have had just the same experience as he has <e> <s> i do it myself and no one has taken me to court yet <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should all be grateful to the noble and gallant lord lord cameron <e> <s> indeed i agree greatly with practically everything that he said <e> <s> i would propose to confine myself to the morale aspects of his motion which i do not think have been touched on perhaps as much as they should have been and to concentrate particularly on canada where i had the privilege of being the naval adviser to the british high commissioner in and when the canadians were introducing their own very similar arrangements similar in this case in particular in relation to the reorganisation of their staff and the abolition of policy staffs for the three service chiefs and indeed the abolition of the three service chiefs as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise in advance for the fact that in order to keep a long-standing engagement i may miss some part of the debate if it prolongs itself <e> <s> i should like to start by adding to the remarks of my noble friend the minister in paying respect to my noble friend the late lord glasgow <e> <s> my noble friend so often led for the navy from these benches with his usual charm and sincerity in our defence debates <e> <s> he gave the house the benefit of his great knowledge and experience especially on the importance of safeguarding the south african cape route for shipping <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord began his argument forgetting what he has just been saying on the sequence of bills he said that it would be perfectly right for the constable to arrest the man in question if he saw the video nasties and did not go on about the name <e> <s> if they were written material that is perfectly right <e> <s> but video nasties cannot be seen if they are unmarked <e> <s> you have to show them on a video tape recorder <e> <s> my feeling was that the noble lords argument was undermined from the beginning because he was talking about something which is not like reading a book and one might have to arrest a man anyhow in order to see whether the video nasties were nasty <e> <s> i think the substance of what this clause has in it gives him the powers to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords we know <e>", "<cs> before speaking to this amendment i hope i can mention an impending interest that in months time i shall be an old-age pensioner <e>", "<cs> i briefly support my noble friend lord cullen for the reasons he gave in his excellent introductory speech <e>", "<cs> my lords it saddens me to have to disagree with my noble friend lord cullen in particular in relation to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> on amendment no <e> <s> i do not have a particular feeling one way or the other <e> <s> i think that it is not altogether right to single out one particular official body and not to include a composite balancing amount from for instance the association of optical practitioners who as i have told your lordships give me advice on this point <e> <s> i think that it is probably wrong and i find myself remarkably in sympathy with what the noble lord lord rugby had to say <e> <s> perhaps i have said quite enough for the time being <e>", "<cs> i wish to make one small point <e> <s> i think that my noble friend inadvertently misquoted <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend lord cullen <e> <s> my view is the same as his <e> <s> i am not at all sure that i am happy with what my noble friend the minister has said but he said a great deal and for that i am grateful <e> <s> i shall look very carefully to see what it is and see whether it is good enough <e> <s> i must confess that i find myself although i have heard this before slightly alarmed that people can practise medicine without being qualified <e> <s> i am not sure that that ought not to be tightened up particularly these days when people are damaging themselves with drugs from all sorts of directions <e> <s> i know that that is irrelevant but i would have thought that that needs tightening up rather this needing loosening <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might briefly intervene to say that the principle of the amendments of the noble lord lord henderson and i am not talking about the third one seems to me to be very necessary to this house <e> <s> like the noble lord lord henderson i am not talking about principles i am talking on an all-party basis as far as i can <e> <s> however i think we have all found it most frustrating that you cannot amend orders <e> <s> i think there should be an intervening stage at which it can be <e> <s> wherever it is introduced <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson is seeking to introduce it in this bill but i am not particularly arguing for that <e> <s> i think it is worth all of us giving encouragement to the thought that there is a way of resenting an order so that it can be amended <e> <s> it does not happen all that frequently <e> <s> i have felt it very strongly and so have several of my noble friends when we have been in opposition let alone when we are in government on the back-benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful that at this late hour my noble friend should be concessionary and should be prepared to take us a long way <e> <s> i hope that he is successful with his inquiries and will get the matter in question into his order for next year <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am just suggesting that my noble friend does not know about the latest computers <e>", "<cs> the interesting point about the speeches of the noble lords lord mccarthy and lord rochester is that neither of them tackled the problem of intimidation of the ordinary person who is a trade unionist <e> <s> i believe this is an important factor and one that has grown rather than decreased in importance in recent years <e> <s> it is probably fair to say that the difficult task which the govenment have in trying to strike the right balance is entirely in order to protect the person who does not want to become involved in whatever action is proposed for whatever reason <e>", "<cs> yes i can give an early one <e> <s> that was when there was a strike in swindon in the late s at one of the subsidiaries of british leyland or whatever it was called at that stage which produced bodies for motor cars <e> <s> i had a couple of friends in my village who were employed in this company <e> <s> they were totally against what they had been ordered to do but they were equally totally terrified of standing up against this at all <e> <s> they were quite ordinary chaps they were very sensible they knew very well that if they were on strike for <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in his amendment and perhaps enlarge on why we have amendment no <e> <s> which seeks to replace clause of the bill <e> <s> i too am advised by the cbi <e> <s> it says that it is uncertain whether there is liability under the common law where a trades union induces its members to take industrial action not in breach of their contracts of employment <e> <s> for that reason amendment no <e> <s> takes the form of the creation of a new statutory duty on trades unions rather than a curtailing of their legal immunities <e>", "<cs> may i support my noble friend <e> <s> it seems to me that what people are forgetting is that there is a report stage to come <e> <s> as has been said there is a lot of room for not moving amendments at this stage unless they are clearly going to be useful and bringing them in at report <e> <s> i should have thought that the amendment of the noble earl lord halsbury was one which would be valuable anyhow but that some of the other amendments might well he not moved at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a brief word <e> <s> it strikes me that the other place has made a splendid job of improving the improvements that we made in practically all and in particular these amendments that we have just heard about <e> <s> they really ought to be congratulated as being a first-class revising chamber for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lady faithfull <e> <s> all the arguments she advanced are of the kind which have been put to me by the natonal society for the prevention of cruelty to children on whose central committee i sit as being their concern <e> <s> they have exactly the same problem <e> <s> i think from the wording of my noble friends amendment that it covers that sort of nonprofitmaking body as well as social services of an official nature i would hope it would but the principle that she was on is exactly the same as for the nspcc and i hope that the government will be able to accept this amendment or if not this something very like it <e>", "<cs> my lords i still do not understand why my noble friends amendment is not acceptable <e>", "<cs> i welcome this amendment <e> <s> i am only sorry that we did not think of it when the bill passed through our house <e> <s> it is a very practical addition to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i as a humble back-bencher add my thanks to my noble friend on the front bench for having steered this bill through this house with such skill and care <e> <s> i should like to say what a pleasure it has been working with him on it <e>", "<cs> speaking from this side of the committee may i suggest to the noble baroness that the key words are <e>", "<cs> may i say briefly that i hope the government will hurry up and reduce inflation below per cent <e> <s> so that one of my occupational pensions does not start to erode <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i do not know what my noble friend will do <e> <s> i think that may noble friend the minister has been speaking a little aggressively in the circumstances <e> <s> i hope very much that my noble friend lord cullen and the other noble lords who support him will come back on this general subject at the next stage of the bill when i shall be delighted to support them <e> <s> the whole principle of the unqualified dispenser is one on which i have not been satisfied with the governments arguments <e> <s> i think that they are barking up the wrong tree and i hope that they will have another thought when we come back at the next stage <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> i would suggest to my noble friend the minister that one of the main arguments that the government advanced for supporting the first four clauses of the bill was that <e>", "<cs> a great deal has been said from the benches opposite which misses the point <e> <s> we have here an example of one of the authorities already acting in a rebellious sense against this countrys elected central government and it has declared its intention to be even more rebellious <e> <s> my noble friend lord bellwin gave examples of that <e> <s> it is very important indeed that there should be measures to curtail it <e> <s> the noble lord lord tordoff said that powers were being removed <e> <s> powers are not being removed <e> <s> they are being checked up on <e> <s> they are still there <e> <s> my noble friend did not mention any of the metropolitan county councils perhaps because he has not detected the rebellious spirit which is present in the glc <e> <s> there is no doubt about it <e> <s> your lordships should not be at all fooled by it <e> <s> there is a rebellious spirit which must be curtailed and contained <e>", "<cs> yes indeed and if their expenditure is reasonable the secretary of state will approve it <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> perhaps one could read it from the fact that my noble friend on the front bench did not mention the other metroplitan county councils when he gave examples of why this is necessary <e> <s> many of the points which the noble baroness made were off the point of what the amendment is about <e> <s> it is to make sure that there is a measure of control <e> <s> that is in the interests of the ratepayers of london because they are the potential sufferers from mis-spending by a wild group of people who feel that their days are ended <e> <s> the ratepayers of london will be the sufferers <e> <s> the whole point of this legislation is to protect the ratepayers in the areas concerned <e> <s> i very much trust that my noble friends and those on other benches will support this amendment which i believe to be very necessary in the circumstances <e> <s> it is sad that it should have to be necessary <e> <s> i hope that everybody will support the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is not for me to tell the government how to write their amendment <e> <s> the fact is that this particular bill is all about not only the glc but also the other vast county councils <e> <s> therefore there must be equality of treatment throughout <e> <s> this particular amendment is so worded that if any of those bodies behave in a sensible fashion the new clause is not something that need worry them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is talking nonsense <e> <s> my noble friend did not make that point <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me how the bands that the army has compare both in cost and numbers with those of the royal marines <e> <s> could he further tell me what band is going to replace that which is currently allocated to the rd flotilla <e>", "<cs> my lords i must open by apologising for the fact that i have a commitment which will mean my leaving before the end of the debate <e> <s> i apologise in particular to the noble lords and the noble baroness on the front benches <e> <s> i am sure that this will incur the displeasure of the noble baroness lady nicol but she is not present to hear me <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend any explanations as to why large lorries and transporters seem to have increased their speeds to up to miles an hour in the last months in a way that is rather surprising <e> <s> is there a new dispensation for them or are they still restricted to miles an hour <e>", "<cs> my

lords is my noble friend aware that some years ago the mayor of weymouth had a problem with hippies on open grassland in weymouth and he managed to persuade them to leave by fertilising it with pigs blood <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply directly to my noble friend we agree on most things but on this he is so fundamentally and irretrievably wrong that it is sad to hear <e> <s> the various speeches have been very lengthy <e> <s> i entirely support what the noble lord lord ennals said <e> <s> it was sad to hear the noble lord lord northfield repeating what he has said so many times already <e> <s> i answered at column of <e>", "<cs> well my lords that is what it is you see <e> <s> we will not go into the detailed arguments because there is not time but the specs that are unsubsidised will be cheaper under the new system <e> <s> that is the first point <e> <s> it gives the wrong impression that opticians are making tremendous profits <e> <s> all these vicious remarks about how wicked the opticians are are getting off the point and not ones with which your lordships should bother <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to this amendment as opposed to the one before could i suggest to my noble friend that the key factor in this particular amendment is the proper standard of competence in ophthalmic dispensing <e> <s> this is really requiring the government in the order to lay down a minimum training standard for these people who are taking over from people who if one is to believe what the noble lord lord bowden said at committee stage have taken a two-year course

of course and it has been developed by people like the noble lord lord bowden to meet a particular need to virtually zero in training standards seems to me to be going too far <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend the minister for his concluding remarks <e> <s> i should like to make one point that the association of optical practitioners did take legal advice <e> <s> they were seeking to tighten it up a bit more to meet what my noble friend lord caithness had said at an earlier stage of the bill <e> <s> they were lawyers so it was not a case of amateurs <e> <s> i am an amateur <e>", "<cs> my lords i have spoken and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest possible respect to my noble friend this is a report stage <e> <s> i think

party matter because as governments come and go this situation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords in certain respects my noble friend has answered some of my questions <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord caithness implied that registered opticians seek to retain nhs dispensing exclusively for financial gain while saying publicly that it is an unremunerative chore <e> <s> that hurt rather deeply <e>",

would it not be rather quicker if the noble lord was not making a second reading speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point that the noble lord <e> <s> lord graham is making <e> <s> however he casts his thought as to what will happen if the main bill does not reach the statute book until october <e> <s> if on the other hand the main bill is rather quicker for whatever reason surely things of the sort that this clause is trying to ensure are best discussed good and early so as to get them out of the way as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i noticed that in her fairly lengthy speech the noble baroness made no mention of the ratepayers <e> <s> has she considered the safeguards for ratepayers which might be involved in the governments present attitude and which her amendments would reduce <e> <s> it is all very well being grand about the sort of things she has mentioned but the ratepayers are very important <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that after the

with my noble friend that providing one is alert enough to spot it a negative <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend the minister for having taken up what we did at report stage and for improving on the wording in a very small ways and otherwise doing very much the same thing <e> <s> if it would be for the convenience of your lordships i should like now to speak also to amendment no

cannot do that to modifying <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he had to say and for the fact that he clearly recognises the importance of the professional standing of opticians notwithstanding how their professional standing is being altered one cannot get away from it by the bill <e> <s> i hope that every effort will be made not only by my noble friend but by his colleagues in the department of health and social security to ensure that the high standing which has been achieved is not eroded in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw amendment

what the noble lord lord mishcon had to say i find satisfactory some not satisfactory <e> <s> that is something of a curates egg of a statement <e> <s> perhaps i may expand on it <e> <s> i think the complaint that was made that the other place put this in apparently without any argument is one to which my noble friend was referring earlier that we are unaccustomed to be the originators of a bill

particular provision to come in in the way that it has <e> <s> there have been occasions in this house when we have done that <e> <s> i would also suggest that the figure of million which was mentioned came through as the noble lord spoke as though it were a kind of gift <e> <s> however if you look closely at subsection you will see that it is to be borrowed <e> <s> i think that makes a difference <e> <s> the third point that i would make is that it would be very ponderous to set up an inquiry as suggested in the amendment <e>", "<cs> but if i may intervene if you borrow you have to

my noble friend has made and notwithstanding remarks made by noble lords opposite if we have the intelligence of the sort that my noble friend suggested we might have would it not be wise that if what

documents but perhaps do not have a shredder or if they have one it is out of action cannot burn that waste in peace or war if that is necessary <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> it is destruction that i am

noble friend is perhaps right to use persuasion rather than anything more forceful could he give us an indication of when he thinks local authorities will have achieved levels of the sort which he would consider acceptable in preparation for civil defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support in principle as a yachtsman what my noble friend has said because i think he is probably right

of the past five years to persuade them to think seriously about civil defence <e> <s> the fact that we reached the regulation was in large part due to the efforts of my noble friend lord renton <e>", "<cs> when they are defaulting my lords yes but the government might appoint a special person to do that though at local level <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is important <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support this amendment in principle though i agree that its wording could obviously be improved <e> <s> while supporting the explanation which the noble lord lord monson has given i should

what was the specification <e> <s> that would have helped them to improve their manufacture in the future so as to make themselves competitive in the world as my noble friend lord thorneycroft so

particular ploy has not helped manufacture in britain and i submit to your lordships is therefore still contrary to section <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the soviets have over a quarter of a million tonnes of chemical munitions is it not a matter of importance that we should have the report

even those noble lords who are against this measure with the possible exception of the noble lord lord porritt recognise that there have to be economies made in the national health service <e> <s> i believe we would all agree with that <e> <s> indeed i have said before in your lordships house that if economies are not made in the national health service it will gradually price itself out of

royal navy <e> <s> i suspect that in the days of samuel pepys when he was introduced to create just such economies in that service my predecessors in the royal navy were saying the same kind of thing

move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not make a speech now but perhaps my noble friend would hesitate before pursuing that line <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael raised the same point <e> <s> so far everybody has got wrong the amount of testing to be done by opticians <e> <s> i shall explain that when i wind up <e> <s> i did not explain this in my

misconceived what the whole thing is all about <e> <s> i think it will be easier if i deal first with one or two of the peripheral points and then at the end of what i have to say come to the main

do at this stage and not therefore repeat is to congratulate the government generally and my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth in particular on the skill with which he has been able to reflect the main thrust of what we were seeking to achieve with amendment no <e> <s> which we won so resoundingly at the committee stage earlier <e> <s> i think that my noble friend has done a jolly good job in

inappropriate on recommitment to have a second reading speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i support amendments nos <e> <s> and to so far as they go <e> <s> the inadequacies that i saw in them are reflected in my amendments nos <e> <s> and which we shall be dealing with next <e> <s> i am sure that there must have been a few jewels buried in the speech of the noble lord lord bruce of donington but it was

comment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his somewhat curates egg-like answer to us <e> <s> of course we shall study very carefully what he has said <e> <s> maybe if he does not feel that he

is what the noble lord lord benson has been telling us are laid before the court <e> <s> it also <e>", "<cs> if we are to have a hand in choosing the people in another place surely the logic of that is that they should have a hand in choosing us <e> <s> we are not going to do that and my noble friend said that this is a preliminary to any other change that might come about in the constitution of this house <e> <s> without such a change they do not have a hand in choosing us certainly not those of us who are hereditary <e> <s> that is done by a good god once the thing has started <e> <s> as to

on this matter at this stage unless one is going to look at the whole structure of the house <e> <s> i am not against that but it must come first <e> <s> i think that my noble friend is premature in putting forward his proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords in sharing this amendment with the noble lord lord benson who in my view made the case for it very well indeed i must confess that i found the comments by my noble friend the minister extremely disappointing <e> <s> he totally neglected to pick up the point which my noble friend if i may so describe him lord benson made and which other noble lords have made that we must be <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one or two remarks <e> <s> with this amendment to a greater extent than earlier amendments i have been advised by the cbi

the bill they said that they would do <e>", "<cs> my lords not having spoken before perhaps i may intervene for a moment <e> <s> it seems to me that if these amendments were taken to a division and were lost it would do the cause with which the house as a whole agrees harm rather than good <e> <s> if there is any doubt in the governments mind after they have had their consultations as to exactly how they might frame the amendment that my noble friend the minister has said he will definitely put down in another place if the consultations show a balance that is too even and this discussion we

their decision <e> <s> if on the other hand it is taken to a division and it is defeated and it is an even balance the government might not pay quite so much attention to what we have said in this house as they otherwise would <e>", "<cs> my lords i came in yesterday on amendment no <e> <s> and i do not want to repeat exactly what i said then <e> <s> but now after having heard the full argument

this whole package of amendments <e> <s> as i said in connection with amendment no <e> <s> there is a possibility that i may come forward with some refinement to improve the generosity of the

consideration when you can imagine all kinds of things that might have happened and which might not be reasonable at the time <e> <s> this seems to me a very moderate alternative way of putting this particular phrase <e> <s> i hope that the government can be generous and accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me i should like to say that one point that certainly did not occur to me until my noble friend the minister spoke is that the qualification in clause about step exists in subsection which makes a tremendous qualification of step <e> <s> the equivalent of subsection does not appear in clause <e> <s> that is a substantial modification and perhaps there is no need for this amendment or the ones that i put down at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords before

ilea is forecasting and which no doubt are reflected in the metropolitan county areas as well there will be a problem for the well established clubs <e> <s> they may find that they are reduced anyhow because of the competition of newly established charities <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for the way in which he has replied to this amendment <e> <s> i take fully the point that he makes about the need to delay real consideration of this matter until we get to clause <e> <s> with that in mind i would propose at this stage to withdraw the amendment but to speak again and separately to my amendment amendment no <e> <s> b when we come to that so as to reopen the subject at that stage <e> <s> i should like to have done it the other way around anyhow but the bill is written the way it is <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply which seems favourable <e> <s> is he aware that the nuts referred to in the question have to be bought outside the community because of their quality <e> <s> is he aware that over the past few years there has been difficulty in getting import duties on them reduced because of objections by italy <e> <s> will my noble friend please expand on the reasons for his obvious optimism in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords can we therefore expect that the government will be firm when the spaniards and the portuguese come to support the italians in making it more difficult or in hoping to make it more difficult for us to import and that they will make sure that changes do not come about except those which are favourable to united kingdom manufacturers <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down i should like to raise one matter <e> <s> in the first part of her speech she made a great point about the fact that if it were left to the boroughs they would not have the money <e> <s> i cannot see how the body suggested under amendment no <e> <s> zb will have any more money <e> <s> there does not seem to be any arrangements about it <e> <s> surely it will have to be funded through the boroughs <e> <s> therefore the totality of the money will be exactly the same <e>", "<cs> the noble lords opposite starting with the noble lord lord ennals seemed to pay no attention at all to the argument which impressed me greatly <e> <s> that was the argument of my noble friend lady carnegy about stability <e> <s> it is no good having funds provided if they are going to be turned over the next time the council changes <e> <s> stability is surely very important <e> <s> however not one of the noble lords or noble baronesses opposite gave any credibility at all to that <e> <s> i think that they are mistaken to ignore it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i should say that the particular youth clubs to which i was referring fall into three separate london boroughs and would be eligible under clause <e> <s> i am grateful for his reply and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we must be grateful to the noble lord lord pitt for introducing this debate <e> <s> my own misgiving is that he has introduced it in the form of the second reading of a <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be winding up and he can answer this point then <e> <s> otherwise with the greatest respect to the noble lord lord pitt he will be intervening in every speech which objects to what he is trying to say <e> <s> the noble lord can tell me at the end because he has the last word <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should point out to him that i am still thriving having smoked since i was and i have passed the stage at which my children are a great care to me <e> <s> none of my children smokes and i can think of not one friend in quite a long life who in his prime died from smoking <e> <s> i cannot think of anyone and i have a large number of friends <e> <s> i think that is just a myth <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i too welcome the broad principle of the intentions behind the bill <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble friend the minister on the clear manner in which she explained the bill to us <e> <s> i have to declare an interest in that i am advised by the cake and biscuit alliance and by the confederation of british industry to whom i am formally a parliamentary adviser <e> <s> i have also been advised by the engineering employers federation and by other bodies <e> <s> i wish to mention three particular matters of concern all of which have been touched <e>", "<cs> my lords i also spoke in favour of it <e>", "<cs> my lords almost for the first time in this house it is a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord hatch as in the earlier part of his speech he took us around the countryside mostly to places which i have visited <e> <s> i was entirely with him and i loved every minute of the journey he described to us <e> <s> i did not quite like the end but that will become clear as i proceed with my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i am about to finish <e> <s> the noble lord can speak when i sit down <e> <s> as my noble friend the minister said in introducing the bill the customer can now have better and more services and better value for money with more operators providing greater transport variety at competitive prices <e> <s> that is the aim of the bill <e> <s> i do not see any reason whatsoever why it should not achieve that aim <e> <s> i trust therefore that we shall not muck it about at committee stage and spoil it <e> <s> i hope your lordships will take that view right through all stages of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we could go on with very long speeches but there are a lot of people to speak <e> <s> in my part of the world we have large double-decker buses on rural routes <e> <s> in the winter time and in all the months except for half of june july and august <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships will allow me this will be the last intervention the answer is that because it is one operator in virtually a monopoly position he has to look at it from that point of view <e> <s> but if there were several operators some of them would provide small buses for the winter others would provide extra small buses for some of the summer and you would not only have to have big buses because you had to deal with the summer traffic <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down and before i attempt to deal with this may i ask him two questions <e> <s> the first is that it seems to me that in amendment no <e> <s> c which he will move later the residuary body requires the agreement of the districts for what i would describe as the interim survival of trading standards at the local government level at which we seek to achieve it <e> <s> the first question is is it right that the residuary body requires agreement <e> <s> my second question is am i right in looking at paragraph of schedule to think that this does not require the retention of the schemes established at metropolitan levels <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite right and i thank my noble friend for the answer that he has given <e> <s> the second question was that in paragraph of schedule there seems to be no requirement or obligation for the retention of the teams that are currently established at metropolitan county level <e>", "<cs> my lords that last point is vital <e> <s> i have listened with great care to all that has been said and i should like just to make a couple of remarks before i come to a conclusion <e> <s> i take serious issue with my noble friend the minister though to a lesser extent than i do with my noble friends lord campbell of alloway and lord boyd-carpenter that these amendments are contrary to the spirit of the bill <e> <s> but i do take their point that my amendment is very much spoiled by the existence of amendments nos <e> <s> and za <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a benefit <e> <s> regarding amendment no <e> <s> za can we kill that too <e> <s> i do not think i am getting any response <e> <s> the most interesting speech and perhaps the briefest was that of the noble and learned lord lord denning in which he said he was totally convinced one way when i spoke earlier and then he was convinced with others the other way when my noble friend the minister spoke <e> <s> i hope very much that i might be able to sway him back again now because if you can sway one way you can sway the other <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank my noble friend very much for his further reassurances on points that were still disturbing me when we dealt with the first amendment <e> <s> i should like to think that these will be read with great care by all people concerned and that as nearly as possible we can achieve the ends which i think we all want <e> <s> i thank him very much for them <e>", "<cs> my lords in saying that he would not move this amendment the noble lord lord rochester mentioned amendment no <e> <s> ac <e> <s> i have put my name to that amendment <e> <s> i agree with it in principle and i was hoping for a nice lively debate perhaps with a decent government statement to explain what they are doing in this respect <e> <s> from what the noble lord has said i am not quite clear because when he sat down he said firmly that he was not moving amendment no <e> <s> aa <e> <s> does that include amendment no <e> <s> ac or shall i have to move that myself when we come to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the first part of the amendment calling on the secretary of state to make the relevant order quickly <e> <s> in fact i hope that my noble friend when he comes to reply might indicate that such a regulation will be made in even less than two months to make sure that the uncertainties around this whole point as mentioned by many noble lords are reduced to a minimum <e> <s> although seeing the sense of what the noble lord lord rochester says about the need for equality of compensation i find it difficult on reading the amendment to equate that with benefits significantly greater <e> <s> if benefits are significantly greater they are surely less equal <e> <s> i do not quite understand that <e> <s> the noble lord can perhaps explain exactly what this means when he concludes the discussion on this amendment unless of course my noble friend when he speaks explains it <e> <s> or perhaps another noble lord may explain it <e> <s> to that extent i support the first part but cannot support the amendment as a whole because i do not believe that the latter part really makes sense <e>", "<cs> at second reading my noble friend the minister declared both in her opening and in her closing speech that the government were open-minded about the need for a register such as would be set up under schedule for which this is the paving clause <e> <s> i am questioning whether having heard what was said on second reading and any other points that may have been brought to their notice the government have considered whether there really is a need for this register and registrar <e> <s> having read the social security pensions act it seems to me that if there is a need for some sort of supervisory body of the nature of the registrar the occupational pensions board may have its activities slightly increased <e> <s> but to go into the whole business of setting up what schedule proposes seems to me to be a rather cumbersome and unnecessary job <e> <s> if the government do not respond to this point i have tabled amendments which i hope we shall discuss separately later when we come to them but not now <e> <s> my real point is that we should get rid of this altogether and i hope that the government when they say they are open-minded are open-minded enough to do just that <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that my noble friend has fully satisfied me i do not know about my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i hope that when my noble friend considers this little debate she will pay particular care to what was said by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter when he warned the government particularly this government not to have yet another bureaucratic system which basically they are against having not to set up an expensive new outfit which is not perhaps wholly necessary <e>", "<cs> this is not quite clear to me and perhaps the noble lord lord banks can explain it <e> <s> it seems to me that his amendment no <e> <s> will sweep away the employers contribution altogether <e> <s> alternatively does that mean that it stays as it is now with no change at all <e>", "<cs> but is the noble lord not taking away from page line new subsections d e and f <e> <s> does not that sweep away what the bill is proposing or am i being very dull <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend very much for his very full comment on my amendment <e> <s> perhaps i should have said earlier that i have worded it in the form of <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has not taken up my point about comparison between deferred pensions and pensions in payment nor indeed those of current employees <e> <s> i honestly think that i have not had an answer to this point either at second reading or now <e> <s> it is not an adequate explanation to say that the occupational pensions board thinks that this is a good figure because there is a very valid point here which companies need to have answered <e> <s> i should have said when i moved this amendment but did not because we were rattling along that in moving amendment no <e> <s> i was also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am deeply grateful to both the noble lord lord banks and the noble baroness lady turner and at last to my noble friend the minister because i really did not have a satisfactory explanation either at second reading or on our first encounter on these amendments but i now see that there is a very good point to this <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> two points from my noble friends remarks strike me <e> <s> one is that she said considerable support was given to many documents as listed currently in the bill <e> <s> can she enlarge on that and say where the considerable support comes from and if it is not immediately available to her can she perhaps let me know in a letter <e> <s> i ask this because it could be that the considerable support comes from the very sources against which protection ought to be provided <e> <s> it is difficult to know <e> <s> as my noble friend said my amendment would enable an individual who was personally concerned because of a pension or possible pensions if he went to work for a company to go only to the people who were providing the pension scheme which is exactly what i want to achieve <e> <s> that would seem to me to be perfectly all right for my individual friend <e> <s> i think perhaps the considerable support might come from people who would derive other benefits from being able to get at this information and would not help the person we want to help who is the potential pensioner <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend say that it will be before report stage <e> <s> i must press her on this because i think that that would be a matter of considerable importance <e> <s> if at report stage my noble friend comes up with an amendment which is perhaps on the lines of that which i have that is fine and we can forget about it <e> <s> however if she does not come up with one we have to do it at third reading and by the rules of the house it would not be proper for me to go into battle on third reading <e> <s> furthermore if the outcome at third reading is that her amendment which she then puts down is not good enough we will not have time to correct it because we are the second chamber taking this bill <e> <s> thus it is very important that a conclusion is reached before report stage <e>", "<cs> yes that is fine <e> <s> there is just one final point <e> <s> what i sought to convey to the committee when i introduced this amendment was that we have many facts here which are open to any person and i turn again to page line <e> <s> perhaps when my noble friend is considering any amendment she may have she will bear in mind that that term is very wide indeed <e> <s> one may think that the term any person will invite all kinds of trouble <e> <s> therefore perhaps my noble friend may care to think about that <e> <s> having made that point <e>", "<cs> i am assured that the point is taken <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is difficult to agree with a fair amount of what my noble friend has said <e> <s> as regards the point about my amendment significantly reducing the governments opportunities to encourage employment in the lower level i fear and i said this also on second reading that without my amendment that could be the outcome in many of the companies which matter namely the companies which are earning the money for us <e> <s> that is something of which the government really must take account instead of producing arguments against it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord crawshaw on his splendid maiden speech <e> <s> indeed as is sometimes not the case with maiden speakers he has sat here almost uninterruptedly to listen to the rest of the debate <e> <s> it is a wonderful start and i hope he will often illuminate our discussions with his contributions <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it is necessary to have this amendment or these amendments to achieve the purpose that the noble lord lord shepherd has rightly said is very important namely to make sure that maintenance is of a high quality <e> <s> if you compare the wording as it stands and how it would stand even i can work that out for myself without being helped by the noble lord lord tordoff about the only significant difference is the question of reporting annually to parliament <e> <s> if you are intending to have the secretary of state reporting annually to parliament it has to be remembered that the secretary of state is responsible for all sorts of things quite as important as the maintenance of buses <e> <s> you might just as well say that he has to report on all those too <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the leader of the house aware that i would strongly support an interim report <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems that while we are making this bill do now pass speeches at this stage i may briefly contribute <e> <s> i was amused by the crocodile tears of the noble lord lord stallard <e> <s> they reminded me of being on the back-benches in opposition luckily several years ago now <e> <s> one used to make that kind of speech with tears practically pouring down the gangways <e> <s> it makes it all sound so dreadful but his closing remarks were so much the reverse of the truth that no doubt my noble friend will be picking it up <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i hope that the government pay very special regard to the points that i raised both at second reading and at committee stage and will keep a sharp eye open to make quite certain that the various policies they seek to give effect to in this bill go the way they think they should and that they will make the necessary changes if they do not <e> <s> the most important thing that they must do is to ensure that industry and that includes the employees in industry receive the maximum benefit that they can from this bill so that they can help the country as a whole <e> <s> if i can be reassured on that point i shall be happy to see this bill go on to royal assent <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord <e>", "<cs> bearing in mind what my noble friend the minister has said and also the gist if i have understood it correctly of the contribution of the noble lord lord ennals i question whether the noble lord is being entirely wise in being about to suggest to the committee that we should insert the amendments in the bill now <e> <s> in view of what my noble friend has said a great many of us thought that he had gone quite as far as could be expected at this stage <e> <s> therefore it is highly likely that these amendments will be defeated and that surely would not be in the best interests of the elderly and the disabled <e> <s> it would create the impression that what my noble friend is saying as regards the amendments which he will bring forward later and which will reflect the view of the house is somehow denigrated in advance by the defeat of these amendments <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be most unwise to put these amendments to the committee at this stage <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord tordoff as i said earlier i think it was at second reading surprises me by his rigid adherence to the importance of regulation and control and making sure that everybody is told what to do and prevented from getting on to new things <e> <s> that is so strange speaking from the bench that he does <e> <s> i think that the rather vaguely damning with faint praise approach is irrelevant to this particular bill <e>", "<cs> paragraphs <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lord brabazon replies one point that my noble friend made which i think contradicts the theme of what the noble lord lord mcintosh said of which i saw the force is that subsection states if a traffic authority asks him <e> <s> so the initiation comes from the democratically elected body and then the traffic commissioner acts as an impartial authority for putting it into effect <e> <s> i should have thought that that was the right balance and a much better balance than sweeping away the intervention because it is not quite like that <e> <s> it is not a middle-man situation <e> <s> so i really think that the noble lord might like to think about that <e>", "<cs> it is not a possibility <e> <s> it is a requirement that the traffic authority as the bill is written initiates this action <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene to suggest to the noble lord that to swan into the end of a debate pick up a single phrase and start teasing it just to pursue his little argument when we have been here concentrating on this amendment for minutes is outside the keepings of how the committee behaves according to my understanding <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will allow us to get on with the amendment <e>", "<cs> thank goodness for that <e>", "<cs> the amendment seems a very sensible one to me <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i am per cent <e> <s> pleased but i have exactly the same reservations as the noble lord lord shepherd <e> <s> i shall read what my noble friend has said to both me and the noble lord lord shepherd and reserve the right to come back on report if i am not happy <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it is not peculiar to the bbc to have these emotive propaganda films and that independent television for example screened an emotive film on the very evening before the cnd greenham womens mass demonstration on th december <e> <s> is it not most unhelpful to the country to have these propaganda films screened by these public television companies <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that some three years ago i had occasion on behalf of the small businessman to ask the government whether the pieces of paper he had to fill in when he expanded his business from being run by his wife and himself to hiring an outside employee could be reduced <e> <s> will my noble friends new scheme reduce the number of forms which have to be filled in in particular those originating from the inland revenue <e>", "<cs> let me just take up one point that the noble earl lord winchilsea raised <e> <s> he said that there would be an immediate rush for applications <e> <s> one had a vision of the town halls being bombarded with people <e> <s> i cannot believe that that will be the situation <e> <s> if there is a rush it will be by people who have assessed the market and see that there is a need for taxis <e> <s> as my noble friend lady carnegy said if people have to pay a large sum for a licence that means that there are not enough taxis <e> <s> that is a natural situation <e> <s> i cannot believe that there will be more people applying for licences than the market will bear and so there will not be a dramatic change <e>", "<cs> well hurry up and get on with it <e> <s> it is an unnecessary extra speech <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down was he totally deaf when my noble friend lord nugent made his speech <e> <s> it seems to me that he must not have listened to him at all <e>", "<cs> it appeared to me that my noble friend lord nugent provided a complete counter-argument to what the noble lord lord mcintosh has just been saying <e>", "<cs> my noble friend certainly managed to bring his criticism of hereford into an area which is not affected by the part of the bill which affects the out-of-town towns <e> <s> i agree in principle with what the noble lord lord ezra is talking about but with a great reservation <e> <s> the noble lord lord strabolgi mentioned tourism <e> <s> i am not sure that we are not committed to this because we are so popular and our tourists must come to central london in order to look at us <e> <s> we have to endure this for only two or three months of the year <e>", "<cs> well i am sorry i come here every day whenever parliament is sitting from pimlico which is as close as one can be though not as close as my noble friend who can walk and does not even have to motor <e> <s> thus i know exactly what the problem is <e> <s> however that is not the point about this amendment <e> <s> it is reflecting an instinctive reaction which might be misdirected because we have to look at the wider issue of whether we want to have all these americans running about in our streets bringing in and spending lots of money <e>", "<cs> i added my name to the amendment of the noble lord lord banks because my views on this matter are similar to those put forward by the noble lord and by my noble friend lord gridley and indeed by practically every noble lord who has spoken <e> <s> i have no wish to repeat all the statements that have been made already <e>", "<cs> so far as i am concerned it does <e>", "<cs> i understand precisely what the noble lord has been saying but what worries me are the words <e>", "<cs> not true <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to intervene i was talking about potential users <e> <s> those are the people we want to get at <e>", "<cs> i am indeed grateful to my noble friend and thank him for his reassurances which seem to me to be absolutely splendid <e> <s> i shall consult the isle of wight county council and if they see some snag i <e>", "<cs> i have no knowledge of what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> i do not think it is very likely without going into a little geography <e> <s> i think perhaps the noble lord does not have quite the right message there <e> <s> i take his point notwithstanding <e> <s> but i do not think that that particular case is relevant <e>", "<cs> there is one small point <e> <s> i do not understand why the noble lord does not take my noble friends point that clause meets his requirements <e> <s> the more i read that the more it seems to answer everything that the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment but i have to declare an interest <e> <s> at my great age i have a concessionary fare on the boats from the isle of wight to the mainland and i should hate to see that withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said that in another place our right honourable friend gave special concessions for the scottish islands <e> <s> will my noble friend agree to consider that in all fairness the same kind of approach should be given to the english islands <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies and i have not had a chance to speak yet may i say that to begin with i was sympathetic to the thought of recommittal but i am not sure that this is right and i think a great deal is being demanded <e> <s> a great deal was made of the fact that the notes on clauses came out only last weekend <e> <s> it is only very recently that we have had notes on clauses <e> <s> i have been through bills on which this very thing has happened and i have been through bills when in opposition on which this very thing has happened and we have grumbled like mad <e> <s> admittedly we have not had what has just taken place in this chamber and which has added to the time <e> <s> but before now i have been arguing until after midnight about this sort of thing and i think we are making a great issue of it <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not think it is illogical that the directive retains a special position for primary agricultural products which in fact are being given special treatment <e> <s> would it not have been more sensible to have a similar treatment for all food products at whatever stage they came <e> <s> will it not be to the disadvantage of consumers that when they consume primary agricultural products they will have less protection than when they consume processed products <e> <s> is that not illogical and would it not have been better to have had that eliminated from the directive <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can he help the committee in one respect <e> <s> i listened with great care to his splendid explanation of the situation as he saw it <e> <s> as i understood him the noble lord was saying that if the governments proposals are accepted then the people who are not at the moment pensioned those who will be pensioned in the future will be deprived of superior benefits <e> <s> however i did not receive any indication from the noble lords remarks of what are the superior benefits that such people would be denied <e> <s> can he clarify that point <e>", "<cs> i understand what the noble lord has just said but he has not really answered my question <e> <s> what are the benefits which the members will be deprived of <e> <s> what are the superior benefits which they would reasonably expect <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord speaking of financial benefits or benefits in kind such as the sum which a widow would receive and so on <e> <s> or is it just the ability of the trustees to pay the members the kind of income that they could otherwise be expected to pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to support strongly what my noble friend lord nugent has just said <e> <s> it is not only true that my noble friend lord belstead in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> in committee made it quite clear that all the benefits of the present system will be retained it is also the case that the governments new proposals will give an opportunity for improving it <e> <s> after all deregulated buses in proper competition will surely provide what is necessary more accurately and better than the cost benefit analysis which is proposed in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords one point that puzzles me about this amendment and about the remarks just made by the noble lord lord mcintosh is that it is being argued that if one does not like a particular piece of legislation one can introduce into it a clause which will enable that legislation to be reversed quite easily <e>", "<cs> my lords is unmet a proper english word <e> <s> would not better wording be which is not met <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the principle of this amendment though i quite understand and agree with my noble friend who has just spoken about the shortcomings of the amendment as it stands <e> <s> i speak really from the point of view of people on the isle of wight who suffer from having a monopoly operator <e> <s> i have noted that the noble lord lord shepherd said that on the whole operators might be at a disadvantage if this amendment were to be accepted <e> <s> it is for that kind of reason that i support the principle of it because i foresee that there could be situations in which the operator particularly if he starts from the advantage of a monopoly position could manipulate matters and he might indeed be able to bamboozle a county council into taking actions which may be uneconomic actions which it would not particularly want to do if it were better skilled at business matters <e> <s> in the nature of things county councillors and their officials are not businessmen because they are not paid to be businessmen and officials in an organisation do not know such things <e> <s> it could well be that in the early stages when this act is working itself through there will be occasions when people might take decisions at county council level which will not be to the advantage of their financial position nor therefore of their ratepayers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for having made this move <e> <s> i know that the isle of wight will be particularly pleased to see this amendment made <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene very briefly with one further point <e> <s> i am much taken with the recommendation of my noble friend lord onslow <e> <s> the cbi who advise me as your lordships know are of the opinion that this bill should go through now regardless <e> <s> i am therefore not speaking for them <e> <s> but i should like to remind the house that one of the most successful bills of a non-political nature which originated in this chamber in recent years was the data protection bill which fortuitously was stopped because of the election in <e> <s> that bill had gone a long way right through this house and halfway through the other place and many of the views that had been expressed had not been properly encompasssed by the government department <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord lord bruce said at enormous length made good sense but the english of his amendment being put into the amendment of the commons does not strike me as <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend happy that the areas on which food from britain concentrates both in europe and north america are the best ones particularly for processed foods <e> <s> would it not be better if it had an office in the middle east where there is a new market to be developed rather than operating in markets that are already well established <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add my congratulations to my three noble friends who have made their maiden speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of saint albans upon what i though was not only a humorously introduced maiden speech which showed great quality but also a moving description of the problems of the mentally handicapped <e>

of what we had all said and doing it all in barely over minutes quite remarkable <e> <s> i hope that all front-bench speakers old and new will take example from this in the future <e> <s> if i may i should like to take up what one might almost call a dissident point with the noble lord lord ennals who invited me to comment further on the matter that i raised with him <e> <s> i apologise for not having wrtten to him but i have here the programme of the conference that he chaired last week <e> <s> i must confess that the titles of the subjects spoken about frighten me <e> <s> it seemed to be a conference more on the politics of civil liberties than on care for the mentally disabled <e> <s> perhaps we may leave it at that at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that it is most unfortunate that there should be many worthy doctors in the world who are misled by the soviet disinformation services particularly observing what my noble friend lady cox pointed out in her question <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate my noble friend lord campbell of alloway on introducing this debate <e> <s> i have been concerned for some time and i was particularly interested in what my noble friend lord renton had to say about the way in which the practice of having codes of practice has increased so tremendously in the past years or so <e> <s> that has been more and more obvious and one has become more and more concerned that somehow these codes of practice were growing like topsy and not growing in any orderly way <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like very much to thank the noble lord lord gallacher for introducing this most interesting and timely debate <e> <s> i must apologise to your lordships and in particular to the noble lord lord gallacher and to my noble friend on the front bench who will wind up because i have a long-standing engagement and may have to go a little early but as we are getting on so fast perhaps it will not be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that industry year and i welcome the governments great support for it is really the start of a campaign to get industry and engineering properly appreciated in this country and that it is not just a one-off one-year event <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will support me in that view <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to follow the noble lord lord chalfont after his most impressive speech one of many such speeches but a particularly good one <e> <s> i shall have to apologise to my noble friend the minister and indeed to the later speakers because i may not be able to stay to the end of the debate owing to a long-standing engagement <e> <s> i am extremely sorry for that because it has been a very good debate so far albeit perhaps rather lengthy <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down will she perhaps explain to us how this amendment will help the voluntary organisations and how it is that if the amendment is not carried the voluntary organisations will suffer <e> <s> it does not seem to me that this part of the bill and the general sense of what we are talking about has any bearing on the voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly support my noble friends amendment in principle <e> <s> i am not quite sure that the wording meets exactly what he argues <e> <s> i hope that perhaps my noble friend on the front bench can explain to us why this provision was withdrawn in another place and whether he has something more cogent to go in its place <e>", "<cs> when a lawyer is giving advice surely he does not refer to only one act of parliament that is relevant to the matter <e> <s> if the particular material relates to race relations then surely the lawyer will refer to the race relations act as much as to the provisions of this bill when it becomes an act <e> <s> he will take the whole of the legal advice in the round <e>", "<cs> it is only to say that the noble lord is making a tremendous labour over this <e> <s> does the noble lord have to go on and go on wandering around his subject <e> <s> can he not come to a point <e> <s> having listened to what has been said it seems to me that there are quite a lot of matters of this nature going into the detail is splitting hairs and one or two of the other amendments are similar which might come into the code of practice the subject of a later clause rather than be dealt with here <e>", "<cs> i would briefly say that i shall come to this subject from a different point of view in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is another one again <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e> <s> i said it was the function of the member of parliament to represent <e>", "<cs> that is a splendid undertaking and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i draw just one thing to his attention <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> as opposed to amendments nos <e> <s> or seeks to add a new subsection which relates particularly to parish and community councils <e> <s> it might be possible to amend subsection in such a way as to encompass everyone elses opinions and have another subsection which deals with local councils <e> <s> i merely put that in my noble friends mind <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not understand why the noble baroness should think that my noble friends amendment would be any better in what we can say and what we can do than would be the ministers amendment <e> <s> in both cases we can adopt as strong a position as we can and sometimes ministers pay attention and withdraw orders to amend them and lay them again <e> <s> that has happened within the past year <e> <s> it does not make any difference whether it is under the negative or affirmative procedure <e> <s> i do not think that the rhodesia incident is one which can be called a real precedent it was a very special case <e> <s> it is about the only one that has happened in the time that i have been in the house which is nearly years <e>", "<cs> i should like to add to the words of my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls with which i entirely agree the fact that as i see it the amendment as worded applies to all bodies representative of employees of local authorities whereas i think that the noble lord lord ardwick was really making a plea for the nuj in particular <e> <s> i think that what my noble friend lord campbell had in mind is that this amendment as worded covers all the trades unions of all the employees of the local authority which is really going much too far for a matter which is particularly concerned with publicity <e> <s> in any case i agree with the arguments that my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls has made that the trades unions are not responsible for publicity but it is the responsibility of the local authorities and it is the responsible people who need to be consulted in the usual way <e> <s> it happens in lots of bills <e> <s> this is a very special case <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment is calling upon the subordinate bodies public bodies and voluntary organisations which receive this money to make public their own accounts <e> <s> we are not seeking to add to what the local authorities have to do <e> <s> that is why <e>", "<cs> yes i can see the problem <e> <s> it needs something as comprehensive even to cover the narrow gap of publicity <e> <s> of course i covered publicity because that is the nature of part ii of the bill and it is the nature of the title of clause <e>", "<cs> well with that almost reassurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak to my amendment as well and answer most of the points raised by the noble and learned lord lord silkin <e> <s> i appreciate that he has been an attorney-general and therefore knew a lot about what that involved <e>", "<cs> my lords what sanctions does my noble friends right honourable friend have in the event that people do not respond <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the position referred to by the noble lord lord mishcon caused by those authorities who have taken this firm stand against civil defence and equated it completely with nuclear war which is really not the point of it at all <e> <s> we are talking about nuclear protection in peace and <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that when i had the privilege of commanding hms ajax i took her away from cammell laird who were the builders <e> <s> they were then under private ownership and made a first-class job of building that ship <e> <s> but is my noble friend also aware that at that stage some years ago there were already signs that there was no proper cohesion between the management and the workforce which later became more obvious and that the opportunity of having a consortium which is owned by the workforce and the management would be wholly beneficial in this case <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i may say that he really is over-exaggerating his case <e> <s> he puts this argument together with the example of sunday working and the distributive trades which are quite different from manufacturing <e> <s> in effect he is seeking to place a restriction on people adopting new practices in order to keep up with new methods of manufacturing <e> <s> this matter does not relate specifically to night working <e> <s> the noble lords amendment no <e> <s> which i take to be the key amendment is generalising very much from the particular <e> <s> i would have thought that it represents an old-fashioned walking back into earlier centuries a sort of luddite approach is governing the thinking behind this amendment <e> <s> it is purely hampering for british industry which must become more effective <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that this amendment and many of the others which relate to clause and which are all on the same lines might not be thought necessary if i interpret what the noble baroness lady seear says correctly provided there is protection in a broader sense which is not industrially harmful <e> <s> though noble lords laughed when i spoke last i am sure that everybody will agree that the industrial success of this country must underline everything to do with industrial work <e> <s> we must not forget that at any stage <e>", "<cs> i still do not quite understand what the noble baroness is trying to say <e> <s> she is saying that women and men should be more equal and that we should get rid of things which make them different <e> <s> she also says that my noble friend is sweeping away wholesale sections of the factories act <e> <s> it seems to me that there has been a very modest encroachment of what is in the factories act in certain selected areas and it is not a wholesale sweeping away <e> <s> indeed a great deal of thought has obviously gone into deciding just exactly what is reasonable to repeal and what is not reasonable to repeal in order to bring a greater equality between men and women and in order to allow women if they wish to do the type of work which men have been doing where that is reasonable <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might be allowed to add to what my noble friend said <e> <s> reading the noble lords amendment it strikes me that whereas it may be although that is pressing it a lot he has logic behind him in continuing his argument about section of the factories act being repeated as it were on a wider scale and that in subsection of this clause he has an outside of a point surely he is being a little greedy in his amendment to include subsection of clause which purely relates to an administrative process exercised by the secretary of state the relevant sections already having been voted into existence by parliament if that is relevant <e> <s> therefore it seems to me that the noble lord has spoiled his amendment by being over-ambitious quite apart from the very sound arguments of my noble friend the minister <e>", "<cs> i said subsection of clause which the noble lord includes in his amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to take issue with the noble baroness on one small point which is her suggestion that this proposal is brand new and has been thrust upon people and that we should have more time for discussion <e> <s> discussions about this matter have been continuing on and off both unofficially and sometimes officially <e> <s> i had the privilege of being the employers secretary for the joint industrial council for the biscuit industry for some years during the last decade and from time to time we discussed this very point <e> <s> because we had a collective agreement which effectively pre-empted the need for that particular act there was really no need to make a great fuss about it <e> <s> at that time also there was no real suggestion that there were women in large numbers who wanted to work at night <e> <s> i have since found rather interestingly that there are rather more than one ever thought who do want to work at night <e> <s> so that is a new factor which changes the situation <e>", "<cs> certainly there have been parts of the biscuit baking industry which have sought to have it abolished but they have not made a great issue of it <e> <s> we have had a perfectly good collective agreement through the jic so there has been no need to make a great issue of it <e> <s> on the other hand there has not been suitable legislation on which to tag it and it does not deserve a bill of its own <e> <s> when now confronted with the fact that the ladies want to be treated just like the men which is a new idea which has been growing in recent years it provides an opportunity for sizing up the situation <e> <s> all my colleagues in the biscuit industry whom i do not now serve directly in the way that i used to do are delighted with the legislation as it stands and welcome very much clause of the bill <e> <s> perhaps that answers the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> the noble lord carries himself away as though this were a great theatrical performance <e> <s> this is not so <e> <s> it is nonsense to say that the employers do not back the government <e> <s> the employers do back the government <e> <s> noble lords opposite forget that the act came about quite soon after the war when the old methods of manufacture were still in use <e> <s> there has been a great change in the baking of biscuits and also in the making of bread <e> <s> there are more preservatives there is much less need for night work than there ever was in the s <e> <s> as a result because it is more expensive to have night work the amount of night work is at the minimum that the companies can reasonably afford <e> <s> the whole pattern is nothing like it was when the foundations for the act were created <e> <s> it will become more so rather than less so <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that his remarks are most encouraging <e> <s> can he give us some idea of when he is going to be able to extend the scheme more widely because it seems to be an excellent plan for a very necessary problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that my noble friend lady faithfull should speak in those terms because i feel that she has not seen the depth of what is behind all this <e> <s> i commend particularly the speech of the noble lord lord grimond who presented all the doubts that one has about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord lord denning for what he has said <e> <s> i wish he had said that as firmly in his initial speech because that would have been helpful <e> <s> i am not at all happy with the response that i have had from my noble and learned friend <e> <s> with the greatest possible respect i do not think he took up the points which i made specifically and i am very disappointed indeed that he did not take the very point that the noble and learned lord lord denning has just made <e> <s> i am also sad because he did not seem to me to answer the points which were much more intellectually advanced by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> i would have hoped that we could have had a much more positive response <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not quite good enough <e> <s> however what i will do if i may is to discuss matters with my noble friends and see whether the noble lord lord harris and the noble and learned lord lord denning might like to join with us <e> <s> perhaps we could see whether we could come up with something which masters the points quite justifiably levelled at my amendment <e> <s> perhaps we could try that out on my noble and learned friend during the next four or five days i shall do that whether he likes it or not <e> <s> i now beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to say thank you very much to my noble friend the minister for carrying out in his amendment no <e> <s> that which he promised he would in relation to my amendment in committee <e> <s> although his amendment is not quite as good as we would have liked it is very nearly there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little puzzled that voluntary organisations should think that they cannot publicise anything because really all they are being prevented from publicising is what is in clause and many of the things they want to talk about have no relation to politics at all <e> <s> i am advised that the difference between amendment no <e> <s> and the existing wording of the bill is that clever people who want to exploit the situation and defeat clause could do it much more readily under amendment no <e> <s> than they could under the bill as it stands <e> <s> therefore from the point of view of the bills main object with which we are all agreed it would be better if we did not go ahead with this amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i too attended the meeting in oxford to which she referred for its morning session <e> <s> is she also aware that when one of the speakers said that before people are discharged from hospital it must be ensured that there are adequate facilities for receiving them into the community particularly when their families cannot take them this received prolonged clapping <e> <s> i understand that this might mean further legislation <e> <s> would my noble friend give consideration to such legislation being introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with a tiny bit of what the noble baroness said <e> <s> i shall not speak in detail on this amendment which i strongly support because <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to support this amendment and to continue from where my noble friend lord sandford has just ended <e> <s> my noble friend the minister very splendidly put down amendment no <e> <s> at report stage and it was accepted by your lordships <e> <s> it gave effect to his undertaking to pay regard to my amendment amendment no <e> <s> at the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be very dumb but i do not understand why this is necessary in view of the fact that the common council of the city of london comes under clause <e>", "<cs> surely the great thing about a computer is that it does not matter where it is located if you operate one it is the terminal equipment that matters <e> <s> it is understandable that the cutlers want to keep the link which they had previously but it can be only a tenuous link now that we have moved on from quill pens and large registers which no doubt was the position when they started <e> <s> even the cutlers if they were given a particular task in this area may not want to have the computer in sheffield it may be more convenient for them to have it somewhere else in the country <e> <s> it seems to me that this particular amendment is not wholly suited for the type of purpose which the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has advanced <e> <s> there may be some other way of retaining a link apart from trying to locate the computer in a particular place <e> <s> that does not seem to me to be appropriate whatever courses we may consider for retaining the longstanding historical connections of the company of cutlers <e>", "<cs> i hope that when my noble friend replies from the front bench he or she will give great consideration to this amendment including the abolition of clause <e> <s> there have been one or two points made and i would not dream of adding to them because i have great sympathy with what has been said except for the total ridiculousness and the shame in a bill before us of subsection <e>", "<cs> my noble friend the minister said that this was a lawyers point because my noble friend lord renton kindly came to my assistance <e> <s> it is not a lawyers point but a management point it is a very important management point <e> <s> to say that two out of three may decide without declaring which are the most important of the three could cause managerial chaos <e>", "<cs> we do not have that paper <e>", "<cs> in this day and age surely most if not all of the governors names would be in the telephone book <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord gallacher for his introduction <e> <s> i nearly called the noble lord my noble friend because he is such a splendid chairman of our sub-committee <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble and learned lord lord templeman for his introduction to his outgoers scheme which to me is much less easy to understand <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for explaining it so clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly to say that those who advise me principally the business equipment trade association are very keen that this bill should go through unchanged as quickly as possible <e> <s> my noble friend the minister said that the amendments now before us would have the danger of perhaps turning the bill into a contentious one <e> <s> not only would they not be in accord with what i have just advanced as the view of many people but also they might endanger the bill itself <e> <s> that would be most unfortunate and i hope therefore that the noble lord lord northfield will be convinced by my noble friend the minister and will not wish to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords following on from what the noble lord lord crawshaw said is my noble friend aware that the allocation for the west region of the national federation of housing associations is per cent <e> <s> less this year compared with last year and that the isle of wight in which i have particular interest is per cent <e> <s> less <e> <s> i do not mean down by per cent <e> <s> but per cent <e> <s> of last years total <e> <s> is that not too dramatic a decrease <e> <s> i take my noble friends point about the overall housing programme but with what are to a large extent voluntary organisations although some are more organised than others is it not reasonable for them to have a much greater amount than they have been promised this year and something nearer to last year rather than the sum being down to under one-third <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to her earlier remarks perhaps i should tell the noble baroness that concerning the most unfortunate cases of maltreatment within the family the nspcc with which i have the privilege of being associated is building up its facilities for studying this all the time <e> <s> in certain areas it is working jointly with the local authority <e> <s> there is a tremendous amount of work going on to identify the problems about which she spoke <e>", "<cs> my lords following on my noble friends remarks in answer to the last question is the minister aware that when i was director of the distributive industry training board particular efforts were made to keep the bureaucracy to a minimum and we were largely successful in doing that <e> <s> but the main question that i want to put to him is this do his initial remarks about the fact that we are not good enough apply equally to management training <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord de la warr <e> <s> the reply was disappointing <e> <s> we required greater support for my noble friend lady cox <e> <s> it is all very well to say that there may be people who are qualified but there needs to be a statutory element to support what my noble friend was saying <e> <s> whether the clause is right whether it needs changing is another matter <e> <s> what we are pleading for is a statutory endorsement of what my noble friend the minister is saying is there anyhow because i do not believe that it is everywhere it should be <e> <s> that is the sort of thing we want <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady masham for so clearly introducing the bill <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the bills sponsors in another place for so painstakingly bringing it so far <e> <s> i welcome the bill in principle <e> <s> the right reverend prelate the bishop of gloucester who has just spoken expressed more clearly than i can much of why i do so <e> <s> it has been a privilege to follow him <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in sympathy with the theme behind the noble lords amendments but not with the detail <e> <s> therefore i cannot agree with the actual amendments as they stand <e> <s> it seems to me that the rigour of these numbers which are allocated perhaps leaves not enough flexibility and it is the co-opted governors who presumably provide the flexibility <e> <s> there is no doubt that in my part of the world the sort of governorship which has been working very well for a long time would be imbalanced by the figures that are listed in the bill and would be further imbalanced by the figures listed in the amendments of the noble lord lord mcintosh <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> at that stage i was not taking part in the debate <e>", "<cs> that is extremely disappointing for two reasons <e> <s> first my noble friend says that she thinks this whole thing is very reasonable and that there is no very good reason why it should not be there and secondly and much more importantly she reminded us that this provision came out of the act <e> <s> so local authorities have been having to deal with this situation for the last years or so <e>", "<cs> i should like to reduce this debate to a much simpler scale and to talk about the simple individual case of a friend of mine who is a tenant farmer on the isle of wight <e> <s> i understand that in england and wales i do not know about scotland about half the dairy farmers are tenant farmers <e> <s> there is no doubt that both the bill as it stands at present and the amendment of my noble friend lord middleton will be extremely harmful to my friend <e> <s> to use the words of the milk marketing board <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the amendment of my noble friend lord middleton does not put that right <e> <s> therefore without going into the detail which noble lords far more expert than i may do i shall leave the committee with three particular thoughts <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the quota is at its present level because of the enormous amount of money and effort which my friend as the tenant has put into the farm over some years in order to increase the dairy output of that particular acreage by four and a half times before what he calls quota day <e> <s> that is a tremendous contribution for which in the long term he should receive some kind of recompense <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> is down in my name <e> <s> if my noble friend is agreeable perhaps i may speak to it now <e> <s> bowing to the wish of my noble friend on the front bench i have agreed to speak to <e>", "<cs> i cannot welcome this as much as perhaps i should because there has been so little time to consider it <e> <s> it has not been possible for me to consult with the people with whom i normally consult on these matters and i have to speak more or less straight off the cuff <e> <s> i cannot be sure that i shall not have to try to put down some amendments at report stage <e> <s> however i shall do my best being really rather distressed that we have not had time to consider these matters <e> <s> it is all very well for some people to get together with the minister to produce what is virtually a rewriting of the bill but i think it would have been helpful if we could have had greater knowledge of what was happening <e>", "<cs> two days <e>", "<cs> i did not ask for amendment no <e> <s> to be described <e> <s> i asked for amendments nos <e> <s> and to be considered <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may explain <e> <s> i am sure the lord chairman would agree with me that when he calls amendment no <e> <s> which assuming the committee accepts this one will go through on the nod he will have to say that if he calls no <e> <s> he will not be able to call nos <e> <s> or so therefore it could not be spoken to <e>", "<cs> good enough <e>", "<cs> i said that this is a probing amendment so i do not propose to argue the point with the noble lord lord ennals at this stage <e> <s> i said also that i was aware that the amendment was defective and did not apply to all types of disabled people <e> <s> it certainly does not apply to the noble baroness lady masham because nearest relative is only a technical term which if one refers to amendment no <e> <s> comes from the mental health act <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend the minister for her sympathetic acceptance of the thinking behind the amendment <e> <s> i note with great care what the noble baroness lady masham said <e> <s> the difficulty is that there may be circumstances in which the nearest relative is causing the trouble <e> <s> and the provision would not be appropriate <e> <s> however there are many cases where it would be most unfortunate if the nearest relative were pushed too far out of the picture when he or she can still help <e> <s> i am not talking about physically disabled people i am talking solely about mentally ill people because i am only advised about them <e>", "<cs> if i may have the advice of the chairman of committees the noble baroness said that she was speaking among other things to <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> refers to a subsection which is being left out <e>", "<cs> good <e> <s> we will wait for it <e>", "<cs> that is not subject to a later order <e> <s> it is going to be the law <e> <s> it is on the face of the bill <e> <s> am i to understand that we are to rely upon guidance from the department to hospitals to make the point <e> <s> is that good enough <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend will comment <e>", "<cs> that is very much more acceptable <e> <s> i thank my noble friend and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the lord chairman <e> <s> perhaps we can look at amendment no <e> <s> in relation to the new subsection in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> there may be circumstances in which the person may request that the arrangements referred to should not be made but they might be subject to an assessment under section of the act which relates to aftercare in relation to people who are detained under section and certain persons who are criminals <e> <s> i would have thought that it was sensible to include such a provision in the bill in its new place at the end of subsection <e>", "<cs> it depends on the circumstances <e> <s> i accept the statements of my noble friend the minister but i am not quite so happy about the remarks of the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> however it is late and i shall not pursue the point <e> <s> we might return to it on report <e>", "<cs> would it be possible for my noble friends statisticians to be put in touch with the people who know about statistics and who might be able to help them <e>", "<cs> that is not a very happy reply <e> <s> however i shall write to my noble friend on the <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a real privilege to follow the splendid speech made by the noble lord lord crawshaw <e> <s> indeed i think it is the best speech we

that it is something which might happen but is he saying that it is something which will happen all the time <e> <s> is he saying that therefore we must have a public inquiry with all the expense and trouble that that involves <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord has been involved in public inquiries as indeed i have <e> <s> he knows that a public inquiry is a much bigger affair than this quite simple opportunity for tenants to have a say which it seems to me as my noble friend has said is a very sensible procedure <e> <s> i would suggest that the noble lords opposite have made a great meal minutes of a meal out of this question on a matter which is trying to give the tenants some sort of opportunity to say what they think <e> <s> there may be special cases when they are misled but it is really not worth the fuss <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has just proposed a further delay in a process <e>", "<cs> i just want to take up the point that the noble and learned lord lord silk in has made <e> <s> of course when one is discussing any bill one must have the right to put down amendments which one thinks are right <e> <s> there is one factor that needs to be considered against the

should hope that would not be so but it might and perhaps the wording could be improved if it were restricted only to local authorities <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene before my noble friend answers <e> <s> i am advised on this part of the bill by the cbi <e> <s> this particular type of issue is one as regards which the whole of this part of the bill is potentially very restrictive of

cbi my noble friend for the care that he and his department have given to take the cbis advice into consideration on all these amendments to this clause <e> <s> this has indeed been most helpful <e>",

me whether consultations have taken place with the cbi in the production of this code of practice for fieldworkers <e> <s> does he agree that the fieldworkers are unlikely to understand the commercial factors which may lie behind factory rebuilding alteration or demolition and which may be rather different from those of stately homes <e>", "<cs> as a matter of clarification and i may have missed this when the noble lord introduced the amendment may i ask the noble lord lord ennals the significance of subsection <e> <s> does that mean that the employees of the national health service will not

grouping if it is the responsibility of the usual channels i hope that they will read <e>", "<cs> i am sorry not to have had a more positive answer from my noble friend <e> <s> i should have liked her

effect on the farming land of this country <e> <s> is he aware that a side effect is that singapore is now demanding very low or zero levels of radiation in processed foods exported there <e> <s> is he further aware that a consignment of milk chocolate was recently turned back from singapore by way of example <e> <s> is it not wrong that there should be exemption from product liability for primary producers but not for secondary and tertiary producers who have to handle the same basic raw products <e>", "<cs> my lords may i further ask my noble friend whether he will take to heart what has been done in singapore <e> <s> perhaps he was not aware of that situation <e> <s> is that not very important with regard to exports <e> <s> i am sure he will agree that this country is utterly dependent on exporting <e> <s> if our important export products are stamped on because of the situation which has been created is this not very bad for the prosperity of this country <e> <s> should

advice from trinity house for which i am most grateful <e> <s> this whole subject has a long and tangled history and it has been clear for some time that the present pilotage arrangements are outmoded

logical conclusion when the pilots came to him and said we want to have million a year like certain top businessmen do he would give it to them <e> <s> there must be a limit to this and a system that

dedicated to their jobs and totally unselfish and ungreedy <e> <s> these things i am afraid do not happen <e>", "<cs> my lords surely we are talking about the bill and not what is happening now <e> <s> what is happening now is to be swept away by the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the so-called junk food in this country is wholesome because of very good food acts which have made sure that that is the case <e> <s> is she also aware that the experiment referred to is highly doubtful because there was no comparison test <e> <s> furthermore is she aware that the suggestion that various forms of additives cause aggression in children is also highly questionable and that these points really need to be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> i must start by declaring an interest as the adviser to a trade association which deals with the business of manufacturers of biscuits cakes confectionary and chocolate <e> <s> to take my noble friends immediate point if of course there are no examples of the present regulations having allowed harm to ordinary people to slip through as it were there really is not much worry on the part of farmers in having this in the bill <e> <s> why should they worry if they are well protected at the moment <e>", "<cs> i must interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> i did not say in insuring <e> <s> i said in sharing <e>", "<cs> may i pick up that point <e> <s> as a result of the chernobyl affair the singapore government refused to accept any biscuits from europe <e> <s> that has done great harm to our trade in that product in that part of the world <e> <s> the whole weight has been borne by the manufacturer <e>", "<cs> i should like to add only briefly to what my noble friends lord peyton and lord bruce-gardyne have said because they have covered most of the ground <e> <s> to re-emphasise one point innovation provides innumerable benefits to society and the consumer benefits from that <e> <s> these benefits are produced by large and small companies <e> <s> if the amendment is accepted the small companies in particular will be frightened away from trying the advanced research upon which this countrys benefits

anything for development and improvement <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i am not altogether happy with my noble friends answer <e> <s> i take his point that on amendment no <e> <s> if any person would do to produce a standard of safety then any person wanting to be an approved person could approve himself <e> <s> i think that is true <e> <s> there was an alternative of saying any recognised person but i think we need a qualification rather than making it so wide open <e> <s> if an international standard of safety is concerned that will have been approved by somebody <e>", "<cs> i was rather hoping that my noble friend would say that he would come back at a later stage <e> <s> however at this time of night one cannot expect everything <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs>

<e> <s> one gathers from listening to the argument that this is a very difficult problem <e>", "<cs> in many cases i would sympathise with my noble friend lord campbell of alloway but in this case i think what my noble friend on the front bench said was perfectly straightforward <e> <s> i found it very easy to understand and i do not see why he should go any further <e>", "<cs> surely we are talking here about the secretary of state approving a code issued possibly by somebody else <e> <s> the noble lord lord gallacher earlier on in this general debate was talking about this tripartite-issued concordat as it was described at one stage <e> <s> suppose that was accepted by the government and was prepared and perhaps issued by the three parties concerned <e> <s> the secretary of state might then approve it <e> <s> is that not the circumstance in which the bill as we now have it would be relevant <e> <s> is it necessary to have this change since the secretary of state does the final approving as the bill is now written <e> <s> it is only the issuing of such a document which is under question <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may supplement what my noble friend has said <e> <s> in my experience on the two or three occasions when i have prayed against a negative order i have got a better debate going at a better time of day than when we have debated an affirmative order <e> <s> we have had long arguments about this and i know it affects the status but as for the practicality of stopping the government doing something that looks nasty the negative procedure is just as good and i think in some ways better <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not most important not to mention detailed figures when one is talking about a deterrent <e> <s> it is much more important to keep people guessing about ones capability than to try to spell it out <e> <s> would it not be better if noble lords opposite did not try to intrigue my noble friend into giving details <e> <s> would it not be better if this question to which my noble friend has not given a figure answer is forgotten altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that all these amendments particularly nos <e> <s> and are limiting the competent harbour authoritys choice of pilot and removing its control over the number of pilots it has to employ <e> <s> to that extent it is defeating the object of the bill to make sure that the numbers that are employed satisfy the demands of a particular port <e> <s> i did not get from either my noble friend lord swinfen or the noble lord lord underhill the message that that was what they had in mind but that would seem to me to be the outcome of these amendments if they were to be agreed to <e> <s> accordingly i am against them if it comes to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to sound again a damp note on this but it seems to me that this is an attempt to guarantee a pilots level of earnings under the new arrangements <e> <s> the amendment disregards other aspects of conditions such as volume of work hours or work nature of work area of work and so on <e> <s> it also ignores the fact that sometimes earning levels have been brought up much too highly by ill thought-out rate setting by existing pilotage authorities <e> <s> therefore i doubt whether the amendment should be supported <e> <s> we debated it in committee and i think it should be rejected <e>", "<cs> my lords if amendment no <e> <s> is withdrawn then the point of amendment no <e> <s> is lost because it is not leaving out paragraph a it is just leaving out a <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is consequential on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather think that the noble lord lord shackleton for whom i have the highest opinion having started off in your lordships house under his leadership is over-exaggerating this situation <e> <s> my noble friend has been sniping from behind <e> <s> it is all fair for the opposition <e> <s> i can remember being in opposition and producing just the sort of arguments that the opposition are now producing we must have the guidelines and it is no good going to this stage of the bill without the guidelines <e> <s> it is a common thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that <e>", "<cs> i shall reply when i come to wind up <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a happy little debate <e> <s> perhaps i may answer quickly because we must not waste time <e> <s> we have wasted too much time already on unnecessary divisions <e>", "<cs> to take the point of the noble viscount lord simon my noble friend the minister said in committee that we want the expert knowledge and experience of pilots in the areas in which they can be useful and i said that that was absolutely right <e> <s> the object of the amendment is to make sure that they are not involved in discussions on their pay and other conditions <e> <s> in that respect the shipping interests as such would not be affected <e> <s> the representatives of the shipping industry would not be talking about that sort of thing <e> <s> that answers the noble lord lord underhill <e>", "<cs> yes it will <e> <s> however in another place they vote on their own pay from time to time <e> <s> the buck must stop somewhere and perhaps parliament is the place <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking strictly at this stage to amendment no <e> <s> only and with great trepidation crossing swords with the noble and learned lord i am advised that the use of the word reasonable could expose a competent harbour authority to challenge in the courts on the grounds that the arrangements made were not reasonable <e> <s> it is also unquestionably the case that amendment no <e> <s> would greatly weaken the ability of the competent harbour authority to determine the nature of the services to be provided <e> <s> but the problem of being challenged in the courts is a rather more important one <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make two quick points <e> <s> one is that we often have this pressure for recommitment when somebody has produced a new clause as a result of pressure at an earlier stage and i do not think it is deserved in this case <e> <s> my other point is on what the noble lord lord strathcona has just said <e> <s> i have down amendment no <e> <s> which is about disputes procedure and i am not sure that i would not welcome his thought when i come to that <e> <s> for once i have agreed with him but i do not expect that i shall do so again <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the amendments would extend the power of the cha to impose compulsory pilotage <e> <s> they would give a cha power to do so by a pilotage direction both within and outside its area of jurisdiction <e> <s> there would be no right of appeal <e> <s> that is unacceptable <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will be able to turn down the proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very strongly to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful to my noble friend for undertaking to bring something forward on these lines at the next stage and i have pleasure in withdrawing this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is late and i shall not pursue this point <e> <s> i see a germ of a way through for this <e> <s> i can see in the long term what my noble friend is saying <e> <s> there may be a stage when the new chas do <e>", "<cs> my lords these four amendments all water down the provisions of this clause <e> <s> as drafted the competent harbour authorities shall grant a pilotage certificate to masters and first mates who can satisfy the competent harbour authority of their <e>", "<cs> of the competent masters of ships <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e> <s> i am

my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his full reply <e> <s> could he give the house some idea of the cost to the government of these schemes and whether they are cost effective as compared with voluntary schemes which might do the same sort of job just as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to offer congratulations to my ex-colleagues of sub-committee d which sat under the able leadership of the noble lord lord gallacher <e> <s> your lordships will find my name in appendix of this report but i must confess that i did not take any part in the production of it <e> <s> however i am therefore in a good position to say how splendid it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord tedder will forgive me if i do not immediately follow him in his contribution which was too specialised for me <e> <s> this debate has already been conducted for the past four days in <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have to declare an interest but it is not quite such a detailed interest as those of several other speakers who are deeply involved in the businesses they were seeking to defend <e> <s> i have a son who is an insurance broker but i hasten to tell your lordships that i have never done business with him because i have been brought up never to do business with members of ones

declaration will have to be made of exactly what it is <e> <s> that part of the rules will have to be accepted <e> <s> in that respect it will be made clear to the customer that there is a special bias <e> <s> polarisation is the only policeable way of removing bias <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that when i moved south in the situation described by the noble lord lord dean was exactly the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend lord strathcona goes too far <e> <s> he talked at one stage about total protection for the pilots because of their special situation <e> <s> none of us has total protection <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend will find that he did because i noted them with care earlier in his speech <e> <s> it is that which strikes me as being unreasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for carrying out the undertaking that he gave earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand the amendment <e> <s> in the navy we talk about major war vessels which includes ships battleships aircraft carriers submarines and destroyers and minor war vessels <e> <s> vessels is a better comprehensive term for all types of seagoing craft than

help the shipping interests where that was relevant <e> <s> the bill is very much better now than it was before <e> <s> i am sorry that at times i may have appeared to be over-critical of the pilots in the interests of the economy of shipping on which i think the country ultimately depends <e> <s> i hope that the bill has a happy passage through all its stages in another place and that it will not be too changed when it returns to us <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be allowed to comment from this side on what the noble and learned lord lord denning has just said <e> <s> it seemed to me that all he was doing was making more the point that we sought to make in committee and on which we were defeated that trying to draw a distinction between primary agricultural products and processed products

that there might be no legal difference between the two ways of putting this but that there could well be a psychological difference <e> <s> she went on to say that it was important in the interests of the consumer that the wording of the directive should be adhered to or words to that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to endorse the splendid speech of the noble lord lord porritt and to make just two or three points <e> <s> the first is that the noble lord lord allen rather dismissively referred to that highly profitable industry as though that was somehow a wrong thing to be

grateful to my noble friend for spelling out the position in more detail <e> <s> my only regret is that being convinced by my noble friend means that i have to agree with the noble lord lord williams

to this same area but was broader <e> <s> my amendment referred to any approved person <e> <s> he has narrowed it to british or european approvals <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment in principle i could hardly not do so in view of the extensive quotations from my own contribution at committee stage <e> <s> it follows on from what i was saying before that i am not quite happy about this amendment <e> <s> it brings the secretary of state into this area which is perhaps going too high <e> <s> for example i suppose it can be said that the bsi is approved as a body but

explaining the bill so clearly to us and for the bill so far as it goes <e> <s> i had hoped to say a few words about the contribution of the noble viscount lord st davids but having slipped into the chamber he has slipped out again <e> <s> perhaps if he returns i might have a few minutes to do so at the end of my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i endorse what the noble lord lord houghton has just said in particular his reference to customs and excise who can flaunt your lordships by slipping administrative legislation through by way of finance bills it has done so for several years now which your lordships cannot change <e> <s> that is most disgraceful <e> <s> i trust that the government will have a look at the matter to see whether that sly way of getting legislation through parliament should not be brought to a a close <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank my noble friend the secretary of state for the introduction of this vast bill <e> <s> i also welcome the bill for bringing up to date the law on these subjects after quite a long time <e> <s> there are many who say that perhaps the bill is overdue <e> <s> i like to think that there is much in it which is

anxious to be in a position to be representative persons <e> <s> the amendment would introduce an unnecessary degree of inflexibility <e>", "<cs> it is most unfortunate that the noble lord should seek

<s> therefore presumably he is not happy with what is happening now <e> <s> so far as i can understand from the advice that i have had it may be that the general council of british shipping has not been able to convince my noble friends advisers that three months would not be good enough but i am not sure that his advisers have convinced my advisers that the present arrangement of six months is unsatisfactory and that there is all sorts of evidence that this is so <e> <s> my noble friend did not say that there was any such evidence and nor did noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has his own view <e> <s> first may i point out that it is up to six months <e> <s> secondly i do not think there is any evidence of british shipowners buying ships abroad which are in a terrible state of repair and which are liable to fall apart before they have been surveyed <e> <s> apart from anything else that would be commercially stupid <e> <s> there is much more to this and i am not at all satisfied that my noble friend thinks he has struck the happy medium <e> <s> there is probably room for something nearer the six months that is the present state of affairs <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i am advised by the general council of british shipping as the committee and my noble friend know <e> <s> it welcomes the principle for this clause but is concerned that the regulations might be drawn up too tightly <e> <s> of course they must not be too loose <e> <s> the council hoped that it would be consulted in the drawing up of the regulations <e> <s> can my noble friend give me an assurance that the general council will be consulted on the drawing up of regulations <e>", "<cs> there is one point which i think the noble lord lord parry overlooks and which my noble friend lord campbell of croy mentioned <e> <s> that is the very hard-fought common fisheries policy which we had to study at great length in the happy days when i was a member of european communities sub-committee d there was no doubt about it that that was worked out extremely carefully <e>", "<cs> there is a small point i wish to raise purely for clarification <e> <s> as i remember it from my training board days the merchant navy training board was a voluntary one <e> <s> it was not established by statute <e> <s> i imagine that with the passage of time if it so suited the shipping industry who support it and who created it to wind it up and this amendment went through then we would be lost as to who should be given the financial assistance <e>", "<cs> in practice most of those receiving financial assistance are likely to be british citizens and will be serving on ships manned by masters and officers holding a uk certificate of competence <e> <s> however nationals of the republic of ireland and some commonwealth countries are also entitled to obtain uk certificates of competence or have their national certificates of competence recognised by the uk <e> <s> this clause would prevent assistance being given to a cadet resident in the uk who happened to be an irish national or to trainees serving on ships any one of whose officers happened to hold an irish or commonwealth certificate of competence <e> <s> i suggest that this clause therefore becomes unnecessarily inflexible <e>", "<cs> in practice the only shipowners who would benefit from the provision are those who are tax-resident in the united kingdom <e> <s> some of their crew may not be tax-resident in the united kingdom <e> <s> however the crew agreement may still require them to be repatriated to the united kingdom before they make their own way to their homes in say ireland or the channel islands <e>", "<cs> i see the point behind the two amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and in the name of the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> i have some sympathy for them <e> <s> however i believe that it is extremely important that in this process we do not so emasculate the position of the master that his authority is undermined because he does not have the responsibility that he should have <e> <s> for that reason i do not support these amendments <e>", "<cs> i am indeed grateful to my noble friend the minister for explaining the fairly complicated position so fully <e> <s> i am not wholly persuaded by his arguments although rather more persuaded by the arguments on amendments nos <e> <s> and and amendment no <e> <s> than by his arguments in relation to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however i shall have to read very carefully what he had to say <e>

covers it by the words <e>", "<cs> in conclusion i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friends speech was more convincing than his letter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my amendment no <e> <s> was tabled to ensure that the subsection did not make the salvage of property compulsory as it appeared <e> <s> my <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend that this would set a very difficult precedent <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord underhill will withdraw this amendment <e> <s> the safeguards mentioned by my noble friend through the industrial tribunals are fully established <e> <s> it would be very difficult in personnel terms <e>", "<cs> as regards amendment no <e> <s> to which the noble lord was also speaking i do not understand how an independent accident investigator can be representative of anybody because if he is representative of someone he is not independent <e> <s> the wording of the amendment would have to be changed in any case <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> this rather remarkable amendment would introduce a purely nationalistic condition into a perfectly normal transaction <e> <s> surely the right criteria by which such operations should be judged is whether they are safe and pollution free <e> <s> the amendment would introduce a degree of inflexibility which would obviously have cost consequences for the operator <e> <s> i suggest that the committee should reject this amendment very firmly <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend for accepting the principle of amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i look forward to the amendments which my noble friend will put down at the next stage to deal with those points <e> <s> i shall read carefully what my noble friend has said about amendments nos <e> <s> and with a view possibly to coming back at a later stage <e> <s> that will also depend on what my noble friend lord gray of contin wishes to do <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his careful explanation of the situation <e> <s> i am left with a niggling thought because i am not entirely happy with the arrangements concerning the light fund <e> <s> it may be that this is not the right bill upon which to return to the charge on the matter <e> <s> it leaves a tiny question mark and i may come back to this area at report stage <e> <s> for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we must move with the times <e> <s> the provision contained in subsection is welcome because it puts shipowners in the same position as other employers following the repeal of the truck acts <e> <s> almost all seafarers are now paid monthly <e> <s> shipowners like the facility to forward the balance of wages due to a former employee on the next pay day after he leaves their employment <e> <s> the proposed amendments would remove that facility gracing it with a degree of protection which is not enjoyed by other categories of employee <e> <s> therefore i hope that the committee will resist this amendment <e>", "<cs> the power of a superintendent or proper officer to decide disputes about seamens wages is long obsolete and provides a degree of protection not enjoyed by any other category of employee <e> <s> i strongly hope that the committee will resist this amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for what he said and the care with which he said it <e> <s> i appreciate what he said in the earlier part of his speech <e> <s> we shall of course read what he said in <e>", "<cs> yes indeed and we shall return to this subject in much greater detail at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> it is in this part that we sought to cover the points i made <e> <s> we saw that in certain circumstances it would be difficult to determine whether or not certain kinds of articles were works of art <e> <s> the bill seeks to cover that point in clauses and where it defines a whole range of what i would call near the knuckle articles which some people might not consider to be artistic <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for undertaking to look at the more important amendments that we have been considering <e> <s> although he was a little cautious about whether he would do anything i hope it will turn out in that way <e> <s> he made a number of remarks with which i did not entirely agree although i do not really want to go over that ground <e> <s> it is a matter of interpretation <e> <s> we shall all read the discussion very carefully <e> <s> however i firmly believe that somewhere in this debate there is some vestige of a lack of understanding <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> on that double assurance i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should clarify that particular point <e> <s> when a two-dimensional work which is an artistic work is turned into a three-dimensional work by some technical process there is a risk that it may be interpreted as ceasing to be an artistic work because it has had a mechanical process applied to it <e> <s> that is the kind of thing at which the amendment is aimed <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i think that he has put his finger on the problem and by carrying us around different parts of the bill has probably resolved the matter for us <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend but i must make my contribution although he tried to prevent us from doing so <e> <s> i applaud him for trying <e> <s> it is important that my point about computer programs to which my amendments relate is made <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is a paving amendment for amendment no <e> <s> which is the key amendment <e> <s> i was grateful to the noble lord lord williams for his support for the principle of that amendment <e>", "<cs> i have to add at once that if my noble friend lord ferrers brings amendment no <e> <s> into the argument i am totally opposed to that <e> <s> it defeats the argument completely <e> <s> i trust that my <e>", "<cs> i can support what the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has said in respect of his amendment <e> <s> it is a matter of opinion as to which of our amendments contain the most suitable wording because they are similar <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the noble lord and remind him that an earlier grouping included amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> at my request it was altered to the grouping around amendment no <e> <s> because that was my amendment <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> should be dealt with on its own so it was taken out <e> <s> the latest grouping does not contain those amendments <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a brief comment <e> <s> i think that my noble friend has provided quite a good answer but i shall be interested to read it later in detail <e> <s> mention of the passive recipient worries me slightly because the person may be truly passive for example perhaps he invites people into his sitting room and receives a beautiful copy of the mona lisa on his television screen <e> <s> he is thus totally passive he does nothing <e> <s> he simply receives the picture and others also see it <e> <s> everyone gets an opportunity to view it and so no one goes to spend money in paris <e>", "<cs> the explanation sounds fairly plausible but i shall have to read it very carefully to be quite certain that it is all we want <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> this is one of the least happy replies my noble friend has given us <e> <s> he said that there were safeguards such as we were seeking in subsection b <e> <s> those would be splendid safeguards were it not for the fact that subsection states <e>", "<cs> my noble friend did not take up my point <e> <s> what is needed is for him to undertake to have another look at subsection and see whether that could be reworded <e> <s> it may be that sweeping it away would not make any difference <e> <s> if that is so why have it in the bill <e> <s> however that is another subject altogether <e> <s> there are a lot of people who want greater reassurance on this point and it would be most reassuring if he could say that he was going to take this away and have a look at it <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for having gone as far as he can and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down will he not give thought to the many <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that my noble friend went rather fast <e> <s> he seems to have explained himself very well to my noble and learned friend lord hailsham but right at the end he said that he hoped his undertakings would satisfy noble lords and that they will feel free to withdraw their amendments <e> <s> however i did not hear the undertakings <e> <s> can my noble friend spell them out rather more slowly <e>", "<cs> what is the purpose <e> <s> i did not know what purpose my noble friend was referring to <e>", "<cs> i am still a bit vague <e> <s> i am terribly sorry but it is frightfully important to get this right <e> <s> i must ask my noble friend to say it again because i just did not hear him <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend has gone as far as i would wish him to go at this stage <e> <s> i hope very much that when he considers this matter and all that has been said he will make sure that whatever arrangement comes forward does not bear unfairly on small firms <e> <s> i think it will be all right but that is the main aspect that i hope he will include <e> <s> at this stage therefore and watching carefully what the amendments will be for the next stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it may help if i say that it seems to me quite clear that the person so described by the noble lord is another person directly connected with the activities of the establishment <e>", "<cs> surely the noble lord lord graham has been making a clause stand part speech <e> <s> he has not addressed himself to the amendment at all <e> <s> he asked a question about educational establishments <e> <s> that is dealt with in clause <e> <s> one ought at least to read the bill <e> <s> it is not quite within the normal practices of the committee to make a speech on an amendment which does not have any relation to the amendment <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> the amendment relates to clause <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord cullen has asked me to speak for him on these points <e> <s> i speak only to add to what the noble lord lord williams has said and to the same purpose <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a is doing the job in clause in a slightly different way <e> <s> i am open to choice <e> <s> however i think one or the other ought to be there <e>", "<cs> in clause the situation is different from that in the other cases <e> <s> the amendment is therefore more appropriate <e>", "<cs> i wish to correct a point and to apologise to the noble lord lord kilbracken <e> <s> i now realise that there is an error in the wording of amendment no <e> <s> a as it appears on the marshalled list <e> <s> it should read certifies not satisfies <e> <s> i draw the point to the attention also of my noble friend the minister <e>", "<cs> i think that is probably a very satisfactory explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that explanation and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down he did not cover the point raised by my noble friend lord caldecote that industry has a great range of tapes for recording which have nothing to do with copyright <e> <s> does he say that it pays a levy which then goes to the recording companies <e>", "<cs> i wish to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> it seems absolutely sensible and rather simple <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend the minister can accept it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for undertaking to look at this point and clarify the clause <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the deletion of clause would deprive copyright owners of an important right of seizure of infringing articles <e> <s> loss of that right can only make it easier for copyright pirates and counterfeiters <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord would not want to encourage them <e>", "<cs> i am advised that the effect of the amendment would be completely to neuter the impact of clause <e> <s> establishing that copyright subsists and that the plaintiff is the owner of the copyright are costly operations <e> <s> i am no lawyer so i do not know how much the costs benefit the lawyers <e> <s> the requirement to provide this type of proof especially when it is not necessary dramatically increases the legal costs of the copyright infringement actions <e> <s> i hope that the committee will reject the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to cross swords again with the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran as we often join in these affairs together <e> <s> however i am advised that removing imprisonment as a penalty would not be reasonable <e> <s> where copyright <e>", "<cs> i understand what my noble friend has said and i thank him for explaining the matter at such length <e> <s> i should like to think about it and at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> sadly my noble friend is very convincing <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to suggest to your lordships that the addition of this subsection would introduce an element of wide political discretion as to which ships the secretary of state should allow on the united kingdom register <e> <s> i suggest that that is undesirable and that subsection as it stands goes far enough in giving the secretary of state a measure of control of the ships that are on the register <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will not support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it will not surprise your lordships to hear that one month will not be any more suitable now than it was at committee stage <e> <s> indeed i sought to press for six months which has been the practice heretofore <e> <s> however my noble friend the minister produced a good argument at committee stage and he has since written me a letter which spells this out in greater detail and i have come to agree that in modern times three months would be a suitable interval <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to say that i do not think that the amendment goes quite far enough although i appreciate what the noble lord has done to try to accommodate the points that i made last time <e> <s> for the benefit of the house perhaps i may be allowed to repeat briefly what the problem is <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that would get over the question of the trainee who might well be an irishman <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to support the amendment not having had the opportunity previously to support the noble lords lord carmichael and lord underhill <e> <s> it seems to me that the amendment will be a useful clarification of the purpose of the clause while still allowing action to be taken against the master or owner of a ship which was found to be dangerously unseaworthy while in port <e> <s> the amendment therefore seems wholly desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords there were amendments not dissimilar to these moved in committee <e> <s> the one matter that worries me about them is that i believe they diminish the authority of the master <e> <s> it is very important that one should be in no doubt and i am sure that the masters are not in any doubt that masters always have a duty not to let their ships be in an unsafe condition <e> <s> it seems to me that in trying to water this down in the way which has been done with these three amendments one is in effect diminishing the authority of the master and his sense of responsibility for his task that is to take a ship to sea in a seaworthy condition <e> <s> the degree to which he is personally able to check each and every point is not of tremendous importance because if a case arises the particular qualifications of masters are well known and would be taken into account by a court in relation to these particular items which are currently listed in subsection in greater detail than they are in the new subsection <e> <s> on the whole it is better that this clause should not be mucked about with <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord strathcona and mount royal because his solution had occurred to me too that is that clause d should read to the effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful to my noble friend for all that he has said both in relation to amendment no <e> <s> and to demise charterers in connection with clause <e> <s> i have no doubt that if it is that difficult we may not be sure of seeing an amendment at third reading though i very much hope that we do <e> <s> if not i hope that the other place will deal with it properly <e> <s> at this stage i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting to hear the purpose behind the amendment parts of which seem reasonable but parts of which are either unnecessary or go a little too far <e> <s> as a whole the subsection has the principal effect of placing in positive terms the duties of the owner for which he is penalised if he fails to discharge them <e> <s> as he is governed by clauses and i think that the amendment is redundant <e> <s> however parts of it may be suitable <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to thank my noble friend for coming forward with these amendments which he undertook to make on behalf of my noble friend lord gray of contain and myself <e> <s> it is very nice to see them in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his very careful explanation which to my mind gives real strength to the amendment and is a good reason for it <e>", "<cs> i find this a difficult matter <e> <s> i in no sense wish to deprive her majesty of anything she requires but the servants of the crown are pushing themselves into a position of great superiority which is not accorded to others <e> <s> i am not sure that that is strictly fair <e> <s> why should they not be subject to clause ii just like anyone else <e> <s> if it is something commissioned at public expense what about a company that commissions something at its expense or anything that the minister or i might commission <e> <s> why is the crown different in this area <e> <s> if there was a security aspect to it i could understand it <e> <s> if there is a financial aspect i do not see why the servants of the crown should be in a superior position <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord say how his view applies to the case quoted by the noble lord lord willis <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord willis for his splendid example <e> <s> it seems to me that the more government-owned affairs that can be privatised the better <e> <s> that will make for more fairness all round <e> <s> i am upset by what the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran had to say about the queen <e> <s> i specifically excluded her from my strictures <e>", "<cs> having listened to all of this i still think it is unfair <e> <s> however at this stage it is much too late to pursue the argument and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords

situation so fully <e> <s> i very much take the point he makes about the <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see that it is not possible to press my noble friend further at this stage <e> <s> i also understand that he cannot give me any undertakings <e> <s> however i hope that he will give this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that this time i cannot go along with the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> this

victuals because i thought they knew what i wanted and would be bound to do it <e> <s> they did not provide the victuals <e> <s> we went off on a fairly extensive trip and we were away from a proper

my noble friend for his amendment <e> <s> it seems to meet the situation as we tried to put it forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for spotting those consequential amendments and i apologise for not having moved them myself at an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend the minister for the courteous way in which he received all our pleas and the care he took to consider them <e> <s> hope that when the bill finishes its passage through another place it will have that extra hit of perfection which i believe is still outstanding and needed

also thank my noble friend for undertaking to have a look at the precise definition of what sort of marketing should trigger off the periods in the clause as it stands <e>", "<cs> clause has the effect of preventing an action for design right infringement where it would be possible to take an action for infringement of copyright <e> <s> since the design right is a lesser right this provision is unnecessary <e> <s> furthermore it may have the effect of denying protection to features of design which are of value <e> <s> i should be grateful if my noble friend could comment on that because it seems to me that there is no need for clause and it would seem to be wrong to put it into the bill if that is the case <e>", "<cs> the effect of clause is to deny design right protection to material which is included in the specification of a patent application <e> <s> it operates from the date of publication of that material thereby denying a proprietor of a patent application protection in the period between the publication and the grant of a patent <e> <s> during this period he is therefore not in a position to seek legal redress for infringement of design right since he cannot enforce the patent during this period <e> <s> furthermore if the patent application is rejected or subsequently lapsed he would have lost the ability to enforce the design right <e> <s> the

copyright <e> <s> however it is recognised that there may be a need for crown use in an emergency and it is therefore suggested that clause should be retained <e> <s> that clause will however have to be amended to enable it to stand alone <e>", "<cs> i deliberately did not refer to defence in introducing my objection to clauses and for two reasons <e> <s> first the provision enables the current practice of the ministry of defence of commandeering designs and much later deciding on the non-market price to pay for them to be extended to an area to which this practice does not at the moment extend <e> <s> therefore it has the kind of powers about which my noble friend was talking in a wide range of such matters <e> <s> it is questionable whether it needs to be extended in this area in any event <e> <s> i am not altogether sure that the ministry wants that but one cannot talk about that publicly <e> <s> i believe that the argument about defence therefore should be forgotten <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for my noble friends undertaking and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not agree at all with the noble lord <e> <s> the problem with the bill is that it is terribly comprehensive and there are far too many people interested in it <e> <s> it is not just a question of people but different factions <e> <s> it is bound to be like this and i think my noble

helpful but i shall read his reply with care <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for agreeing to study what has been said <e> <s> i hope that

all sorts of examples <e> <s> the bill takes us a step further in making sure that we can do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord donaldson for his support for the principle of my amendment <e> <s> he went to the root of the problem <e> <s> why not have a separate definition if it is different <e> <s> in view of the fact that i am advised and i repeat that holograms can be

minister for responding to the amendments which we put down in committee and to say that industry as a whole is indeed grateful for this <e> <s> i think that it is an excellent first step towards something that may follow <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene to say that i was talking strictly of the information technology part of the industry and not what the cbi is in charge of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords who took part in this debate and note with interest that from all sides the opposition our own side and the cross-benches everyone is against this

extremely powerful and we shall deal with its rights in other parts of the bill <e> <s> however it does not seem necessary that it should have quite the powers it has and i hope that the minister will be able to find the refinement of wording for which he has undertaken to look by the next stage of the bill <e> <s> with that undertaking i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the amendments and i am impressed that they are so simple <e> <s> i am puzzled by the fact that what he has done is to alter the marginal descriptions of clause <e> <s> i am interested that marginal descriptions have a substance in law <e> <s> i should have thought that only the text has such substance but obviously that must be so because i am advised by my expert advisers that that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is doing that perhaps i may suggest that he give thought to saying in both cases identification of the <e> <s> i think that

subsection a of this clause <e> <s> i expect that there may be other places in the bill that need such treatment but i thought that i would rub it in a little <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am concerned this amendment is a follow-on from my amendment no <e> <s> discussed in committee on th december and i am returning to the charge on it <e> <s> at that time the minister said at col <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down has he taken the precaution of investigating what is done in the united states in this area <e> <s> if not would he care to do that before this subject

point any further <e> <s> i hope to look into <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for explaining the position at some length <e> <s> i am not altogether happy with what he has said <e> <s> it is unfortunate i think my noble friend admitted this if as my noble friend lord lucas said the whole point of the provision is to look after motor cars <e> <s> i cannot believe that that is what the government intended <e> <s> i know that the minister went on to say that it also covers everything else <e> <s> but what has frightened those of us on the industry side is that it seems to have started with motor cars and then perhaps been modified <e> <s> it would have been better if it had started with everything else and then taken into <e>", "<cs> my lords that makes it slightly better but it looks as though the government started with motor cars <e> <s> obviously one must read with great care what has been said <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for agreeing with me on the modifications to what is now subsection d in saying that it is covered elsewhere in the bill <e> <s> we will have to take a close look at that to see whether we agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for thanking me <e> <s> unfortunately although i pointed something out to him his amendments do not encompass the amendment that we wished to make to clause at an earlier stage <e> <s> to that extent therefore his contribution is not quite as splendid as i should have hoped <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for putting his point of view so fully <e> <s> it would have been nice had it been different <e> <s> it is interesting that in his closing remarks he said that inventors deserve greater protection than designers <e> <s> i am not sure that that would

that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran thinks that my amendments might be the best answer to the problem <e> <s> as i understand it his amendments are a fallback <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> the only other point in relation to the ministry of defence is that it could give no examples of the need for the clauses that i seek to delete <e> <s> it is possible that that

subsection is right quite apart from the wording of it but at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is exactly the same as amendment no <e> <s> in relation to clause <e> <s> as my noble friend lord stockton said this is all about the privilege of communication for patent agents <e> <s> it is a privilege which accrues to the advantage of the patent agents client and that client is usually industry <e> <s> in general industry wishes to have a professional adviser of its choice without artificial restrictions <e> <s> many industries use patent agents for advice on all intellectual property matters <e> <s> bearing in mind the criminalisation of copyright law it is important that privilege should attach to communication with patent agents for all legal proceedings including those of a criminal nature <e> <s> it is doubtful whether patent agents would be involved in advising on criminal proceedings but their advice might be germane to such proceedings and should enjoy the same privilege as communication with solicitors <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the case would it not be appropriate for the government to encourage the regional and district health authorities to slow down the closing of hospital beds for the mentally ill until the government are sure that aftercare facilities are available for the patients <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said earlier that section applied to detained patients <e> <s> does he not agree that it applies to people detained under section which concerns commission for treatment <e> <s> it is a general requirement and is not just for people who are locked up <e>", "<cs> in view of the first line of subsection of clause it seems to me that the proposed amendment directly contradicts that line <e> <s> i do not understand why the noble baroness lady turner does not remove the words <e>", "<cs> i should like to intervene because i was quoted by the noble lord lord mccarthy on a couple of occasions <e> <s> at second reading i suggested that this clause should remain part of the bill and that the objections to it were not as valid as they may have been in the past <e> <s> i shall not repeat what i said on that occasion <e> <s> the important point is that the cbi has been quoted as being on the side of those who are against the clause <e> <s> after i had spoken against it i received a letter from the cbi stating that my views on clause were shared by a substantial number albeit a minority of cbi members <e> <s> i should like to get that in proportion <e>", "<cs> i find this recent plea which is what it sounds like from the other side very strange <e> <s> it does not seem to bear any relationship to the amendment under discussion <e> <s> we are talking about amendment no <e> <s> but so far as i can gather the noble lord lord mccarthy was inviting my noble friend to tell him all that he is ever going to say in relation to all the other amendments now <e>", "<cs> the time to tell people evidence to back up something is in relation to particular amendments <e> <s> this is a very strange sort of thing <e> <s> i am quite sure that noble lords think they are doing the right thing and i do not wish to go on with this argument <e> <s> what i want to do is to encourage the committee to get on with the amendment and to take amendments in an orderly fashion <e> <s> let us get through them finish them and if we have nothing else to talk about let us not introduce strange subjects which relate to the bill as a whole <e>", "<cs> for heavens sake let us get on with the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may ask whether she is speaking only to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i thought that amendment no <e> <s> and my amendment no <e> <s> were grouped with it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may now speak to my amendment amendment no <e> <s> which is grouped with amendment no

which one deals should be properly organised and truly efficient <e>", "<cs> my lords what efforts are the government making to ensure that our case is given every possible encouragement so that the advice given by the commission is in our favour rather than in favour of the other three sites <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for explaining in such detail exactly why <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his full explanation which i shall read with great care <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> some years ago i knew a young man who was out of a job <e> <s> he was very ambitious but he could not get the right sort of job <e> <s> without going through a long story which would be a waste of time i must tell you that he had

from glasgow to london on a sunday at <e>", "<cs> my noble friend makes that point but if as a tourist from the other side of the atlantic you are travelling from glasgow to london you do not go

the odd person he would only overcrowd the bar and would soon drift away somewhere else <e> <s> the government are much too cautious in believing that because the public can get there therefore it must not be allowed to happen <e> <s> i think that is absolute nonsense <e>", "<cs> i strongly support this amendment <e> <s> we have vineyards on the isle of wight which suffer from the present law and which will benefit from the new clause <e> <s> however as he said and as we know it deals only with weekdays and not sundays <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend remember that unemployment in the isle of wight is comparable to that in all those areas which have been mentioned all of which receive some sort of support while the isle of wight receives none <e> <s> would he care to comment on that matter <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bonham-carter mentioned the case of the biochemist whose <e>", "<cs> when i first took a more active part in your lordships house some years ago when the noble and learned lord who has just so eloquently moved this amendment was sitting on the woolsack i remember being very emphatic and making powerful speeches about the wickedness of the negative procedure and the importance of the affirmative procedure <e> <s> that was in the early days when i did not fully realise that there was a virtual convention between this place and another place that if there is any difficulty about an affirmative procedure the government will first put the affirmative procedure motion before the other place and then we cannot resist it <e> <s> that was the case when members opposite were in government and it is the case now <e> <s> that takes a lot of the steam out of the value to this house i do not necessarily speak about another place of having the

amendments to put down to the schedule only last weekend and i propose to introduce them on report <e> <s> however i propose to give the minister forewarning of that at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords

matter <e> <s> i do not propose to take the question to a division because that would not be the sensible thing to do <e> <s> we might lose the amendment <e> <s> we have seen many amendments lost today and perhaps more than is reasonable <e> <s> so that would not be an answer <e> <s> in any case my noble friend is right <e> <s> he was kind enough to make the point that there is a very serious problem here which is not answered by discussions and reviews <e> <s> there is a need for the law to be altered <e> <s> however at this stage i shall certainly withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may leave this thought with my noble friend <e> <s> he says that the practice of expecting the final carrier to bear the cost of the commitment whatever it is has been accepted for many years <e> <s> no doubt there was a period when it did not matter very much <e> <s> there was not a great deal of air travel because it was too expensive or did not exist and people

friend would like to hear about <e>", "<cs> my lords as the only naval officer taking part in this debate i was uncertain about the noble lord lord mayhew until he told us about his role it is a privilege to join your lordships <e> <s> having relatively recently acquired the honour of being made a lord lieutenant that has drawn me into close contact with the territorial army <e> <s> therefore i feel that i can join with your lordships with a slightly outside view <e> <s> it has also given me the honour of wearing an army-type uniform and i confess that i greatly enjoy the difficulties of getting into it and of coping with the spurs when i am wearing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most disappointed in my noble friends remarks and in his inability to see a flexible way of introducing the kind of provision about which we have been talking <e> <s> i shall not take up too much of your lordships time but i should like to say a few words to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> he damned my amendment with faint praise and said that he did not believe it to be necessary <e> <s> in order not to waste the time of the house i deliberately did not repeat all that i said in committee and at report <e> <s> however i should like to recommend that my noble friend reads what was said on those occasions by myself and other noble lords <e> <s> he would then understand clearly

grateful to my noble friend for the extra care that was taken to include these amendments which he promised when the bill left us <e>", "<cs> my lords the general council of british shipping welcomes the new clauses <e> <s> but the council and i hope very much that they will not have to be implemented <e> <s> we see them especially as improving the bargaining position of the united kingdom

answer but it is very disappointing <e> <s> is it not a fact that in the second biennial report of the mental health act commission attention was drawn to the fact that this section had not been fulfilled as happily as one might have expected <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that the instruction within section is extremely clear <e> <s> i paraphrase that section <e> <s> it states that the managers of hospitals shall take such steps as are practicable to inform the person that is the nearest relative <e> <s> costs are not involved in this instance <e> <s> it is a matter

exaggerating when i say that there is a crisis in our midst in some parts of the country especially with regard to the mentally ill <e> <s> although more will always need to be done for those people

schizophrenia <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not pursue the argument <e> <s> i have made my point and i think the noble lord has probably made his <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord might like to suggest that such proceeds should be sent to the new charity which i mentioned sane <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in general in favour of the bill as drafted and welcome it <e> <s> however there is one worry and that is that it does not fully protect all persons who might in certain circumstances be attacked by a mentally ill person who has access under the provisions of clause to a medical report even if restricted under the terms of the clause <e> <s> i should add that i am advised in this respect by the national schizophrenia fellowship <e>", "<cs> my lords i always enjoy the fierceness with which the noble lord lord bruce seeks to convince his opponents <e> <s> somehow i feel that fierceness is not the best way to impress people <e>", "<cs> my lords i always find it sad to follow the noble lord lord rugby on these occasions because he has this extraordinary bitter and implacable opposition to opticians and to their valuable contribution to health care in the modern day <e> <s> to quote for example from mr neville chamberlain over years ago when things were rather different and even to go back to the greeks is not particularly relevant now <e> <s> but if the noble lord will allow me i shall not pursue that now as i have other things to say and we can perhaps return to it at committee stage <e> <s> but it is very sad and i hope that one day he will come to see that his view is rather excessive in a very narrow direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend has had the opportunity to read the article written by sir hector laing which appeared in <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that what the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale is proposing seems most sensible and i hope therefore that my noble friend will be able to give it the right kind of reception <e> <s> i should like especially to thank my noble friend for the letters he wrote to me and the national schizophrenia fellowship recently covering this amendment and others <e>", "<cs> my

noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that in march of last year mr john major expected to implement section during and that in march of this year mrs currie proposed to implement it as soon as possible <e> <s> is what he is now saying not a little dilatory in view of the promises of his colleagues in another place last year and this year <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend pay particular attention to the fact that this whole process is distressing to the carers of the mentally ill and mentally handicapped and indeed to the sufferers as well <e> <s> there may be all kinds of administrative reasons but will he not take to heart the fact that people need to have this information and that there might be a little more genuine effort to produce the reports as promised in earlier times <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is she aware that the amount of moneys owed to food processing companies as a result of these delays is of the order of million for this year <e> <s> one big company is owed million and in recent weeks has received a cheque for and concurrently an invoice for <e> <s> is she further aware that the problem is cash flow particularly for small companies and now indeed for the big companies <e> <s> some small companies have ceased taking up export opportunities because of this delay <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend on her ability to deal with this problem she is defending the indefensible <e> <s> does she agree that her argument against advance payments was not convincing and that it was put up by bureaucrats who ought to be tamed <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support what my noble friend said <e> <s> i apologise to your <e>", "<cs> my lords the danger is that if a chap aged about when this presbyopia comes in buys a pair of specs like this and they are not quite right he may say to himself i have not been able to see on the road very well and i will wear these for driving too <e> <s> the shop he has been to will not have told him that the glasses are unsuitable because it is just a common retailer and the staff are not experts as optometrists are <e> <s> he will therefore feel free to use those glasses for the kinds of purposes for which they are not intended <e> <s> it is all very well to say that people will know at once that they cannot see so well and will take them off that will not necessarily be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords to a certain extent the noble lord is right <e> <s> in those large countries the answer is yes if the figures are taken in their totality but if one takes specific areas like the built-up urban areas of the united states one will find that the number of traffic accidents is higher than in this country <e> <s> therefore that particular argument is not a very good one <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there are some benefits for this country from the air traffic control position because there is some evidence that people were so fed up with waiting at airports that they took their holidays in britain instead in particular on the isle of wight <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to say how much i agree with both my noble friend the minister and the noble lord lord ennals that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to thank my noble friend for the amendments

supposed to speak once and that is it <e> <s> noble lords can explain this kind of matter to each other outside the chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say to your lordships and to the noble viscount that i am only interested in coming in on the first part of what the noble viscount is talking about as to why the new clause should not be there <e> <s> i am not interested at all in the second part of his amendment <e> <s> would it be possible for me to speak when the noble viscount has spoken to his first part and for us all to deal with that <e> <s> the second part could then perhaps be dealt with separately <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support the argument of the noble viscount <e> <s> i was involved in this subject nearly months ago in regard to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that was in committee on th december surely making this one of the longest considerations of a bill ever <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as a supporter of the amendment i should like to say a few words <e> <s> however my noble friend the leader of the house rose and i should not like to speak after him <e> <s> many of my noble friends particularly those whom i respect a great deal

knew some of the people involved in the case <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not i who asked that <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend say when a government of either party will transfer some large government office to the isle of wight <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord carter for introducing this motion because it is necessary to make everyone continually aware of the problem both for themselves and for the carers for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped <e> <s> noble lords will be aware that my particular interest is in the problems of schizophrenia and that i am advised in these matters by the national schizophrenia fellowship <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i did not say that the policy was a mistake as regards the mentally handicapped <e> <s> i was speaking entirely about the mentally ill <e> <s> i believe that it has been a mistake to go so fast in their case <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will permit me <e>", "<cs> i simply wished to suggest that perhaps the noble lord might care to put forward his very useful contribution on my amendment no <e> <s> which is the next amendment to be discussed and relates to just that point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for his undertaking to look at this and to provide another amendment on the lines which he has just described <e> <s> i am

meston said our two amendments similarly tackle the problem of making sure that welfare reports do not rely unreasonably on hearsay <e>", "<cs> i was disappointed that my noble and learned friend did not give my amendment no <e> <s> a more reasonable chance <e> <s> some of his arguments against amendment no <e> <s> gave amendment no <e> <s> a validity which it might not otherwise have possessed <e> <s> however i was not frightfully encouraged by his suggestion that the regulations under subsection might include what was relevant out of these two amendments <e> <s> the general sense of subsection deals with regulations in a different area altogether <e> <s> i very much hope that my noble and learned friend will have a good look at what has been said on this point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady david for her contribution and assistance and for her rather fuller statement <e> <s> what my noble and learned friend said is worth studying before one decides what to do next <e> <s> this is not the stage to press the point but we may find that it would be wise to come back to it at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for his explanation and indeed to all other noble lords who have joined in this very interesting debate <e> <s> the problem is that colloquially the phrase children in need does not quite mean in peoples minds what subsection says it means <e> <s> i can see why my noble and learned friend says that the draftsman has to choose something as his starting point and that what he has chosen are probably the best words possible <e> <s> but it is a pity that there is a colloquial understanding of children in need which confuses the issue <e>", "<cs> i wish to support in principle what the noble lord has just said about taking the relevant parts out of schedule and putting them in the main body of the bill <e> <s> i have a series of amendments <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> to which seek to do that as well <e> <s> but they seek to do that rather more bluntly and not in such a delicate style <e> <s> more importantly they seek to put them into part i the general principles of the bill <e> <s> we believe them to be so important that we think that is the more suitable place for them <e> <s> however in principle i go with the noble lord that we are taking them out of schedule where they do not really belong <e>", "<cs> once again i thank all members of the committee who have taken part including those who disagreed with me <e> <s> it has been very helpful in trying to refine the difficulties of this problem <e>", "<cs> i understand what my noble and learned friend says and i should dearly like to think that this was the end of the subject <e> <s> but the fact is that the nspcc which operates all over the country and is not getting at any particular local authority i hasten to add that as far as i know my own local authority is in this area entirely right in its judgment of these points has made it clear that some local authorities are not providing the services for the under-fives that a lot of people think they should be doing <e> <s> perhaps it is beyond us to ensure by act of parliament that those services are provided <e> <s> perhaps this is an opportunity to air the point and go no further <e> <s> however i think it is unfortunate that we cannot find some way of inserting this to provide some kind of a grip on local authorities which are not providing the services for

side of the chamber <e> <s> i say happily because on the back benches it is much more fun to be in opposition than in government <e> <s> i can remember many occasions and perhaps the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones who then sat on the woolsack remembers some of them also in which i fought the battle for may and shall <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a welcome fact that the government are discussing section with the local authorities <e> <s> can my noble friend give us an idea of when he thinks these discussions will be concluded and action will begin to be taken on this part of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for giving me a run-in to the problems that we have in the isle of wight over possible mergers <e> <s> i shall not say very much about it because it is not the matter of the bill <e> <s> however it is a fact as he said that it would be a disaster for the isle of wight if anything adverse should happen to the plessey factory in cowes not only from the point of view of unemployment and the workforce in the island as a whole but also as regards the balance of the community because plesseys in the isle of wight plays an important part in giving us a balance of intellectual stamina and expert qualifications which are not reflected in other companies <e> <s> it is very important although it is something

points <e> <s> i do not know whether the people who advised me will find that but my inclination would be not to pursue this further and perhaps to come back to it at a later stage if that were necessary <e>", "<cs> having read this excellent clause very thoroughly it seems to me that the particular point covered by the amendment is omitted from the clause as it now stands <e> <s> there is a great deal to be said for the new proposed subsection which would round off the clause and make sure that the local authority takes the extra trouble that the amendment implies <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say to my noble and learned friend that i do not think necessarily that subsection <e>", "<cs> i should have liked to speak separately to the first half of amendment no <e> <s> as distinct from the second half <e> <s> no doubt it was put together because it looked neat to those in the public bill office <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i shall concentrate on the first part of the amendment which goes with what we are now discussing but on the assumption that my noble and learned friend has been given advice on how to comment on the whole amendment i shall say a few words about the second part later <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> the national institute for social work and the national consumer council which work together have shown that

noble and learned friends anxiety about making the provision too wide <e> <s> on the other hand i suggest that the fact that a junior member of staff and a grandparent for example are not covered by subsection is a fault of that subsection and it needs to include more people <e> <s> our attempt to describe them in the words <e>", "<cs> that is very kind of my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i am

add to the references that are given therein <e> <s> it might be necessary at times to add to the provisions in paragraph <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord henderson was indicating that but he has put his name to an amendment which sweeps away the whole of subsection <e> <s> i should have understood it more if it had swept away only the first half of subsection and allowed the addition of various provisions <e> <s> i should have thought that that was sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend for his careful explanation and to those noble lords who have supported the amendment <e> <s> i think the important point about the amendment is the uncertainty that exists about this whole area in relation to certain local authorities <e> <s> as my subsequent amendents will show we are seeking ways and means of making sure that local authorities concentrate on the duties which the bill identifies without unduly placing too great an imposition on

are not going too far <e> <s> i think that there is too much of a feeling that corporal punishment is bad and ought to be abolished altogether <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson said that one of

bringing something into the bill if he can at some stage to take care of the point that i am trying to make <e>", "<cs> my lords with that understanding i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for our general agreement on the principle of that amendment <e> <s> however in view of the fact that he said it would be more suitable in

lady lady kinloss for her support and my noble and learned friend for so carefully considering this matter <e> <s> i accept the fact that my amendment as it stands is flawed because of the second

affirmative procedure for cancellations deletions i forget what the phrase is rather than additions <e> <s> an addition could be negative procedure in this case <e> <s> much more i should like to

lord lord williams just pointed out <e> <s> however i should like to emphasise why the cbi believes that the many sections which are covered by subsection a c and d of this new clause need to be dealt with if they are going to be dealt with by regulation by the affirmative rather than the negative procedure <e>", "<cs> i was not arguing against regulations <e> <s> i was saying that they should be

and indicating that he will give further consideration to it as the bill progresses through parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to give my congratulations and thanks to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for having steered the bill and us through a long period of consideration <e> <s> he has accepted a great deal and promised a great deal much of which has reached fruition <e> <s> it is a much better bill than it was when it arrived here <e> <s> i should like to thank him on my behalf and that of the nspcc which has asked me to do so <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend on the cross-benches if i can so describe her lady kinloss for helping with the amendments that we have tabled together <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment of my noble friend lord caldecote <e> <s> i think that his argument was very convincing indeed particularly on the points he made about the practice in the united states <e> <s> the cbi is neutral its members say that they detect a possibility that the proposal would need a great deal of work <e> <s> i do not suppose that matters because people have to work but it is about the only adverse factor

paragraph b with the word it <e> <s> what is it <e> <s> it seems to me that if one reads back it is the subsidiary undertaking at the beginning of subsection <e> <s> that makes a nonsense of the amendment <e> <s> i am sorry but that just stuck in my gullet <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just make a few remarks as regards both these amendments <e> <s> the cbi which advises me is particularly keen that i should enter the lists for putting forward its viewpoint on this matter <e> <s> it definitely took the government side the last time this amendment came before us at the committee stage <e> <s> having read over the subject again i congratulate the noble lord lord williams for getting the government to withdraw their own rather lengthy amendment <e> <s> they rarely do so <e> <s> one can sometimes get them to say that they will think about it or even do something but to get them to withdraw it was quite an achievement <e> <s> however i see that they have reintroduced an amendment which is identical in all but a couple of words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for taking note of what i did not in fact say in committee <e> <s> that situation arose because my advice arrived too late <e> <s> if one were to look in <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely wish to mention that the cbi is aware of this matter <e> <s> it made this point through one of its members and it is delighted to see it in the bill <e> <s> i endorse the thoughts of the cbi on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support the amendment that the noble lord lord benson has moved <e> <s> it seems to me that this is a straight matter of english <e> <s> i hope that my noble friends on the front bench are not over-persuaded by the original drafter because it seems to me that the english requires it to be as the noble lord would have it <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment is grouped with my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is the same as that tabled by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran in committee <e> <s> the amendment which i then tabled was heard in conjunction with it <e> <s> this general matter must be taken in the round as between the various answers <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down in view of the fact that if his amendment is accepted my amendment cannot be called perhaps i may make a concluding remark about my reading of it having heard what my noble friend had to say <e> <s> i do not think that the matter is resolved <e> <s> i do not like my noble friends amendment but my inclination is to let it ride with the firm intention of coming back to amend it at the next stage of the bill having taken into account all that has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords it should be remembered that this is the report stage we have not yet reached the committee stage <e>", "<cs> putting an industry point of view this amendment is very unwelcome <e> <s> it brings non-executive directors into legislation and though industry is in favour of non-executive directors it is not in favour of non-executive directors by statute <e> <s> certain companies need a balance of non-executive directors but others do not <e> <s> it is important not to fetter companies too tightly in that general area <e>", "<cs> you would <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to say that having been well educated by the government chief whip i take great care not to say that i speak for the cbi <e> <s> i say that the cbi advises me <e> <s> that is a different matter because i speak for myself <e>", "<cs> i am told that these amendments have been considered by the small businesses council of the cbi in the sense that it considered the dtis consultative document based on the institute of directors proposals <e> <s> as a result of that consideration the cbi tells me that it agrees in principle with the introduction of written resolutions for private companies and with the elective regime for private companies as outlined in the original consultative document <e> <s> however this is in part due to the lack of time to consider these amendments and the cbi would like to examine the reasons put forward in todays debate to see what action if any to take in relation to recommending any other amendments in the future <e> <s> in principle the cbi and i agree with the kind of amendments that the government have put before us <e>", "<cs> i agree with one point only raised by the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> he said that this is an important amendment <e> <s> i believe that it is extremely dangerous <e> <s> it is yet another attempt similar to those that we have seen in recent months to strike at the effectiveness of the unitary board <e> <s> i shall direct my remarks particularly to the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> i shall endeavour not to speak to a brief but to what he said <e> <s> does he not believe that having some people on a unitary board who are selected by statute and nominated by a group of shareholders as he explained it is dangerous for the cohesion co-operation and efficiency of the board <e>", "<cs> the danger i see is that the proposal would make the ordinary unitary board more inefficient <e> <s> there is a risk that some of its members would be stooges of the people who nominated them <e> <s> that is what i believe is dangerous <e> <s> i believe the whole concept to be dangerous <e> <s> but the real danger in this way of proceeding is that the people concerned would not or could not be independent in the true sense <e> <s> some of them will be but they could be subject to manipulation from outside <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to that point <e> <s> the best advice that i ever received concerning a large public company was that its board should be made up of about one third executive directors one third non-executive directors with wide experience of many businesses like the noble lord and one third principal shareholders <e> <s> that is the best balance but god forbid that that should be laid in statute <e> <s> that formula happens to suit several companies but not every one <e>", "<cs> not yet <e>", "<cs> the cbi advised me on this matter <e> <s> i feel that the legislation needs to be altered here as the noble lord lord hacking said <e> <s> however the cbi finds it difficult to decide on exactly the form that an amendment to alter the legislation should take <e> <s> i should be grateful to hear the comments of my noble friend on the front bench to show the governments thinking on this matter at the moment <e> <s> all one can say definitely is that some changes are necessary <e> <s> it is another matter whether the changes in this amendment are the precise changes that are needed <e>", "<cs> i understand that we are speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> c c and c as well as to amendment no <e> <s> c <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> c stands in my name

<e> <s> i shall not seek to comment further except to say that there seems no good reason for sweeping away so much <e> <s> it is not just a bit of regulation here and there <e>", "<cs> are we really talking about a p stamp <e> <s> this seems to be a most ridiculous argument <e> <s> i have a great deal of respect for the noble lord lord monson in other ways more so than i respect many other noble lords <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has made some good points about family and joint shares but i do not think this amendment deals with that as such <e> <s> presumably private companies are limited in what they can do <e> <s> whether or not that is so this amendment goes too far <e>", "<cs> that is the point i make <e> <s> the word private should therefore be removed from the clause heading <e> <s> it is misleading <e> <s> however i do not want to waste time as we have already wasted far too much time <e>", "<cs> that is right but in the meantime i hope that the committee will resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> interestingly the cbi has advised me about another case not the case quoted by the noble lord lord hacking <e> <s> the cbi believes that it raises a number of questions that go to the heart of the ruling in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am baffled <e> <s> my noble friend has responded to everybodys speech

my noble friend said nothing <e> <s> i do not blame him i blame his department <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i was about to come on to that point <e> <s> however that is only one point which could be dealt with by amendment in committee <e> <s> i explained why we started off with one specific kind of mental illness <e> <s> i am sorry that my noble friend did not take up my explanations regard <e>", "<cs> my lords the cbi has considered this matter and it supports the amendment <e> <s> we believe it to be a definite improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for explaining at such length the thinking behind not accepting my amendment and indeed for explaining the thinking behind this part of the bill <e> <s> it sounded to me as if his argument was a good one but naturally i shall need to study it with great care <e> <s> it is possible that the matter may be re-opened at a later date <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was told that not long ago in a case that shall be nameless the trade unions concerned wrote to the commission and were not rebuffed <e> <s> there were other interested parties who did the same <e> <s> there was apparently no need for legislation to make this possible <e> <s> even if it is a question of importance that people should be sought out i should have thought that the amendment provided a little nannying <e> <s> if people have a strong view about a merger in relation to their company it is up to them to take the initiative <e> <s> if they do not have such a feeling then jolly bad luck <e> <s> but i do not think that one needs to have legislation which provides that these people are sought out <e> <s> the other people involved in the case i mentioned would not be covered by this amendment but they still took the initiative and were not rebuffed <e>", "<cs> my lords although this is the report stage perhaps i may say that i am not speaking on behalf of the cbi <e> <s> i am speaking from personal experience <e>", "<cs> my lords as i obviously have not sat down the answer is that i am quoting from personal experience <e> <s> i should have thought that the situation which i have experienced could well happen again <e> <s> i do not think that one needs to use the legislation to help people along in the way that is intended as i said earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree that there are many opportunities for women to be on boards of directors of companies and that they should be encouraged <e> <s> however i suggest that the phraseology of this third try is inappropriate because of its reference to the sex discrimination act <e> <s> the act was formulated to deal with the particular relationship between employers and employees <e> <s> it appears inappropriate to extend it to the relationship between the boards of directors and their shareholders <e> <s> the obligations and duties of directors far exceed the obligations of an employee to a company <e> <s> i believe as does the cbi which advises me that the introduction of sex discrimination provisions to the appointment of directors under that act is inappropriate and it should be opposed by your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords the sex discrimination act was intended to deal with the situation between employers and employees <e> <s> the relationship between directors and their companies is different so it is an inappropriate use <e> <s> i believe that the noble baroness must try again with a different approach but it must be in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose the amendment for the same reasons that i gave at report stage <e> <s> the question of cost is not a point <e> <s> the cbi has advised me that this is a quite unnecessary additional statutory burden

my lords i thank my noble friend the secretary of state and my noble friend lord strathclyde for the courtesy with which they accommodated the amendments which i put forward on my own behalf and as advised by the cbi for accepting what they could and for explaining what they could not <e> <s> i also greatly enjoyed debating with noble lords opposite the more especially when we were in disagreement <e> <s> i thought that what might be called a rather over-encompassing bill covering such a wide range went through with much greater overall courtesy and accommodation between the two sides than perhaps it might have done <e> <s> i think that that is a matter for congratulation to everybody who took part to any extent <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> in a way i am surprised at this amendment because i do not think that it is necessary <e> <s> if the bill were to take effect without this machinery to

must come first <e> <s> that is the whole point <e> <s> i did not gather from my noble friend whether when the guidelines are prepared consultations will be made with the sort of people who will be involved in the whole issue for example the charities concerned with schizophrenics and so on so that the government really make sure that the guidelines meet the needs of the people rather than meet the needs of the people who write them <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord ennals for saying that he is not gunning for clause and is in fact gunning for the other factors <e> <s> however i would put forward this point in favour of why the bill is in its present form <e> <s> i said at second reading that it was important to us to tackle the problem for one group of people <e> <s> perhaps i may quote what the right reverend prelate the bishop of sheffield said during that debate <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lords lord ennals and lord young for their contributions <e> <s> i guessed that that was why the noble lord lord ennals sought to remove subsection <e> <s> my advisers and i have been looking at the point <e> <s> it is a good idea to have the provision in the bill provided that it is qualified so as to get over the points that have just been raised and with which i entirely agree <e> <s> if the noble lord agrees i suggest that we leave the subsection in the bill and that i come back on report with an amendment which i shall now try to describe to the committee and which i believe gets over the problem <e> <s> if on report my amendment does not do that we can take the matter a step further <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> the object of the subsection is merely so that the patient who cannot be traced for whatever reason shall be given the utmost help to be traced so as to receive the after-care which the bill is all about <e> <s> it is entirely in the patients interests <e> <s> if for some reason the person who has the special knowledge does not think that disclosure is in the interests of the patient the amendment that i shall table on report would take care of that position <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the amendment would not only cover rivers but would also cover tidal waters <e> <s> yachts in tidal waters would be very seriously and unnecessarily inconvenienced by the width of this amendment <e> <s> i am not speaking for rivers but it is generally accepted by marine biologists that the amount of waste generated and discharged through sea toilets in tidal waters is so insignificant in volume as to have no effect whatever on the marine environment <e> <s> the southampton harbour bylaws recognise that <e> <s> therefore it seems to me that perhaps my noble friend may bring forward another amendment to cover rivers but this is too sweeping an amendment because it also involves tidal harbours <e> <s> i hope that the government will not accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i suggest to my noble friend that it is confusing the issue to bring in the question of oil at sea <e> <s> we are discussing tidal waters and yachts <e> <s> my noble friend is suggesting that it is a new privilege as it were which is to be given all we are seeking is to make sure that the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a privilege to follow the noble lord lord northbourne <e> <s> i must confess that i found his arguments most persuasive <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will take them away for consideration and deep study not necessarily in relation to the bill i suspect that it is too late to do anything on that front but for the long-term process of dealing with child benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a typically fierce speech given by the noble lord lord northfield <e> <s> is it not funny that he has this real bee in his bonnet as has the noble lord lord rugby about spectacles <e> <s> spectacles are things which we do not have to buy every week as we do bottles of wine or food <e> <s> in the ordinary course of events even when you reach my great age and perhaps even the noble lords great age you do not have to buy spectacles more than every two years <e> <s> i have had my present spectacles for about three years and they are doing me no harm <e> <s> therefore it is much more equivalent to buying say a motor car it is not like buying food <e> <s> there is no need to see the matter as being a scandal where people are being put in a state of penury as a result of having to spend once a week in order to buy a pair of spectacles <e> <s> it is not like that <e>", "<cs> it is that type of thing <e> <s> it is not unreasonable for certain types of goods to be produced by professionals who are in competition the one with the other <e> <s> opticians have been doing that all along <e>", "<cs>

homing in on the word actively <e> <s> why is that so important <e> <s> from what the noble lord lord stallard has just been saying most of the people i know are actively seeking work so why take

position of this kind <e> <s> it is possible that after a time they get terribly weary about seeking a job but they are still potentially able actively to do so <e> <s> the paper which the noble earl lord russell and i have had from my noble friend on the front bench talks about the steps to be taken <e> <s> they are all logical steps and that is what i understand the word actively to mean <e>", "<cs> why not <e>", "<cs> we must not spend too long on this amendment <e> <s> i shall talk to the noble earl outside <e>", "<cs> i disagree with my noble friend <e> <s> i think that these amendments are right in principle although i agree with the noble baroness lady turner that the wording could perhaps be improved <e> <s> i think that the view just expressed by my noble friend is theoretical rather than practical <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will give sympathetic consideration to these amendments <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is barking up the wrong tree <e> <s> the subsection says that the offence must be <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> i am most grateful to the many noble lords who have supported the bill it does two things

with other noble lords a dinghy race on the thames between your lordships yacht club and our neighbours the yacht club of the house of commons the time to do so is about pm tomorrow from the library

"<cs> my lords the house of lords beat the house of commons in the sailing race today <e> <s> however i did not contribute much to the win because although i finished the course i capsized and was rather a long way back <e>", "<cs> i am shown on the marshalled list as wishing to oppose the clause altogether <e> <s> however to enable business to proceed faster for us all it might be better to have a general debate on the basis that the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale has put forward a complete argument not only for his own amendments but also for striking out the clause <e> <s> in fact

that if he has detailed comments to make he should keep them for report stage when we shall return to the charge <e>", "<cs> i think that this is a rather rigid view of what may be only a two-year problem <e> <s> it is all very well to say that one has to slick to ones guns but it will cause enormous trouble and a great deal of expense for the people who have arranged the pension schemes for something which everyone agrees has to be put right in any event <e> <s> my noble friend said that the position would be rectified in a social security bill in two years hence but in the meantime the damage would have been done <e>", "<cs> do i understand from that that because this part of the bill will not be enacted for another four years there is time to make the correction in the meantime <e>

whether it knew the attitude of the commission in brussels <e> <s> i gather that the commission is totally relaxed about the matter and will not invoke desperate actions against us because our intentions are the same as the commissions intentions <e> <s> although it is only an unofficial discussion at this stage at the working level the commission was rather surprised that we were so fussed about the matter particularly when it was explained that the whole principle of our integrated pensions is the equality which is central to the issue <e>", "<cs> i am speaking now to amendment no <e>

i thank my noble friend for his comments <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the amendment may not be perfect and may be placed in a wrong part of clause <e> <s> i shall therefore read with care what my

withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have put down my objection to clause <e> <s> it seems to the employers in northern ireland that clause although it is worded in the way that it is is the legalisation of quotas by another name quotas being preconceived ideas of how many people of a particular type should be employed regardless of their qualifications or their past record of doing their job well in the area in which employers need to employ them <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for his explanation <e> <s> i shall read it with care and see what might happen at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i am advised that in the past the fea has happily and frequently changed the goalposts <e> <s> it has often recommended action to one employer but not to another in similar circumstances <e> <s> in cases where things looked in order overall it probed until it found something wrong <e> <s> i suggest that that is not the way to gain the co-operation of employers <e> <s> it is feared that clause is very much a cover-all clause giving the commission more or less unlimited power to call for any other information or action that it thinks fit <e> <s> for example could the fair employment commission call for an employer to conduct training for non-employees <e> <s> it would seem that within the terms of clause it could <e> <s> it would be nice to be reassured about that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that explanation <e> <s> i shall take advice at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that explanation which i shall read with care <e>

worded differently <e>", "<cs> i must point out that my amendments will not take away paragraph c they in fact take away one phrase at the end of subsection and paragraph e of subsection <e>", "<cs> i hasten to add in response to the noble lords lord prys-davies and lord bonham-carter that they have got the wrong message in this regard <e> <s> if they would be kind enough to refer back to what i said on second reading they will understand that the cbi in northern ireland is right behind the bill and has been so from the beginning <e> <s> however in so doing the cbi is saying that it has not

withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend tell me how this training under the altered clause will be paid for <e> <s> will it be paid for by the government or will there be a hidden charge on industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend very much for this statement which i think is good so far as it goes <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate him and his right honourable and honourable friends on producing the statement before the summer recess <e> <s> at one moment it seemed that we might not have it and i like to think that perhaps my schizophrenia after-care bill had some effect in hurrying it up <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to support what the noble lord lord allen has just said <e> <s> as has already been pointed out by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway i have no time for modification and i would not support my noble friends amendment because it seeks to retain what i consider to be a fundamental flaw

point <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but he has now sat down <e>", "<cs> my lords the crux of this matter to which my noble friend has not addressed himself is the fact that he assumes in the words of the beveridge report that double compensation is bad <e> <s> the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale has gone along with the pearson commission <e> <s> but why is double compensation bad <e> <s> i give an example at the risk of my noble friend introducing legislation to change the position <e> <s> i receive two pensions to both of which i have indirectly contributed <e> <s> one is paid by the

two sets of contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his answer <e> <s> as i understand it there will be communication with the commission <e> <s> it may be that some amendment

what is being done is quite extraordinary since there is already a system of fair employment in being <e> <s> it is not as though it were a new concept and had to be rushed through and brought into force before the summer recess for any reason that i can see in the bill itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord is fully seized in introducing the amendment as he has with the fact that transferring the oversight of the commission to the secretary of state might be seen by some people in northern ireland as transferring control as it were from people in northern ireland to people in england <e> <s> certainly that view has been expressed to me <e> <s> it would mean that the commission was even more independent and not under any more governmental control than it already is <e> <s> this might mean that it was more difficult to deal with <e>", "<cs> my lords while while i welcome the underlying theme of the amendment i am a little doubtful about the specific areas which have been picked for inclusion <e> <s> i was talking about the public sector of the industrial public sector in particular <e> <s> it does not seem to me that a nationalised industry or a public undertaking would necessarily be covered by this <e> <s> i should like to see them so covered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for spelling out in considerable detail exactly the safeguards which employers have <e> <s> i am satisfied that they can use them under the circumstances which they fear <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly i think that employers would prefer the wording in

was his amendment <e> <s> he did not say that it was the noble lords amendment <e> <s> he got muddled <e> <s> we are dealing with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe employers will welcome the amendment as a very reasonable extra freedom for them <e> <s> they have been boxed in by this bill much more than is in many cases reasonable <e> <s> my noble friends explanation for the amendment is a very sound one <e> <s> i hope your lordships will agree to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the abolition of the six months rule for attendance allowance <e> <s> can my noble friend say whether this will be retrospective <e> <s> it would have been helpful to my family if it had been done a year ago <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept my noble friends arguments about type is he happy that there are enough frigates and destroyers <e> <s> the government have said that they will have around <e> <s> we now find that that means operationally fewer than <e> <s> can my noble friend reassure us that the government are bothered about having enough frigates and destroyers to do the job that they have in hand at any one time <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that last

support amendment no <e> <s> that is without the refinements just <e>", "<cs> my lords this is my amendment <e> <s> observing what my noble and learned friend has just said it seems to be the philosophy behind this part of the bill to encourage parents to feel confident that arrangements for the provision of accommodation will be entirely voluntary on their part provided only that certain

amendments to which he has just been referring and also in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we were talking earlier about an amendment to that <e> <s> it is splendid the way after all this time my noble and learned friend has come up with a solution which is flexible enough to be made to work <e> <s> it will be very interesting to see how it goes <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to say very briefly that the nspcc advises me that it supports the principle that an alleged offender should be removed from the home rather than the child but for the reasons which my noble and learned friend gave at some length it has not yet seen a draft which fully meets the requirements to satisfy the childs safety the offenders civil rights and the financial position of the family <e> <s> i should like to tell the house what the societys founder benjamin waugh said in <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a difficult amendment to discuss <e> <s> the organisations that work in this field have been concerned from the beginning that the bill did not include anything about day care <e> <s> the government responded splendidly to that concern but because they responded so late and because of what went on in another place which was outwith the control of the bill there has been no opportunity properly to discuss the clause and all that goes with it in the way that it normally would be discussed through each stage

courts <e> <s> he mentioned them in passing in his introduction but i see no reference to them in the next <e> <s> will the family court subsume the juvenile courts or will they continue to function in the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one small question <e> <s> i observe that very little of clause applies to scotland <e> <s> do the government have plans to update the childrens legislation for scotland concurrently with this legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment for the reasons given by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i too am advised by the cbi <e>

as allowing companies to insure officers and auditors against liability for breaches of duty <e> <s> the confederation has campaigned vehemently for this modification of section of the companies act and is most pleased to support the government in introducing the amendment which clarifies the law in this area <e> <s> i trust therefore that noble lords opposite will understand and appreciate what is proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that this question and many of the supplementary questions asked by those who support the anti-optician campaign are more in the interests of the commercial advantage of companies such as those mentioned in the original question than in the interests of consumers and the people who have trouble with their eyes <e> <s> does she also agree that the present situation provides a measure of competition and that there is no need to press this matter further by going back to the office of fair trading or any such body <e> <s> does she consider that there is probably more harm being done to the eyes of people in this country as a result of this campaign than is reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to declare an interest because i

back to the chamber used that phrase in a derogatory fashion <e> <s> he did not say that it is right that it should be so but that it is wrong that it should be so <e> <s> it was that which i was picking up rather than a technical phrase <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for her very detailed explanation which i shall read with great care <e> <s> my immediate thought is that it probably

organisations for the mentally ill as opposed to the mentally handicapped is my noble friend aware that the national schizophrenia fellowship in bournemouth has sought approval to convert a house to act as a hostel for schizophrenic patients in that area <e> <s> is she further aware that notwithstanding many efforts two successive houses were chosen but in each case the planning committee of the

she say whether the government can bring some pressure to bear to get the bournemouth district council to act as good christians <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the noble earl lord baldwin terribly misled himself and is he not misleading us by taking one american report on fluoride which suggests that it may cause cancer and trying to leave in your lordships minds presumably having it in his

its peak <e> <s> that was based on improved productivity of per cent per annum in the s and more than twice that in the s <e> <s> this halted the decline of earlier years and started to make british

authorities do not have secure facilities and who in each authority is responsible for providing and planning these facilities <e> <s> can she also say whether progress in this area is regularly monitored by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend not aware that there has been considerable pressure from the united states and the cairns group

is it not the case that there is quite considerable concern that the commission in giving consideration to the proposal is not being sufficiently strong in resisting it <e> <s> is it also true that the british government have not been particularly firm in encouraging the commission to be strong <e> <s> can my noble friend comment on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend perhaps take the point made by the noble lord lord gallacher and invite her right honourable friend to suggest to the commission that there is much room for improvement within the common agricultural policy

noble friend has understood me <e> <s> i am not suggesting a compulsory treatment order to keep people in hospital <e> <s> the suggested legislation would give power to the minister to introduce an

do not readily accept names from the other side of the house because they tend to diminish my amendments <e> <s> i am cautious about it <e> <s> however that is another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have not yet sat down i shall stand up again <e> <s> i take that generosity exactly as it is given and i accept it on this one occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that my amendments have been dealt with properly <e> <s> i propose to speak to them and move them when we deal with the bill on thursday <e> <s> i hope that arrangements can be made to accept that position <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see amendment no <e> <s> as being consistent with what the noble lord lord kilmarnock has been saying <e> <s> what the amendment does before it puts in the reference to policy is to remove everything from line to line on page <e> <s> it takes out paragraph and the new subsection from section to which the noble lord was speaking <e>", "<cs> my lords let us keep to the spirit of the rules <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that it is appropriate at report stage for the noble lord to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend had sat down and the noble lord did not intervene by saying before the noble lord sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether i might speak on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> is no one going to move amendment no <e> <s> as such <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might make a short speech on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have no views on amendment no <e> <s> but i have views on amendment no <e> <s> which is grouped with it <e> <s> i was very confused over what was discussed in committee on the forerunner to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it seemed to me although i did not take part in the debate that the movers and the government were not at all clear as to what clause would actually cover <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully endorse the remarks of the noble lord lord seebohm about this being probably the most important amendment <e> <s> for me it is certainly the most important amendment to the bill <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord seebohm for having suggested at committee stage that we should get together as we did <e> <s> we were able to have a meeting <e> <s> i thank the noble baroness lady hooper for meeting us to discuss it <e> <s> i hope that we were able to convince her and her officials that we were discussing a matter which requires some provision <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down perhaps i may ask her two <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not good enough <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend could say that this matter will be taken back and brought in as a government amendment at third reading <e> <s> would that not be something she could consider even at this late point <e>", "<cs> my lords although i was not involved in the lead-up to the amendment and have no amendments tabled in my name i am sure that amendment no <e> <s> a is just the sort of thing that the national schizophrenia fellowship would like <e> <s> i applaud my noble friend for having introduced it <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment as i supported its predecessor amendment no <e> <s> be in committee <e> <s> it seems rather strange that without the amendment the bill represents a step backwards because the services can only be provided if it appears to the local authority that they are necessary <e> <s> at the moment one can ask a local authority for help but there is nothing to make it comply <e> <s> the amendment would improve matters because the local authority would have an obligation to act <e> <s> obviously local authorities do not want that but the government should not be upset <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the principle of this amendment very strongly although i have reservations about the amendment itself <e> <s> respite care is immensely important for people with schizophrenia and their carers <e> <s> it is not good for either of them to spend all their time with the other <e> <s> they need time for themselves for independent activities and both need long periods apart from each of her and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords in principle i support all these amendments <e> <s> i shall not say more at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to support this amendment in principle <e> <s> i do not know so much about the details <e> <s> it would be extremely helpful to the national schizophrenia fellowship if we were to have some legislation of this nature <e> <s> as noble lords are aware schizophrenics are particularly difficult people to handle <e> <s> there is a pressing need in all the big and not so big city centres to have day centres to which people from the surrounding countryside from other boroughs districts within a county or even adjacent counties can attend <e> <s> it does not seem to me that the bill as <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend clarify further <e> <s> i gave an example of an organisation which wishes to have a day centre <e> <s> it is providing that service because for all sorts of reasons the local authority is not making provision <e> <s> however the people drawn into the centre come from many adjacent authority areas <e> <s> therefore from the definition which we have been given the people who attend the centre are resident in the area in which <e>", "<cs> my lords i find this discussion very difficult because amendment no <e> <s> a was grouped with amendment no <e> <s> b on thursday and no provision was made by those who made the grouping they are perhaps the ones to take note to include at that time amendments nos <e> <s> to which now cannot be called <e> <s> i shall not be able to make a long speech about my amendment no <e> <s> but i should like to say briefly that the section as drafted now before amendment no <e> <s> a is considered will not enable many private carers taking responsibility for those with schizophrenia to make representations to their local authority about the services which they have a power or duty to provide <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reaffirmation of the assurance and also for undertaking to look at the draft circular to see whether its wording can be improved <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike other noble lords i am happy with my noble friends explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am advised by the british radio and electronic equipment manufacturers association the cbi and the retail consortium <e> <s> i take a somewhat different view of what it has said to me from that which the noble lord lord williams said was conveyed to him <e> <s> i hope very much that this move to reinstate parts of the bill that were taken out in another place will not be proceeded with <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he agree with me that it is our invariable experience in this place that if we take a private members bill through and i have been doing this for a long time including the time when my party was in opposition the best thing that can happen to it is that it is not amended in any way <e> <s> this means that it does not have to be returned to another place <e> <s> however this bill will have to be amended because of amendment no <e> <s> and the other government amendments and that is the minimum amendment required <e>", "<cs> i too welcome the amendment and strongly support it <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will be able to accept its principle if not the detailed wording <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord rea said that some of us might find it difficult to adjust to the loss of an enemy <e> <s> i believe that the problem is that some of us are adjusting too quickly to the loss of an obvious enemy <e> <s> i thank my noble friend the minister for a clear exposition of the governments current thinking on defence with which i broadly agree <e> <s> i hope that they will stick to it <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the encouraging aspects of the statement was that the special grant for the mentally ill will be payable from st april next <e> <s> will my noble friend expand on what that covers particularly whether it will be restricted to what might be called pump priming of projects or whether it can be spent on community care and aid for carers <e>"]
