["<cs> my lords it has necessitated a careful appraisal of the priorities involving the abandonment of activities of lower or no priority and a reduced input to others <e> <s> but overall it is fair to say that the department is continuing to do its job without adverse effects on its efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords whether it is instructive or not is not for me to say <e> <s> a question was put to me and i have answered it <e> <s> as the noble lord asked further questions i will be glad to send him a written answer with the same details in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been no compulsory redundancy <e> <s> the target as was stated in the statement by the lord president on th december is for the department to save posts which would represent a saving in money of some million i estimate that the saving so far has been some million a year <e>", "<cs> my lords the term which is used one which i do not particularly like is natural wastage <e> <s> it refers to people who have retired have passed away have become ill or have found other employment people who for one reason or another of their own volition have left the department <e>", "<cs> my lords what they have done after they have left the department i really cannot answer <e> <s> but none of them has been made compulsorily redundant <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness lady phillips for her support <e> <s> it is from a most unexpected direction if i may say so but none the less very much welcome <e> <s> i must say that she put it so well <e> <s> it was exactly what i was trying to say but did not put quite so well <e> <s> but speaking from my own experience i never felt in any way second-class or whatever <e> <s> nor did the foundation governors in my experience ever try in any way to make us feel like that <e> <s> it may be i was very fortunate and of course coming from leeds i would not expect it to be otherwise <e> <s> but i must say that that is my experience <e> <s> the point that the noble lord <e> <s> lord parry made was very interesting but it does not get us away from the fact that there is still a basic statutory requirement on foundation governors and therefore there they are <e> <s> i still say again that i fear we cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord brooks of tremorfa i too was put on to the education committee in my first year in local government and like him i too eventually became the leader of my authority <e> <s> so it would seem that a basic prerequisite for potential leaders is to go on to the education committee in their first year <e>", "<cs> yes i entirely accept that but in practice it is surprising how local education authorities do in fact appoint so many of their members to so many governing bodies <e> <s> if the noble baroness lady david is making the point that they should not and that they ought to bring in more from other sources one can only agree with her <e>", "<cs> on the latter point it is not all local education authorities who treat service on the governing body as a designated duty for the purpose of attendance allowances <e> <s> but i do know as the noble lord says that there are some who do <e> <s> however it does really not change anything <e> <s> i hope that in the light of what has been said the noble lord lord brooks of tremorfa will be able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> in fact i thought this was a rather surprising amendment <e> <s> first it is in direct conflict with an amendment tabled by the labour opposition in committee in another place which sought to restrict local education authority appointees to no more than half the number of the governors <e> <s> secondly it would in spirit run directly counter to the kind of experimentation in the composition of governing bodies which we are already seeing in birmingham and other places and which until now i had thought was welcomed by all parties <e> <s> thirdly it would in practice be unworkable because it would not be possible in the case of a voluntary aided school to fulfil both the requirements of the amendment and the requirement in subsection that there should be a majority of foundation governors <e>", "<cs> i understand the noble lords intentions in seeking to establish through the governing body a link between schools and the areas from which the children who attend them come although i am bound to say that the force of this amendment contrasts very strongly with that of amendment no <e> <s> which is down in the names of noble lords opposite <e> <s> however i think that it would be wrong in principle to give one local education authority a statutory voice in the way another local education authority carried out its statutory responsibilities each lea must be responsible for its own schools <e> <s> the formulation proposed by the noble lords in their amendment is in any event unsatisfactory as the numbers attending a school from a neighbouring authority could vary on either side of per cent <e> <s> or any other figure for that matter from year to year leading to continual upheaval in the governing body of the school <e> <s> i too do not have a great deal to say on this amendment but i am sure that this is something we can and <e>", "<cs> i hardly think that the proposal would to quote the noble lord lord davies of leek <e>", "<cs> as for the sentiments there is no difference at all between us <e> <s> indeed during the debate in committee in another place my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state made it clear that we wholly agree with the sentiment behind the amendment <e> <s> however in the bill before this house we are seeking to leave the maximum flexibility in the hands of local education authorities <e> <s> i have no doubt that the right of appointment should rest with them and i think we can safely leave it to authorities in making appointments under either subsection or subsection of <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can let that go out <e> <s> the fact is that it all boils down to yes there is the agreement of everyone that the sentiments behind this amendment are what we want to see happen <e> <s> we are disagreeing on how it should happen and what effect the amendment might have to ensure that it did happen <e> <s> that is the issue <e> <s> one may always be able to pick out the odd situation where it would not be so but in the main the government are very anxious to leave it to the good sense and responsibility of the local authority <e> <s> we must stand on that in regard to this amendment <e>", "<cs> the taylor report recommended that the right of minor authorities to representation on the governing bodies of primary schools in their area should be discontinued <e> <s> however this was in the context of their more general recommendations concerning the composition of governing bodies and they went on to reaffirm the value of members drawn from such authorities <e> <s> reactions to the taylor report showed that the links between primary schools and their communities are often much valued and the last governments bill recognised this by retaining a right of appointment for minor authorities <e> <s> our approach to the composition of governing bodies differs markedly both from that recommended by taylor and from that of the last government but we share that governments views concerning the value of minor authority involvement in primary school governing bodies <e> <s> it is for this reason that we have continued their existing right of representation although in a form more in keeping <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first in order to help the noble lord lord leatherland give in detail the definition of a minor authority <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> the district council is not necessarily excluded <e> <s> it is prescriptive in this sense <e> <s> it is a question of the definition and in what circumstances it would fill the role of a minor authority <e> <s> i thought that the definition that i read out made the point of the circumstances in which it would do so but by itself this amendment and this part of the bill is referring to the minor authority as such <e> <s> i respectfully submit that that is what we must content ourselves with at this moment <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to ensure that the local education authority responsible for the maintenance of a controlled school shall always have a stronger voice on the governing body of that school than the foundation governors <e> <s> i think it is unnecessary however because the making of instruments for voluntary schools is a matter for the secretary of state who by virtue of section of the act must consult with the local <e>", "<cs> i should first explain that the amendment is defective as there is no provision in subsections or for the local education authority to make any appointments <e> <s> it is under subsection that a local education authority will make its appointments to the governing bodies of all maintained schools <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might deal with the points raised more or less in the sequence in which they were raised <e> <s> i entirely endorse what the noble lord lord parry said about the respect one would have for the noble lord lord heycock <e> <s> it goes without saying at all <e>", "<cs> perhaps that was slightly out of context <e> <s> i was referring to the matter of freedoms for local government generally <e> <s> i think that was the point i made <e> <s> i was referring to something else <e>", "<cs> i listened with interest to what the noble lord lord brooks said <e> <s> our aim in setting the size of school below which the minimum number of elected teacher governors need only be one rather than two was twofold to allow for the practical difficulties of electing two governors from a very small teaching staff in the smallest schools and to make it possible to keep down the overall size of the governing body in such schools <e> <s> the figure of was chosen not because leas wanted to be able to keep teacher governor numbers down in the larger schools falling below it but to help the voluntary school authorities to keep down the overall size of their governing bodies <e> <s> in their case the addition of a teacher means the addition of another foundation governor as well to keep their majority at the level set out in subsection <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> i should have thought the answer really is twofold <e> <s> first of all there is the point i made about the head teacher and secondly when you start to get to the really small schools you start to talk about grouping <e> <s> i should have thought that that was really the answer to my noble friend lord swinton <e> <s> either way i think the point is still valid either the head teacher or the grouping would be the answer <e>", "<cs> of course one could get grouping where you had a primary school and a smaller school on the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i must repeat that until we know from the outcome of the review the precise extent of the problem as it concerns and affects the two areas in question it would be difficult to say precisely what ought to be done <e> <s> it would be fair to say that the evidence would not seem to be as extensive as might be thought <e> <s> nevertheless to prejudge it and also to prejudge precisely what one would do about it would not be right <e> <s> clearly one must wait to see exactly what it is we are talking about <e> <s> if it should be that the burden is as great as my noble friend intimates and i repeat that we shall know only when we have the results of the review clearly we should want to look at it in the light of that <e>", "<cs> my lords what can we do but wait and see when we do not have the facts in front of us to indicate the extent of what we are talking about <e> <s> if it should prove to be as some would suggest quite minimal the burden on the ratepayers would not be as my noble friend suggests <e> <s> however if it is a burden of significance clearly the government would want to take that into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i should say at once that i did not in fact say that there was not a great burden on hillingdon <e> <s> i said that as yet we did not know quite what it was and that we wanted to know <e> <s> as for the other case to which the noble baroness referred i would point out that the court said that in those circumstances there was a duty to house <e> <s> however i think it would do no harm to make it quite clear that that is not so in every case <e> <s> this was the case of someone who was designated and given the status of a refugee <e> <s> in those circumstances the courts judge that there is a duty <e> <s> however it should also be stated that if it can be shown that the immigrant has not taken reasonable steps in advance to find accommodation there may indeed not be a duty to do other than find some temporary accommodation until such time as the person concerned can reasonably find himself something else <e> <s> therefore the matter is not as clear-cut as it might seem on the face <e>", "<cs> it is really a question of how far the noble baroness and the noble lord lord taylor of blackburn accept that local education authorities are responsible elected representative bodies who do not need their hand held in this way <e> <s> our policy on this side of the committee is to work on the assumption that leas will behave reasonably and to leave as much of the detailed arrangements as is possible in their hands <e> <s> in the case of elections of parent and teacher governors the only and crucial condition it seems necessary to lay down in statute is that elections shall be by secret ballot <e> <s> the matters stipulated in the amendment are only some of those which local education authorities will have responsibility for resolving <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord parry referred to what he called the dilemma facing the government <e> <s> i was not aware that the government were facing a dilemma on this issue least of all on this amendmentwe may face dilemmas on some others but certainly not on this one <e> <s> he also said that local government was moving away from the people <e> <s> i suppose that is a view but i think everyone in the committee is concerned to ensure that that should not be so and i do not think there is anything in the bill that will do other if that is the case than bring it closer <e> <s> in any event if anybody has experience of organising and running elections it must be the local authorities <e> <s> they have great experience of this as i know <e> <s> my noble friend lord swinton referred to the question of expense and i am grateful to him for making that point <e> <s> certainly there would be greater expense if we were to follow the lines proposed in the amendment but in all honesty that is not the prime reason for us not waiting to accept it <e> <s> nevertheless my noble friend made an important point <e>", "<cs> i understand the noble baronesss reasons for proposing the amendment even though as drafted it would not achieve the effect that she has in mind <e> <s> i certainly agree that the most obvious case in which it would be sensible to group two primary schools is where a junior and infants school share the same site <e> <s> but there may be other circumstances where local authorities would wish to do this and yet again it seems to the government sensible to leave this to the discretion of the local education authorities for local determination in the light of local circumstances <e>", "<cs> when anyone says to me even in leeds i usually respond by saying especially in leeds <e> <s> but on this occasion i think i must say again that the thrust of this point so far as the government are concerned is that i am fairly sure that local education authorities would resent this removal of a discretion that they have at present in this matter <e> <s> it really comes down to a point that we debated again and again yesterday and which no doubt we shall debate yet again and again before the week is out <e> <s> it is a question of how far one is willing to leave the matter to the discretion of the local authority <e> <s> so that i give no hostage to fortune for what i may say this week or further in the future let me say that there are of course situations where there is something different but frankly we do not think that this is one of those situations and therefore we resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> the answer to that is yes indeed they can <e>", "<cs> i have to suggest that it really is unnecessary to write this into the statute <e> <s> the secretary of state has already made it quite clear that there will be full consultations with all interested bodies including the local authority associations before any regulations are made and i am happy to reaffirm that today <e> <s> indeed can noble lords recall any occasion on which regulations of this kind have been made without such consultations <e>", "<cs> i am not aware that i am not reasonable but there may be other opinions as to that <e> <s> i thought the point i made about the other bodies concerned was a very relevant one which was not touched on in what the noble lord lord underhill said <e> <s> there are others too who will have to be consulted on a whole variety of things from time to time and if one were to write it into the statute <e>", "<cs> i cannot comment on the circumstances to which the noble lord refersbut i feel confident in standing on the generality of the point that i made that in fact it has not been the general practice for administrations in the past to write into legislation that there shall be consultation of this kind <e> <s> i think it is right to say that <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been the practice in the past that that is so but my information is that the russians were approached but showed no interest in staging these games on this occasion <e> <s> whether they will be participating i am not sure but my information at present is that they will not be participating <e>", "<cs> my lords may i quickly say commenting on what the noble lord lord donaldson has just said that if his criterion of what local authorities were doing in relation to nursery education is based upon the figures of spending then i am quite sure he is right as regards what the labour authorities were doing <e> <s> if however the assessment the measurement were to be in terms of provisional achievement i suggest that the picture might be rather different <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the comments by the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill <e> <s> yet at the same time there clearly is some uncertainty here <e> <s> it might be wise on this occasion to consider the matter between now and report <e> <s> that we undertake to do <e>", "<cs> in contrast to some other clauses in this bill it is clear even <e>", "<cs> as we are to have a look then of course we will certainly take cognisance of the point made by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to leave on the statute book the power first provided by the act for the secretary of state to make regulations requiring that leas exercise their powers under section <e>", "<cs> as regards the observations of the noble lord lord stewart in another place at another incarnation i might have put it a different way but here i will not do so <e> <s> i need not make any comment on it <e> <s> it does not merit any comment <e> <s> the fact is that the act was a nasty little piece of legislation which when brought to light highlighted as we are doing today only shows that it is very necessary that we do something to get rid of it <e> <s> that is precisely what we are doing <e>", "<cs> referring first of all to amendment there is not a great deal to say on this <e> <s> it is as the noble lord lord mishcon said a modest measure in line with the governments general philosophy of giving local education authorities greater discretion to run their own affairs and to remove or relax unnecessary controls by central government <e> <s> it will enable an authority to take its own decisions about what pe clothing to provide for pupils at schools maintained by it and the conditions under which the clothing will be provided <e> <s> one could talk at greater length on it and if pressed no doubt i will but i fear this is one of those narrow areas where there is not a lot either way <e> <s> we are so anxious as we have tried to stress all through so many of the clauses in this bill to give the local education authorities that much greater <e>", "<cs> i will try to answer in a little more detail the points which the noble lord lord mischon makes <e> <s> the purpose of subsection of clause is explained in the booklet notes on clauses on page <e> <s> to summarise subsection of the education miscellaneous provisions act empowers a secretary of state to make regulations authorising a local education authority to provide clothing for physical training as specified in the regulations for school pupils and further education students <e> <s> the current regulations the provision of clothing regulation authorise the provision of sports footwear shorts jerseys and the like but the regulations only allow these items to be provided on loan <e>", "<cs> i will make just one further comment namely that the regulations made under the act empower the local education authority to recover only such payment as the authority thinks the parent could pay without financial hardship and i would have thought that really was sufficient to satisfy the noble lord <e>", "<cs> an amendment on the same lines and with obviously the same intention of preventing the secretary of state from making regulations relating to the predetermined afe pool until he has consulted an oakes type national body was debated very fully in another place <e> <s> it was made clear then when the government came into office that with the general agreement of the local authorities a stop had to be put on the completely open-ended nature of the pool for advanced further education <e> <s> the noble baroness lady david herself drew attention during the second reading of the bill in this house to the need for this although i accept that she raised it in a slightly different context when she quoted from the speech on th february to the association of principals of colleges of the parliamentary secretary to the des <e> <s> he said the committee will recall <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i was about to comment on his observations in respect of there needing to be or needing not to be cuts in the totality of what is being given to the polytechnics or to advanced further education in this way <e> <s> in effect it is the same as saying that there ought or ought not to be a limit but i shall concede not in the way that i put it previously <e>", "<cs> i think that i fully understand that point and i wish to deal with it when answering some of the points that were made by the noble lord <e> <s> he quoted the instance of newcastle polytechnic which i think he said had the problem of how to cut down its expenditure of million for the coming year <e> <s> he said there is no way they can reduce expenditure on salaries he then went on to talk about not filling posts <e> <s> however that is exactly what we can do and what we must do when the circumstances make it obligatory that we do so <e>", "<cs> i agree that we are very close on that matter as the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead has suggested <e> <s> i thought i said and i shall repeat what i thought i saidnamely that i should emphasise that my colleagues
