["<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble baroness lady stedman and the noble viscount lord simon for their very kind remarks to me <e> <s> i must confess that had the choice been mine i might well have chosen as my opening foray in this house a topic with which i had marginally greater familiarity than either london transport in general or the underground in particular <e> <s> however the fates have decreed otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords we accept that some parts of the british rail service may be affected but in general we are encouraged by the fact that the rail unions did not specifically say or at least as yet have not specifically said that it is their intention to do anything to exacerbate the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the government will be very glad to take note of the points made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords a request as such has not been made but discussions are taking place at the present time as to the commissions proposals for aiding transport infrastructure investment but i understand that is still in the initial stages <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment the government are looking into the present scheme that has been put forward <e> <s> they are not looking into the matter of a channel bridge and i should imagine that that would be done only if the present scheme were found to he not viable and if there were sufficient interest in a bridge as such being constructed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that that was a matter which the noble lord might have taken up with the previous administration who were in office for a number of years and who presumably did not take further the matter as it then was <e>", "<cs> my lords at present the french governments attitude is illustrated by the fact that the sncf has joined with the british railways board in carrying out studies and i understand that the french government have given their blessing to the sncfs continued involvement in the studies <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not know the extent of the previous discussions but it is interesting to note that the present proposals are to be discussed and taken forward in the way that is now being proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that observation <e> <s> i am quite sure that it is that consideration which has encouraged the institution of the studies that are taking place at present <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope to introduce the housing bill in the autumn <e>", "<cs> my lords the government attach great importance to the private rented sector which must be preserved <e> <s> there are great numbers of people particularly the young the single and the mobile who do not want to be or whose circumstances do not permit them to be owner-occupiers or council tenants <e> <s> housing provision for them must come from other sources <e> <s> housing associations can make a valuable contribution but cannot possibly fill the gap that would ensue if all private renting were to end <e> <s> this is quite apart from the socially divisive effect of reducing the choice of tenure only to owner-occupation and council tenancy <e> <s> that is why we are bringing forward proposals to preserve and to revive private renting and to the extent that looking at the rent acts is a part of that we will certainly be doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords the rent acts make it quite clear that in fact the scarcity aspect should not be taken into account when assessing the levels of rents so there is very little that the government can do about that even if it were desirable to do so <e> <s> as regards the noble lords question i have read with much interest his earlier questions on the same subject over the past months or so <e> <s> from the extensive nature of those questions and indeed from the equally extensive replies that he has been given i doubt that i could add anything to what must by now be the noble lords already extensive knowledge of this most complex subject <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the regulations regarding eviction are now under the acts such that there is the same security as has existed ever since the rent acts came into force <e> <s> the noble lord will probably know that in fact the first of these acts was dated and that was followed by the act and a series of acts thereafter <e> <s> the answer to the noble lords question is yes that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords this raises a very complex area <e> <s> there can be few areas that are more complex than the rent acts and their workings <e> <s> it would not be for me to say at this moment in time that the government will seek yet another review of such acts <e> <s> one must of course sympathise with the point the noble lord makes but there is no evidence as such to show that with the rent allowances and the other protection which is available tenants are being evicted as the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the aside which would seem to indicate that there is such a right <e> <s> whether or not legal aid would be available in those circumstances is something i should certainly want to look into <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the noble lord raised the point with the previous administration during the last five years no doubt at regular intervals <e> <s> i can do no better than make <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that fact and as has previously been declared that is precisely why it is the governments intention to introduce a form of shorthold lettings <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed and that is precisely why a study is taking place at present and why we await the results of that study with such interest <e>", "<cs> my lords if a quango was set up and if a quango it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can best answer by saying that this government in the same way as did the previous government are encouraging the keep britain tidy campaign by making what might be considered a rather substantial contribution to the funds for doing that <e> <s> indeed one hopes that we shall continue not only to give such support but to see that it is extended all the way round because the problem is indeed one that ought to receive much consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the distribution favouring rural at the expense of urban areas there is no bias towards rural areas <e> <s> most of the rural areas like most of the urban ones are among the majority of authorities that will see a reduction being made in their gas rateable values <e> <s> the redistribution is proposed simply to take account of where the gas corporations investment is increasing and where it is declining <e> <s> this is a notoriously difficult matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be delighted to write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady stedman cast doubt on the practicability of the timetable in the draft regulations <e> <s> there is in fact no precise information about the number of vehicles that will have to be fitted and we do not know for example how many already have tachographs <e> <s> but the estimates are as realistic as they can be and in making them we have tried to err on the high side <e> <s> whether or not the regulations that i am bringing forward today are premature must be a matter of opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to assure the noble lord that i shall ensure that he receives a reply <e> <s> beyond that there is not much more that i can add <e>", "<cs> my lords the regulations call for precisely that for reciprocal arrangements <e> <s> but the housing circumstances vary in the different countries <e> <s> for example we have a preponderance of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that my noble friend feels that the answer is less than he would like to have <e> <s> it is certainly the one that i am entitled to give in the light of the facts as they are <e> <s> as to whether or not there is the same degree of attention given to this problem in other countries one would only have to go by the history and the record as we have it and if my noble friend will produce some situations to indicate that there have been circumstances where this has not been so i will gladly welcome them and undertake to look at them but at the present time so far as i am aware there are no such instances <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the situation as it has so far obtained as regards numbers and so on there is little likelihood of that happening <e>", "<cs> i think not my lords <e> <s> the record so far shows that the number of occasions when this has arisen is so small that the likelihood is exactly as i have suggested <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not saying that at all <e> <s> what i am saying is that there are regulations which call for total reciprocity in the way this is carried out <e> <s> that is all i am saying <e> <s> i can only repeat what i said a few moments ago that so far there is nothing to indicate that there is such a preponderance or an imbalance as to reflect adversely upon our nationals <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the noble lord will give me some evidence that i can investigate <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i will certainly look at that to see whether there is something which both can and which needs to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i gladly confirm that in fact the government are at this time reviewing the detailed operation of the act <e> <s> we have already accumulated much response to the inquiries that we have made and perhaps before long we might be able to announce the result of such a review <e> <s> but in the meantime if it helps the house i gladly confirm that authorities are required to secure accommodation only for those who are unintentionally homeless and also in priority need <e> <s> it is not always understood that the generality of single people and childless couples would not be assessed as in priority need and would therefore have no opportunity to exploit the act <e> <s> people who are in priority need but who are judged to be intentionally homeless are entitled only to advice and short-term accommodation while they make other arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not have thought that to wish to inquire into the working of the act was to run any sort of hare <e> <s> however i certainly think that the fact that the government are undertaking the review themselves is an indication of a wish to see just how it is working and i would suggest that no one can really complain about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i would readily concur that there is a great deal of misunderstanding about the requirements of the act <e> <s> it is also fair to say that there is some misunderstanding as to the extent of its exploitation <e> <s> therefore would it not be better to await the review because that will bring out the exact extent of any exploitation that there may or may not be <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think that there is some confusion <e> <s> but one needs to recognise the difference between the two acts to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> in the one case it covers a situation where people are intentionally homeless and that is quite different from the situation which arises as regards children who clearly cannot be intentionally homeless <e> <s> so there is a difference and yet it would seem by the very fact that questions are being asked in the way that they are here now that there is need for greater clarification <e> <s> i gladly confirm that one way or another one should undertake to carry that out <e>", "<cs> my lords of course this arises regularly every time anyone mentions housing <e> <s> as to that i would only say that the situation as stated by the noble lord is not correct <e> <s> indeed one makes a house neither more nor less available because the person who then occupies it does so as an owner rather than as a tenant <e> <s> it makes not the slightest difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that if last april anyone had told me that within nine months i should be on my feet in the house of lords winding up a debate for the government on the seventh report of the royal commission on environmental pollution dealing with agriculture and pollution i should have been rather sceptical <e> <s> still fate works in strange ways <e> <s> may i say to the noble baroness lady white who was concerned at the possibility that the report would not be any more implemented than have some others to which she referred that all reports are not always implemented but i hope that what i may have to say will at least give her some encouragement about this one <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that for the moment we really must wait to see the results of the efforts to have the games removed from moscow <e> <s> we entirely recognise that athletes who have trained so hard for so many years should have a chance to compete for medals but in view of world events not now in moscow <e> <s> if the ioc refuses to relocate we shall then have to consider the options open to us but i think that to try to anticipate events now would be unsatis <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i must revert to the earlier point i made that it is a question of timing <e> <s> i think that one should wait <e> <s> there is indeed an indication that there is growing concern around the world about this whole matter and i think it might be prudent to wait until we have the result that we are now seeking from the olympic international committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for the point which she makes but i really think i have to say again that that and indeed all aspects of it should await the outcome of the representations which have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords it may well be that events would show that to be the case but it might also be considered that if the countries who expressed their condemnation at the united nations really wanted to put themselves to the point where there could be relocation then difficult it may be even unsatisfactory in many ways it may be but impossible i would suggest it is not <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the several supplementary questions which my noble friend posed is yes the minister is very much aware <e> <s> i should have thought that perhaps better than most my noble friend would agree that it is as well to take one hurdle at a time <e> <s> while we have entire sympathy with all the points which my noble friend has made i think that we must recognise like it or not that the afghanistan invasion and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the government take advice from all quarters from whatever surprising direction it may come <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat what i said earlier that the wisest thing would be to wait to see what happens <e> <s> the government are close to this and are watching carefully <e> <s> we should wait to see what occurs <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point of view <e> <s> no one should belittle all the problems and difficulties surrounding this sensitive matter <e> <s> i merely repeat that the wisest thing is to wait and see what happens to the representations we have made <e>", "<cs> my lords again i repeat my original point which i think wisest in all the circumstances <e> <s> possibly the more that one says at this moment the more one would exacerbate the situation which is very sensitive <e> <s> we might well wait on events and be assured that the government are watching closely <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had made that point myself but i am grateful to my noble friend for confirming it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i would not be expected to acquiesce in that but i am also sure that her majestys government will have taken note of the concern expressed and that through the usual channels no doubt that will be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving me the opportunity to clarify this rather important point <e> <s> it should be stressed that the building regulations set only minimum standards <e> <s> it is entirely open to people to adopt a higher standard if they wish <e> <s> of course my right honourable friend recognises that energy conservation is essential and he would like to see this wherever appropriate <e> <s> at the same time while we are vigorously <e>", "<cs> my lords only time will tell <e> <s> the fact that there are to be higher minimum standards will have a general upgrading effect <e> <s> it has always been so has it not <e> <s> that if you start with required lower standards the degree above that tends to be lower than where the obligatory standards are higher and i think it is reasonable to expect that <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why i said that the whole area is being looked at at the present time <e> <s> we shall have to wait and see what is the outcome of the review <e> <s> one can either accept that what the noble lord said is correct or not <e> <s> it is a matter of opinion <e> <s> it does not always necessarily follow that local authorities build down to what the noble lord referred to as the lowest standard <e> <s> certainly that is not my experience <e>", "<cs> my lords it was clearly stated that my right honourable friend the secretary of state wanted to have replies to his consultation request by now but there is no doubt that if anybody wishes to make any further observations at this time he will certainly be considered just the same <e> <s> so i think that there is still opportunity if anybody would like to say anything further about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the very fact that my right honourable friend the secretary of state has initiated the particular investigation into this whole matter would have indicated quite the contrary to what the noble lord suggests and indeed i can assure him if assurance he requires that it is the intention to have this information so that one can look at ways of doing things better <e> <s> i should have thought that that was what the government ought to be concentrating on now as much as upon many other things they are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords it is rather like something that is temporary how temporary is temporary and how standard is standard <e> <s> i suppose it is all a question of whether one is buying or selling but i think the noble viscount may be assured that the government are interested that there should be higher standards so far as energy conservation is <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we asked for all the observations to be in by now and in the main if it is of any interest to your lordships some observations have been made <e> <s> they are now being sifted carefully and although i cannot say just which day or what time it is a matter of some urgency <e> <s> we want to see things done better and we shall certainly push on with it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is in fact incorrect to say that pensions are not now linked to the rate of inflation <e> <s> as far as the question of rents is concerned the statutory basis for the assessment of fair rent requires rent officers and rent assessment committees to fix a rent which does not reflect the effects of market scarcity as has been said in your <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to know quite which question of the many that the noble lord has asked to answer first <e> <s> of course he is going right across the whole spectrum of the problem of rented accommodation <e> <s> with great respect as regards scarcity it seems a little far-fetched to argue that the way to persuade more landlords to let accommodation thus relieving scarcity is to reduce their rental income <e> <s> it is a matter of finding a balance between ensuring that there is not only the security of tenure but the rights to pay a fair rent on the one hand and ensuring that landlords can in fact receive at least sufficient to encourage them to rent <e> <s> that is the dilemma that exists <e> <s> however i think that one can only say that the rent acts as they have been and as they are now continue to give and the government are anxious to ensure that they continue to give a fair return by way of the fair <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord suggests yet another review of the rent acts <e> <s> that may well be a course to take but it is a matter which has frequently been reviewed over the last few years and each time the conclusions on scarcity reached by both major political parties have been exactly the same <e> <s> as i said before it is a dilemma <e> <s> how do we achieve an exact balance between the fact that landlords must have a return otherwise the property disappears and give proper rights to tenants to pay a fair rent <e> <s> at the moment we have this system and that is how things will be unless there is a review <e> <s> so far as i am aware my right honourable friend the secretary of state has no intention to suggest that such a review be undertaken at present <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that must be yes but by itself it does not get away from the other point i made which is that it must be in the context of a total situation <e>", "<cs> that my lords is quite a contributory factor and that is why in the bill now in another place there is the intention to introduce short-hold lettings <e> <s> hopefully that will help the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are by no means satisfied although a start does seem to have been made in achieving a reduction in manpower levels <e> <s> but i think it is necessary to keep in proper context the extent of the cuts to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> they are if i may remind the house per cent <e> <s> from the levels of current spending in the current year plus another per cent <e> <s> to be taking place next year <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course quite fallacious to assume that the quality of provision of services is in any way commensurate with the level of expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i was trying to make was that there is not of necessity a relationship between the two points that the noble baroness mentioned <e> <s> in any case the figures that i quoted would surely indicate that at the time they were taken and they are the latest ones available one really could not draw any conclusions at all from them except that there is a trend <e> <s> when we have the next figures which should be i am told early next month we may have a much better indication of the direction in which they are going <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords that certainly is the case but then i think one would have to accept that the circumstances differ in different authorities as indeed does the degree of zealousness with which the various authorities try to carry out the governments requirements <e> <s> the fact is that if we do not succeed in reducing the general level of public expenditure then the debate as to the level of services could in time become somewhat academic <e>", "<cs> as i said my lords the figures i quoted really show nothing of a trend other than that there is in general a slight decrease <e> <s> one might expect the figures next time round to show a greater decrease <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will know that a statistic of that kind is not something i can readily trot out now <e>", "<cs> my lords first to deal with the points raised by the noble baroness lady birk she referred to the cut in fact being a larger one than the figures i quoted using a basis different from the likely out-turn <e> <s> if i were to quote exactly the same figures using the out-turn figures on the basis as did the previous administration it is perhaps interesting to note that we should then have been talking about a reduction from billion in to billion in <e> <s> in other words the previous government in fact halved over four years the actual total housing capital allocation <e> <s> it was an annual average reduction of million <e> <s> i think that helps to put things slightly into perspective <e> <s> if one wanted to make the case even stronger one would have to quote the fact that in the year the reduction was million <e> <s> so let us by all means be concerned at what i said but at the same time let us keep it in perspective <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i suggest that the question is slightly academic because under the bill being brought forward parker-morris as such will no longer be a requisite upon local authorities it will not be required <e> <s> clearly i have not a calculation at the moment as to what it might be if it were to go on in that way but perhaps again i could come back to the noble lord on that later <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will forgive me if i am not absolutely clear as to what answer he wants from me on the particular points he has made <e> <s> perhaps i could say that as regards the housing situation in london i should have thought that the proposals we are making in the bill as regards shorthold might very well and hopefully will have a significant impact on the availability of accommodation in the private rented sector <e> <s> within the inner london area that i would think would be a major contribution if it turns out as we expect <e>", "<cs> my lords there will he separate statements written statements in both houses on the position in scotland and in wales <e> <s> so hopefully the information noble lords require will be available either now or very soon <e> <s> perhaps i may make one last comment on the point that the noble lord lord ross made as regards the position in scotland <e> <s> as it happens i do know a little of the position in scotland from another incarnation and so on <e> <s> yes i am inclined to agree with him that in some parts of scotland the housing position is indeed very bad and requires a great deal of work and help <e> <s> i cannot tell him what the statement is as regards scotland because i do not have it with me <e> <s> however on one point i would have to differ with him <e> <s> i do not accept that when you sell a council house you take it out of the stock <e> <s> i have said this before and doubtless will say it again when we come to the housing bill <e> <s> the person who occupies a house as a tenant and then buys it thereby becoming the owner continues to occupy the same house <e> <s> he makes it neither more nor less available than before because he continues to occupy it in exactly the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i answered not long ago on this same point i would refer my noble friend to the short-hold proposals in the forthcoming bill which we shall be seeing fairly soon <e> <s> again only time will tell but i at least hope that this will be a major contribution towards making landlords feel that there is greater security for them in renting <e> <s> there is no doubt that the successive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble baroness feels that my answer did not make sense to her <e> <s> the fact is that i can only repeat what i said previously <e> <s> there has been far too great a willingness to make such forecasts in the past which have invariably been proven wrong not least in the last year when local authorities alone had an underspend of some per cent <e> <s> on their proposals <e> <s> clearly it would not help at all to make such guesses <e> <s> however in any case the one-block position makes all the difference every authority will decide for itself what it will do in its own area <e>", "<cs> my lords it has necessitated a careful appraisal of the priorities involving the abandonment of activities of lower or no priority and a reduced input to others <e> <s> but overall it is fair to say that the department is continuing to do its job without adverse effects on its efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords whether it is instructive or not is not for me to say <e> <s> a question was put to me and i have answered it <e> <s> as the noble lord asked further questions i will be glad to send him a written answer with the same details in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been no compulsory redundancy <e> <s> the target as was stated in the statement by the lord president on th december is for the department to save posts which would represent a saving in money of some million i estimate that the saving so far has been some million a year <e>", "<cs> my lords the term which is used one which i do not particularly like is natural wastage <e> <s> it refers to people who have retired have passed away have become ill or have found other employment people who for one reason or another of their own volition have left the department <e>", "<cs> my lords what they have done after they have left the department i really cannot answer <e> <s> but none of them has been made compulsorily redundant <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness lady phillips for her support <e> <s> it is from a most unexpected direction if i may say so but none the less very much welcome <e> <s> i must say that she put it so well <e> <s> it was exactly what i was trying to say but did not put quite so well <e> <s> but speaking from my own experience i never felt in any way second-class or whatever <e> <s> nor did the foundation governors in my experience ever try in any way to make us feel like that <e> <s> it may be i was very fortunate and of course coming from leeds i would not expect it to be otherwise <e> <s> but i must say that that is my experience <e> <s> the point that the noble lord <e> <s> lord parry made was very interesting but it does not get us away from the fact that there is still a basic statutory requirement on foundation governors and therefore there they are <e> <s> i still say again that i fear we cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord brooks of tremorfa i too was put on to the education committee in my first year in local government and like him i too eventually became the leader of my authority <e> <s> so it would seem that a basic prerequisite for potential leaders is to go on to the education committee in their first year <e>", "<cs> yes i entirely accept that but in practice it is surprising how local education authorities do in fact appoint so many of their members to so many governing bodies <e> <s> if the noble baroness lady david is making the point that they should not and that they ought to bring in more from other sources one can only agree with her <e>", "<cs> on the latter point it is not all local education authorities who treat service on the governing body as a designated duty for the purpose of attendance allowances <e> <s> but i do know as the noble lord says that there are some who do <e> <s> however it does really not change anything <e> <s> i hope that in the light of what has been said the noble lord lord brooks of tremorfa will be able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> in fact i thought this was a rather surprising amendment <e> <s> first it is in direct conflict with an amendment tabled by the labour opposition in committee in another place which sought to restrict local education authority appointees to no more than half the number of the governors <e> <s> secondly it would in spirit run directly counter to the kind of experimentation in the composition of governing bodies which we are already seeing in birmingham and other places and which until now i had thought was welcomed by all parties <e> <s> thirdly it would in practice be unworkable because it would not be possible in the case of a voluntary aided school to fulfil both the requirements of the amendment and the requirement in subsection that there should be a majority of foundation governors <e>", "<cs> i understand the noble lords intentions in seeking to establish through the governing body a link between schools and the areas from which the children who attend them come although i am bound to say that the force of this amendment contrasts very strongly with that of amendment no <e> <s> which is down in the names of noble lords opposite <e> <s> however i think that it would be wrong in principle to give one local education authority a statutory voice in the way another local education authority carried out its statutory responsibilities each lea must be responsible for its own schools <e> <s> the formulation proposed by the noble lords in their amendment is in any event unsatisfactory as the numbers attending a school from a neighbouring authority could vary on either side of per cent <e> <s> or any other figure for that matter from year to year leading to continual upheaval in the governing body of the school <e> <s> i too do not have a great deal to say on this amendment but i am sure that this is something we can and <e>", "<cs> i hardly think that the proposal would to quote the noble lord lord davies of leek <e>", "<cs> as for the sentiments there is no difference at all between us <e> <s> indeed during the debate in committee in another place my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state made it clear that we wholly agree with the sentiment behind the amendment <e> <s> however in the bill before this house we are seeking to leave the maximum flexibility in the hands of local education authorities <e> <s> i have no doubt that the right of appointment should rest with them and i think we can safely leave it to authorities in making appointments under either subsection or subsection of <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can let that go out <e> <s> the fact is that it all boils down to yes there is the agreement of everyone that the sentiments behind this amendment are what we want to see happen <e> <s> we are disagreeing on how it should happen and what effect the amendment might have to ensure that it did happen <e> <s> that is the issue <e> <s> one may always be able to pick out the odd situation where it would not be so but in the main the government are very anxious to leave it to the good sense and responsibility of the local authority <e> <s> we must stand on that in regard to this amendment <e>", "<cs> the taylor report recommended that the right of minor authorities to representation on the governing bodies of primary schools in their area should be discontinued <e> <s> however this was in the context of their more general recommendations concerning the composition of governing bodies and they went on to reaffirm the value of members drawn from such authorities <e> <s> reactions to the taylor report showed that the links between primary schools and their communities are often much valued and the last governments bill recognised this by retaining a right of appointment for minor authorities <e> <s> our approach to the composition of governing bodies differs markedly both from that recommended by taylor and from that of the last government but we share that governments views concerning the value of minor authority involvement in primary school governing bodies <e> <s> it is for this reason that we have continued their existing right of representation although in a form more in keeping <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first in order to help the noble lord lord leatherland give in detail the definition of a minor authority <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> the district council is not necessarily excluded <e> <s> it is prescriptive in this sense <e> <s> it is a question of the definition and in what circumstances it would fill the role of a minor authority <e> <s> i thought that the definition that i read out made the point of the circumstances in which it would do so but by itself this amendment and this part of the bill is referring to the minor authority as such <e> <s> i respectfully submit that that is what we must content ourselves with at this moment <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to ensure that the local education authority responsible for the maintenance of a controlled school shall always have a stronger voice on the governing body of that school than the foundation governors <e> <s> i think it is unnecessary however because the making of instruments for voluntary schools is a matter for the secretary of state who by virtue of section of the act must consult with the local <e>", "<cs> i should first explain that the amendment is defective as there is no provision in subsections or for the local education authority to make any appointments <e> <s> it is under subsection that a local education authority will make its appointments to the governing bodies of all maintained schools <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might deal with the points raised more or less in the sequence in which they were raised <e> <s> i entirely endorse what the noble lord lord parry said about the respect one would have for the noble lord lord heycock <e> <s> it goes without saying at all <e>", "<cs> perhaps that was slightly out of context <e> <s> i was referring to the matter of freedoms for local government generally <e> <s> i think that was the point i made <e> <s> i was referring to something else <e>", "<cs> i listened with interest to what the noble lord lord brooks said <e> <s> our aim in setting the size of school below which the minimum number of elected teacher governors need only be one rather than two was twofold to allow for the practical difficulties of electing two governors from a very small teaching staff in the smallest schools and to make it possible to keep down the overall size of the governing body in such schools <e> <s> the figure of was chosen not because leas wanted to be able to keep teacher governor numbers down in the larger schools falling below it but to help the voluntary school authorities to keep down the overall size of their governing bodies <e> <s> in their case the addition of a teacher means the addition of another foundation governor as well to keep their majority at the level set out in subsection <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> i should have thought the answer really is twofold <e> <s> first of all there is the point i made about the head teacher and secondly when you start to get to the really small schools you start to talk about grouping <e> <s> i should have thought that that was really the answer to my noble friend lord swinton <e> <s> either way i think the point is still valid either the head teacher or the grouping would be the answer <e>", "<cs> of course one could get grouping where you had a primary school and a smaller school on the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i must repeat that until we know from the outcome of the review the precise extent of the problem as it concerns and affects the two areas in question it would be difficult to say precisely what ought to be done <e> <s> it would be fair to say that the evidence would not seem to be as extensive as might be thought <e> <s> nevertheless to prejudge it and also to prejudge precisely what one would do about it would not be right <e> <s> clearly one must wait to see exactly what it is we are talking about <e> <s> if it should be that the burden is as great as my noble friend intimates and i repeat that we shall know only when we have the results of the review clearly we should want to look at it in the light of that <e>", "<cs> my lords what can we do but wait and see when we do not have the facts in front of us to indicate the extent of what we are talking about <e> <s> if it should prove to be as some would suggest quite minimal the burden on the ratepayers would not be as my noble friend suggests <e> <s> however if it is a burden of significance clearly the government would want to take that into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i should say at once that i did not in fact say that there was not a great burden on hillingdon <e> <s> i said that as yet we did not know quite what it was and that we wanted to know <e> <s> as for the other case to which the noble baroness referred i would point out that the court said that in those circumstances there was a duty to house <e> <s> however i think it would do no harm to make it quite clear that that is not so in every case <e> <s> this was the case of someone who was designated and given the status of a refugee <e> <s> in those circumstances the courts judge that there is a duty <e> <s> however it should also be stated that if it can be shown that the immigrant has not taken reasonable steps in advance to find accommodation there may indeed not be a duty to do other than find some temporary accommodation until such time as the person concerned can reasonably find himself something else <e> <s> therefore the matter is not as clear-cut as it might seem on the face <e>", "<cs> it is really a question of how far the noble baroness and the noble lord lord taylor of blackburn accept that local education authorities are responsible elected representative bodies who do not need their hand held in this way <e> <s> our policy on this side of the committee is to work on the assumption that leas will behave reasonably and to leave as much of the detailed arrangements as is possible in their hands <e> <s> in the case of elections of parent and teacher governors the only and crucial condition it seems necessary to lay down in statute is that elections shall be by secret ballot <e> <s> the matters stipulated in the amendment are only some of those which local education authorities will have responsibility for resolving <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord parry referred to what he called the dilemma facing the government <e> <s> i was not aware that the government were facing a dilemma on this issue least of all on this amendmentwe may face dilemmas on some others but certainly not on this one <e> <s> he also said that local government was moving away from the people <e> <s> i suppose that is a view but i think everyone in the committee is concerned to ensure that that should not be so and i do not think there is anything in the bill that will do other if that is the case than bring it closer <e> <s> in any event if anybody has experience of organising and running elections it must be the local authorities <e> <s> they have great experience of this as i know <e> <s> my noble friend lord swinton referred to the question of expense and i am grateful to him for making that point <e> <s> certainly there would be greater expense if we were to follow the lines proposed in the amendment but in all honesty that is not the prime reason for us not waiting to accept it <e> <s> nevertheless my noble friend made an important point <e>", "<cs> i understand the noble baronesss reasons for proposing the amendment even though as drafted it would not achieve the effect that she has in mind <e> <s> i certainly agree that the most obvious case in which it would be sensible to group two primary schools is where a junior and infants school share the same site <e> <s> but there may be other circumstances where local authorities would wish to do this and yet again it seems to the government sensible to leave this to the discretion of the local education authorities for local determination in the light of local circumstances <e>", "<cs> when anyone says to me even in leeds i usually respond by saying especially in leeds <e> <s> but on this occasion i think i must say again that the thrust of this point so far as the government are concerned is that i am fairly sure that local education authorities would resent this removal of a discretion that they have at present in this matter <e> <s> it really comes down to a point that we debated again and again yesterday and which no doubt we shall debate yet again and again before the week is out <e> <s> it is a question of how far one is willing to leave the matter to the discretion of the local authority <e> <s> so that i give no hostage to fortune for what i may say this week or further in the future let me say that there are of course situations where there is something different but frankly we do not think that this is one of those situations and therefore we resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> the answer to that is yes indeed they can <e>", "<cs> i have to suggest that it really is unnecessary to write this into the statute <e> <s> the secretary of state has already made it quite clear that there will be full consultations with all interested bodies including the local authority associations before any regulations are made and i am happy to reaffirm that today <e> <s> indeed can noble lords recall any occasion on which regulations of this kind have been made without such consultations <e>", "<cs> i am not aware that i am not reasonable but there may be other opinions as to that <e> <s> i thought the point i made about the other bodies concerned was a very relevant one which was not touched on in what the noble lord lord underhill said <e> <s> there are others too who will have to be consulted on a whole variety of things from time to time and if one were to write it into the statute <e>", "<cs> i cannot comment on the circumstances to which the noble lord refersbut i feel confident in standing on the generality of the point that i made that in fact it has not been the general practice for administrations in the past to write into legislation that there shall be consultation of this kind <e> <s> i think it is right to say that <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been the practice in the past that that is so but my information is that the russians were approached but showed no interest in staging these games on this occasion <e> <s> whether they will be participating i am not sure but my information at present is that they will not be participating <e>", "<cs> my lords may i quickly say commenting on what the noble lord lord donaldson has just said that if his criterion of what local authorities were doing in relation to nursery education is based upon the figures of spending then i am quite sure he is right as regards what the labour authorities were doing <e> <s> if however the assessment the measurement were to be in terms of provisional achievement i suggest that the picture might be rather different <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the comments by the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill <e> <s> yet at the same time there clearly is some uncertainty here <e> <s> it might be wise on this occasion to consider the matter between now and report <e> <s> that we undertake to do <e>", "<cs> in contrast to some other clauses in this bill it is clear even <e>", "<cs> as we are to have a look then of course we will certainly take cognisance of the point made by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to leave on the statute book the power first provided by the act for the secretary of state to make regulations requiring that leas exercise their powers under section <e>", "<cs> as regards the observations of the noble lord lord stewart in another place at another incarnation i might have put it a different way but here i will not do so <e> <s> i need not make any comment on it <e> <s> it does not merit any comment <e> <s> the fact is that the act was a nasty little piece of legislation which when brought to light highlighted as we are doing today only shows that it is very necessary that we do something to get rid of it <e> <s> that is precisely what we are doing <e>", "<cs> referring first of all to amendment there is not a great deal to say on this <e> <s> it is as the noble lord lord mishcon said a modest measure in line with the governments general philosophy of giving local education authorities greater discretion to run their own affairs and to remove or relax unnecessary controls by central government <e> <s> it will enable an authority to take its own decisions about what pe clothing to provide for pupils at schools maintained by it and the conditions under which the clothing will be provided <e> <s> one could talk at greater length on it and if pressed no doubt i will but i fear this is one of those narrow areas where there is not a lot either way <e> <s> we are so anxious as we have tried to stress all through so many of the clauses in this bill to give the local education authorities that much greater <e>", "<cs> i will try to answer in a little more detail the points which the noble lord lord mischon makes <e> <s> the purpose of subsection of clause is explained in the booklet notes on clauses on page <e> <s> to summarise subsection of the education miscellaneous provisions act empowers a secretary of state to make regulations authorising a local education authority to provide clothing for physical training as specified in the regulations for school pupils and further education students <e> <s> the current regulations the provision of clothing regulation authorise the provision of sports footwear shorts jerseys and the like but the regulations only allow these items to be provided on loan <e>", "<cs> i will make just one further comment namely that the regulations made under the act empower the local education authority to recover only such payment as the authority thinks the parent could pay without financial hardship and i would have thought that really was sufficient to satisfy the noble lord <e>", "<cs> an amendment on the same lines and with obviously the same intention of preventing the secretary of state from making regulations relating to the predetermined afe pool until he has consulted an oakes type national body was debated very fully in another place <e> <s> it was made clear then when the government came into office that with the general agreement of the local authorities a stop had to be put on the completely open-ended nature of the pool for advanced further education <e> <s> the noble baroness lady david herself drew attention during the second reading of the bill in this house to the need for this although i accept that she raised it in a slightly different context when she quoted from the speech on th february to the association of principals of colleges of the parliamentary secretary to the des <e> <s> he said the committee will recall <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i was about to comment on his observations in respect of there needing to be or needing not to be cuts in the totality of what is being given to the polytechnics or to advanced further education in this way <e> <s> in effect it is the same as saying that there ought or ought not to be a limit but i shall concede not in the way that i put it previously <e>", "<cs> i think that i fully understand that point and i wish to deal with it when answering some of the points that were made by the noble lord <e> <s> he quoted the instance of newcastle polytechnic which i think he said had the problem of how to cut down its expenditure of million for the coming year <e> <s> he said there is no way they can reduce expenditure on salaries he then went on to talk about not filling posts <e> <s> however that is exactly what we can do and what we must do when the circumstances make it obligatory that we do so <e>", "<cs> i agree that we are very close on that matter as the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead has suggested <e> <s> i thought i said and i shall repeat what i thought i saidnamely that i should emphasise that my colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords i gladly give that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord parry i think said that everyone who goes to church is not necessarily a devotee <e> <s> may i say that everyone even in her majestys government who speaks on education is not necessarily an expert on the subject <e> <s> an expert maybe not but knowledgeable one would hope at least to some extent <e> <s> the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley raised this point in almost precisely the same way at committee stage and he argued then that the house should agree to this amendment to give local authorities a push in the right direction when deciding whom to appoint to school governing bodies <e> <s> i think everyone would share his intentions in our common wish to see appointed people who are concerned and who take a real interest in the affairs of the school <e> <s> but as we have previously pointed out and as the noble lord lord robbins and my noble friend lady macleod of borve so rightly said if we apply those criteria then we must apply others as well and a whole list could be drawn up <e> <s> i think at committee stage i referred to some nine or different groups which one might say might be represented higher and further education industry commerce agriculture community relations non-teaching staff pupils trade unions employers universities <e> <s> really the list is almost endless and where would one start and where finish <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i should like just to say that the sentiments expressed by my noble friend lord derwent in my opinion were fair and proper and apposite <e> <s> of course one would agree with the philosophy behind the amendment and would surely expect and hope that those who make such appointments would do so in the knowledge of all the qualities that the particular schools in question needed to have in their governors <e> <s> in my own experience this has always been so <e> <s> there really is no reason to suspect that it would not continue to be so and in those circumstances the government would have to ask the noble lord whether he would be prepared to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the last point which the noble baroness lady wootton raises almost makes the case in that when you start to specify in great detail when you start to lay open to analysis some of the categories proposed you bring into question many aspects <e> <s> indeed what was said in the discussion on the previous amendment is also not inapposite <e> <s> the fact is that the more one seeks to lay down and to specify the more difficulties one can run into <e> <s> it seems to me that if we are saying to local education authorities and i think that i am quoting correctly what the noble lord lord stewart of fulham said that they should appoint those who have knowledge of the outside world then that is fine and i am sure that that is right <e> <s> the noble lord hoped that those appointing would appoint people who might not have been thought of <e> <s> hence the need to specify them as in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords by the leave of the house perhaps i could touch on a few of the points that have been made and as usually happens the last ones first <e> <s> the noble lord lord stewart of fulham said that the basis of the amendment is that it calls for a wider view <e> <s> i should have thought that it calls for exactly the opposite a narrower view <e> <s> the wider view is when you seek not to prescribe the more you prescribe the narrower you make the view <e> <s> on the question whether or not an old boy or old girl is better or worse i believe that that will always be a matter of opinion <e> <s> indeed i think that my noble friend lady macleod made the case very well not by seeking to specify that as a category of persons but by the very fact that when one seeks to specify any category of persons one makes the view narrower rather than wider <e>", "<cs> again by leave of the house the point has been made <e> <s> when circulars are issued i would certainly ensure that this is considered by the government <e> <s> clearly the noble viscount would not expect me here and now to give such an undertaking <e> <s> the point is made is taken and will be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady david pressed this amendment to a division when we considered it in committee because she thought that the clause as presently drafted provided a let-out for authorities who wished to <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not the premises are suitable for the purpose specified is for the local authority itself to decide <e> <s> it is for the local authority to decide whether an educational establishment is suitable for education <e> <s> but if at any time there is evidence to suggest that the premises are being used for improper purposes as the noble lord lord chalfont suggests then i would agree with him that then and only then would be the time for any appropriate action <e> <s> beyond that i think that the government at this stage cannot go because it is still very much a matter for the local authority at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering the previous question i did not cover one point which was made by the noble lord lord chalfont <e> <s> he asked whether or not the premises would be given in effect diplomatic status <e> <s> the answer is no they would not <e> <s> we do not regard schools as the premises of a diplomatic mission <e> <s> however turning to the point which was raised by the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts namely whether this was something which should be watched any local authority which grants planning permission or user permission for any purpose presumably always has an obligation to ensure that it is used for that purpose <e> <s> should there be any complaint which would lead to there being evidence to the contrary it would indeed be a matter in the first instance for the authority and if it were another kind of matter it would then be for the government to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know how they define educational purposes in libya but for the purposes of this approval it has to be how we in this country define them <e> <s> one can understand the concern one properly does but one of the penalties which we pay for being the kind of society we are is that in fact we do allow things to be worked equally for whoever is here and so long as they conform then we will always go along with them <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> at the end of the day it was the inner london education authority which sold the school <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in answering the noble lord lord chalfont it would become a national matter if the use were contrary to normal educational standards as we know them <e> <s> then it would be something quite else <e> <s> but for somebody to apply and to be given permission by a local authority to use premises for educational purposes is the way in which our system works and at the moment we have to go along that way <e>", "<cs> my lords my information is that the premises are to be used as a school <e> <s> who is to be taught there and indeed if it comes to that what is <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have to say that the responsibility for keeping an eye on the use must be that of the local authority <e> <s> they are the ones who are giving the permission and presumably they are the ones who have ascertained the validity of the application and theirs is the responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly say that we shall take careful note of the point made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always useful to have statistics but the problem of compiling them in the way that they will be most effective is quite difficult not to say costly <e> <s> that is why we have not seen further such surveys in the last few years <e> <s> as to the steps which the government are taking to see that more unused and underused land is released for development there are a number of such steps including the repeal of the community land act the reduction of the development land tax rate and the raising of the initial threshold <e>", "<cs> my lords it so happens that at the present time we are considering when the next derelict land survey should take place but clearly decisions on such matters have to be taken bearing in mind not least the central and local resources which it would consume <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the letter to which the noble lord refers but i should certainly have thought that anything which encouraged the bringing forth of land for beneficial use rather than that it should lie unused derelict or whatever could be only to the good <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it would very much include that kind of land <e> <s> indeed it should include any land for which there is no foreseeable use <e> <s> that can be only to the good and i am sure that everyone i know endorses the rectitude of that line <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of that <e> <s> whereas at present local authorities are required to acquire derelict land in order to reclaim it with the aid of grant the local government planning and land bill contains a provision clause which will enable grant to be paid in future direct to the private sector and public bodies other than local authorities <e> <s> the grant is to cover net loss only <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking of two separate issues <e> <s> the question relates to derelict land and i have referred to unused and underused land <e> <s> the noble earls question refers to allotment land which itself is the subject of proposals contained in the bill <e> <s> as noble lords may have seen in the last few days there is considerable concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the noble lord <e> <s> that is precisely why one of the provisions contained in the bill is along the lines which i described <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for reminding us of the survey to which he refers of which i do know <e> <s> i shall certainly take away the point he makes about the problems which they seem to be encountering <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i suggest that that is not really related to the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say again that i think that strays a long way from the original question <e> <s> i take the point made but i am not in a position to confirm or otherwise the second part of the noble lords observation <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as requirements under the various tenancy acts not being adhered to if the noble lord has any specific instances i shall be glad to look at them <e> <s> as to the second part of his question as to whether i am aware that whole districts are in danger of being taken over in the way that he suggests i am not sure that that is something that i am aware of most of all to that extent <e> <s> i do not know of that <e> <s> i know of the concern that exists and it is a matter that the government are thinking about but it would be quite wrong of me to try to imply anything further than that at this moment in time <e> <s> i can only say again with some regret that i fear that there is not more that i can say to the noble lord to help him in this matter which he raises regularly and which he is probably quite right so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords to use an expression i have learned since i came to your lordships house and to another place i hear what the noble lord says and certainly will take note of it <e> <s> that does not necessarily mean that that is the end of it but of course this whole area is a very difficult one indeed as i have said before <e> <s> as your lordships will no doubt have seen from a statement made by the minister in another place only in the last week there have been pronouncements as to what might be done to make certain modifications to the leasehold reform act <e> <s> that indicates i am sure that the matter is one which is under consideration all the time <e> <s> if that does not go so far as the noble lord would like me to do i should have to repeat again that it is because it is under review the whole of the time <e>", "<cs> as i have said before my lords this is a matter which is of considerable concern <e> <s> i trust that it was of equal concern prior to months ago when the previous administration had the same problem with which to deal though i do not know that they did anything about it <e> <s> we have said and we say again that we are certainly looking at the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords just on a point of order i do not recall using that term myself <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by saying how very grateful i am to everyone who has spoken for the kind things they have said i of course include lord underhill who did not have the opportunity of saying this <e> <s> when i first arrived in your lordships house everyone told me that this was a place where among other things the standard of debating would be very high and that members were very kind <e> <s> after an initial reservation as to that i am very happy to say that has been proven to me to be absolutely so and if i may say so never more so than today <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i certainly will read the report tomorrow and if part of what i said applies then fair enough <e> <s> we shall call it one each shall we on that point <e> <s> but i submit that a bus service on which every passenger travels at least miles is quite different from the local bus services that we all know and love <e> <s> it will not be possible for an operator to disguise a stage carriage service as an express one <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the best way that i can deal with the point is to write to the noble lord <e> <s> i could give a view now and i think it would be the right one but i feel it might be better if i were to write to the noble lord and i will do it quickly certainly in order to allow the noble lord all the time that he needs for drafting the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i could give a view but i am not sure that that is what in fact i ought to do <e> <s> what i will do however is to think about the point made by the noble lord that is enabling the information to be available on a wider basis <e> <s> i undertake to do that as a matter of some urgency in view of the relative proximity to the committee stage <e> <s> perhaps i may try to deal with it in that way <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords of course that goes without saying <e> <s> i will make a special point of that <e> <s> i think i have just about covered that point and i <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must say that of course there is no intention to mislead the house at this or any other time past or future <e> <s> i think that goes without saying <e> <s> but many things are said which can lead to various assumptions <e> <s> perhaps i may just say this about the actuarial assumptions <e> <s> in the first place it is not true that there would necessarily have been agreement under the act <e> <s> if i may say with equal respect no less the noble lord lord mishcon is not misleading the house <e> <s> i think that is far too strong a way to put it <e> <s> of course we might disagree we might give a wrong view but that is not misleading <e> <s> i think you only mislead if you set out to do so and clearly no one is trying to do that <e> <s> but first there is the formal position <e>", "<cs> well then unhappily if you like while bus use goes on steadily falling and of that there can be no argument <e> <s> their only amelioration would be to pay more in subsidies <e> <s> may i remind the house of these staggering figures it was million in not all that long ago million in <e> <s> i think those are staggering figures and still the service and its use declines <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two major thrusts in the question <e> <s> the first relates to the rateable value limits under the rent acts <e> <s> i am very well aware of the representations that have been made not least by the noble lord on many occasions and by individuals <e> <s> all i can say as to that today is that we are bearing those representations in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had done so <e> <s> i must have put it badly <e> <s> that is precisely what i was trying to say <e> <s> there is no intention at all of trying to remove the scarcity factor from the calculation of rents <e> <s> if i put it the other way round then i am sorry i did not mean to do so <e> <s> i shall read <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that i was treating the matter in a summary fashion at all <e> <s> in fact the number of occasions that i have answered the same point or tried to do i think would indicate that i treat it very far from summarily <e> <s> it is a very important matter and i treat it with the respect and importance which it merits <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that we are getting into very deep water because i had the privilege of sitting on the francis committee where we studied rent regulation and the definitions of scarcity every friday for months <e> <s> we tried to decide what was a proper definition of scarcity in this context <e> <s> i should hate now to embark upon definitions of scarcity for your lordships benefit <e> <s> i do not think you would thank me but i think that the question which the noble lord has raised on several occasions really relates to the earlier point i mentioned concerning the rateable value limits <e> <s> i think that is the way to approach the matter and i did say that we are bearing that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a marathon question and i am not sure that i can cover all the points asked but if the noble lord is saying that people do not know or do not care about the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is rent assessment committees or rent officers who make policy at all <e> <s> they are there to adjudicate upon what should be a fair rent <e> <s> the fact is that the law as it now stands says quite clearly that scarcity should not be taken into account <e> <s> indeed one of the noble lords opposite lord janner regularly exhorts me to do exactly the opposite of what the noble lord lord strabolgi has suggested <e> <s> in any case i do not think i can add much to what i seem to say at regular weekly intervals on this same question <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the point raised by the noble lord lord janner is on a different topic from the one raised by this particular question <e> <s> if we start to talk of these huge increases we find they tend to be in the areas where the rateable values are very high and that is a problem <e> <s> the last time we were bearing this in mind i did say that it was a matter of concern but i could not go further than that last week and i cannot go further than that today <e> <s> other than that i do not think there is evidence in truth to indicate that the act is being operated by the rent assessment committees other than in an impartial way <e> <s> there is surely no basis for saying that <e> <s> if the conclusions that they reach are unhappy for many people that is the basic problem that exists <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords the only thing i can say on the ability of people to meet rents is that this is taken care of in the rent allowances available to those who cannot meet them <e> <s> i think it would be fair to say that the extent of rent allowances is often far more than people realise <e> <s> for instance rent allowances are in certain circumstances available for families who have an income even as high as a year <e> <s> so on that latter point i think the only answer i can give to the noble lord lord shinwell to be helpful is that a closer look at what is available under rent allowances is the best i can advise <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i too do not intend to make any major observations or repeat what was said at the second reading of the bill other than to say that quite clearly as your lordships would expect the government feel that the measures in the bill are indeed an attempt to improve something which clearly needs <e>", "<cs> i must say that this amendment seems to me to be unnecessary <e> <s> the present threshold is seven seats as has been said and we are proposing a modest increase of one seat <e> <s> i see no reason why a relatively small number of owners of very large cars or small minibuses should be excluded from private non-commercial car-sharing simply because they may occasionally wish to give a lift <e> <s> i believe that any fears of a threat to taxis or to public transport are exaggerated <e>", "<cs> i must say that this amendment seems to me to be unnecessary <e> <s> the running costs of the vehicle in this clause means precisely what it says that is the costs attributable to the vehicles only petrol oil insurance and so on and not costs in respect of any labour or profit element <e> <s> if the passengers contributions do not exceed the vehicle costs there will be no element of profit <e> <s> to add on a specific reference to profit is thus an unnecessary complication <e>", "<cs> all i can do to be helpful on this point is to repeat what i said a few moments ago namely i recognise and i think anyone would the problems that exist in trying to define profit and costs <e> <s> therefore i said and i repeat we have not finally closed our minds to a more comprehensive definition of running costs but we recognise in saying that the great difficulties that there are <e> <s> i said and i repeat that we shall take note of what has been said today and consider whether the drafting is entirely adequate <e> <s> beyond that i fear i cannot go <e>", "<cs> may i begin by saying to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that i can assure him and other members of the committee about their concern <e> <s> i will endeavour to do that in a moment <e> <s> may i say that i entirely accept what my noble friend lord lucas said that this is not a matter that should be passed over lightly <e> <s> it is one of considerable importance and arguably one of the most important aspects of this part of the bill <e> <s> my noble friend said very fairly that this amendment is precisely the one that he put down in <e> <s> i suggest that it disregards the most important factor of all namely what has in practice transpired since his amendment was put down two years ago <e> <s> i will come to that in a moment <e> <s> it is a cardinal principle of this government that statutory regulation should be avoided except when it is demonstrably necessary and my noble friend lord lucas has not convinced me that it is necessary here <e> <s> i will endeavour to convince the members of the committee <e> <s> the purpose of the compulsory insurance provisions of the road traffic act is to ensure that funds are available to meet the cost of compensation for damages awarded to an injured third party or in the case of death to his dependants in respect of a common law liability incurred by the user of a motor vehicle <e> <s> this requirement covers passengers and cannot be avoided by whether or not they are contributing towards the cost of their journey <e> <s> passengers are required by the present law to be covered by insurance against personal injury whatever the use of the vehicle or conditions under which they are carried and i state categorically that neither the provisions of the bill nor the proposed amendment would have any effect on these requirements <e>", "<cs> what i said when i touched earlier on the point of profit still stands <e> <s> we cannot ignore what is surely the most significant factor of all to my mind <e> <s> we must look at what has happened and at the experience we have had in the two years since this very same point was made in detail in an amendment in the same wording <e> <s> it was discussed and debated at some length then and obviously at that time it must have given rise to concern <e> <s> what has been the experience <e> <s> what could be better as a guide to us than that <e> <s> the evidence is that we have observations by those very important bodies such as the aa and the rac <e> <s> they have to be people of standing in this whole scene and they have said categorically we are satisfied <e> <s> the motor conference has also said we are satisfied <e> <s> if they all say they are satisfied then while i take the point which the noble lord lord mishcon put forward so ably as always i think that in the context of where we are standing in relation to this amendment we are entitled to say we can be satisfied on this <e> <s> certainly i am <e>", "<cs> may i in turn apologise to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i had not realised that one was quite so quick off the mark or that the extent of the opposition which he was counting was so great as so to delay his return to the committee <e>", "<cs> i will gladly repeat again the numbers of the other amendments which i am including <e> <s> they are amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> if i was unable on the last amendment to persuade the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran of the strength of the case i was arguing i would at least hope to be more successful on this occasion <e> <s> may i therefore begin by picking up the points made by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> the first and i think the most important to make absolutely clear is that the intention of this amendment is not in any way to seek to replace what might be lost by a local <e>", "<cs> among other parts of this definition of a stage carriage service i understand that it covers a -mile area and i would assume that would apply in this case also but if i should have any reason to state otherwise i might at a later date confirm or deny that <e>", "<cs> so far as the scottish side is concerned the scottish education authorities duty to carry pupils is in no way affected by this clause <e> <s> their first <e>", "<cs> i too had gathered that there has been much talk about whether clause a provides a loophole for operators to escape road service licensing for services between places which are in fact less than the specified distance apart by taking a roundabout route <e> <s> the answer surely is that the clause does indeed permit roundabout routes but provided that every passenger goes at least miles in a straight line in the process <e> <s> that really is the basic criterion that is what really matters on this point <e> <s> it is not only the distance between places on which the amendment concentrates but how far each and every passenger must travel <e>", "<cs> i think i can help the noble lord lord underhill and the noble viscount lord simon <e> <s> the amendment is not necessary because the bill already provides what is sought <e> <s> the definition of an express service works by stipulating two conditions both of which must be satisfied for a service to be classified as express <e> <s> the first condition the mile rule we have already discussed <e> <s> the second condition that of notifying the traffic commissioners is what concerns noble lords opposite <e> <s> i can reassure them that satisfying the notification requirements is as much a part of the basic definition of an express service as the mile rule <e> <s> if the service has not been notified it is not an express service <e> <s> if it is a service at separate fares then it will be a local service requiring a road service licence and the sanction in clause will bite <e> <s> i hope that in the light of that reassurance the noble lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right to say it is not stated in the bill the reason being that it is not considered necessary to state it for the observations i made and that is still the position <e> <s> i can only repeat my assurance that the wording of the bill is such that without <e>", "<cs> i accept much of what the noble lord lord underhill said about the importance of the licensed taxi trade and of the protection which taxi licensing gives to the public <e> <s> without therefore denying that private hire cars are also an invaluable part of our transport system i agree that taxis and their users deserve protection from people who pretend to be taxis by putting up signs on their roofs which closely resemble those used by licensed taxis <e>", "<cs> all i can say on this point is that the wording is precisely the same as that in the act <e> <s> what the noble lord lord mishcon says is of itself valid but if the wording were acceptable in the act and has caused no problems it might not be unreasonable to assume that the same would again apply <e> <s> however there is no reason why i should not say that we shall have a look at this matter to see whether there is a <e>", "<cs> judging from what has happened this afternoon i should not have thought that the government were at all seeking to have it both ways <e> <s> this amendment illustrates perhaps rather dramatically the difference in approach between the government and the opposition <e> <s> we are determined to sweep away unnecessary controls and restrictions and we believe that people are most likely to get the transport they require if they are free to arrange it themselves <e> <s> the opposition believe in controls and are apprehensive of freedom <e> <s> we should prefer to hear less about the adverse effects on established bus operators of the formation of commuter clubs and more about the frustrations that commuters now feel when they have no alternative to the inadequate service that the licence-holder chooses to provide or at least their only alternative is the one that they take the private car <e> <s> why should commuters <e>", "<cs> i would only add as i said before that this is fundamental <e> <s> in fact we do not see it at all as the noble lord has said <e> <s> we see an opportunity here indeed to improve that which needs improving <e> <s> there are many people who would disagree with the noble lord lord underhill that what we have is so fine and so wonderful <e> <s> i think there is a great need for improvement here and what we are proposing will meet that need <e> <s> that is why we cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i certainly sympathise with my noble friend <e> <s> indeed he made the case for me <e> <s> i was very much in the same position myself at regular intervals during the day <e> <s> as to this matter i do not want to add much to what i said on the previous amendment except perhaps to say that we intend to allow and indeed to encourage commuter clubs and parents associations to arrange transport for their members to and from work or their children to and from school <e> <s> i believe there is real scope for this <e> <s> i must emphasise that there will still be adequate restrictions to protect the licensed stage carriage bus operator <e> <s> commercial organisations will not be allowed exemption from road service licensing nor will vehicles which stop to pick up and set down and charge fares which vary according to distance travelled <e> <s> unlicensed stage carriage services will not be permitted <e> <s> we must always remember that the vehicles used by those clubs will be full public services vehicles and operated by people with operators licences <e> <s> it is only road service licences that will not be required <e>", "<cs> i must confess if i have heard the noble viscount correctly that i am not aware that the proposal would prevent that <e> <s> should it be otherwise i will certainly come back and say so <e> <s> i believe that the proposal does not in any way affect it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his intervention <e> <s> regarding knowingly the knowingly formulation is defective in two respects <e> <s> this matter was discussed at some length in another place <e> <s> the word knowingly appears now instead of the words without reasonable excuse which were originally in the bill <e> <s> they were removed as a result of an amendment made in another place at the behest of the opposition <e> <s> it will be agreed that this substitution was unfortunate <e> <s> it would cast on the prosecution a burden which it would not otherwise have and which might be unduly onerous <e> <s> on the other hand it would cause injustice to a person accused who may have done or omitted to do something knowingly but blamelessly for example failure to supply information through illness <e>", "<cs> may i just say that not only will i excuse the noble lord for using the phrase but i hope he will do so at regular intervals for a long time to come <e>", "<cs> i think that this amendment highlights the differences that exist between the thinking on this side of the committee and noble lords opposite and indeed between the thinking of the government and the opposition <e> <s> i can understand the motives behind this amendment but i cannot agree that it is necessary or indeed desirable <e> <s> what we have done in subsection of this clause is to set out in very general terms what the traffic commissioners must look at when considering a licence application <e> <s> however let me emphasise that nothing that the bill says precludes examination of any question or argument which affects the public interest <e> <s> it is inconceivable that the effect of a proposed service on existing services would not be a major consideration of the commissioners where that was put to them <e> <s> it is for them to decide having looked at all such arguments whether the grant of a licence would be against the interests of the public <e>", "<cs> the amendment leaves the commissioners with a peculiar decision to make as to whether a person making a representation is a relevant person rather than whether the points being made are relevant <e> <s> i think the noble lord is making something of a mountain out of a molehill if i may say so <e> <s> the only purpose of the change made by <e>", "<cs> all i wish to add is that i have to stand on the point that the bill says that the commissioners would have to have regard to any representations by whomsoever made provided that they were relevant to the application <e> <s> i think that that covers the point all right <e> <s> i feel that the noble lord need have no fears on this matter and we cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thought that when speaking to amendment no <e> <s> i said that my comments then also applied to <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord underhill had his tongue firmly in his cheek when he made his last observation before sitting down because i have to tell him that in fact the government cannot accept this proposal <e> <s> they cannot accept what really is an attempt to reintroduce licensing controls on express services <e> <s> the amendment also introduces new restrictions on contract carriage services which even under the present system are not licensed <e> <s> the opposition clearly want to protect the local network and i understand that but the government have made it clear all along that they are not out to destroy that network <e>", "<cs> i would have thought from all that had gone on earlier in the day that i had been wearing no other cloak <e> <s> indeed it is not without some apprehension that i contemplate what my right honourable friend the minister is going to say when he sees all those items marked down for him to look at <e> <s> he will have to spend a lot of time doing the looking <e> <s> i would hope that noble lords might feel that all else apart the government today at least in your lordships committee have been indeed very willing to be concerned at many of the very fair and apposite points which have been made not least by the noble lord lord mishcon himself <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether i am called upon to comment further <e> <s> if i am i would only say that i am conscious of the great knowledge which my noble friend lord teviot has and which i do not have <e> <s> nevertheless one cannot get away from the fact that the basic principles at least stem back to <e> <s> if we are to argue about the intervening legislation of the last years i would concede that to him by all means <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the government do not share the oppositions enthusiasm for fares control <e> <s> we believe that price controls in general fail to achieve their laudable purpose of keeping prices down but simply add a further bureaucratic complication to the lives of those who are trying to run businesses <e> <s> it is competition not control that keeps prices down <e> <s> that is why we have abolished the price commission and that is why we are getting rid of the automatic control of bus fares by the traffic commissioners <e> <s> i am sure most noble lords would be surprised at the detail of the present control which is not merely of general fare levels or of rates per mile but of every fare of the discount on returns and on season tickets and of the special rates for children <e> <s> this control sometimes involves days of argument in public about the fares policy of a passenger transport executive argument which is often sterile because that fares policy is determined by the democratically elected county council and the proper place for it to be debated is in the council chamber not before the traffic commissioners <e>", "<cs> the clause as drafted leaves no doubt that fares control is a reserve power to be used only to prevent exploitation of a monopoly or destructive undercutting <e> <s> the norm is to be freedom for the operator to fix his own fares in the light of his own commercial judgment and perhaps by revenue support from the local authority <e>", "<cs> i agree that it is right that the traffic commissioners should look at the statutory duties imposed by parliament on operators and to which the noble lord has drawn attention <e> <s> i am sure they will and that they will be very cautious before putting fares conditions on operators who are acting directly in accordance with decisions of elected councils or where fares have been agreed with them in the course of revenue support negotiations <e> <s> they will not be easily swayed by pressure groups to impose conditions which would nullify decisions taken by these councils <e> <s> but the essence of the governments philosophy about which we have heard so much this evening at least on fares control which i explained on the earlier amendments is that there should be no interference except in specified circumstances where it is essential in the public interest <e>", "<cs> i am not sure how far i should indulge in what i should dearly like to do namely debate with the noble lord the esoteric points he makes <e> <s> yes i suppose that if you look back to the time that he mentioned there was a happier spirit prevailing but might it not be said that had some of the things been done then that we are referring to now we would not have some of the problems that we have today <e> <s> however with respect i think that we are moving off the point and certainly off the amendment <e> <s> while i respect as always the points made by noble lords opposite so far as this amendment at least is concerned i fear we can only resist it <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend lord lucas for his comments <e> <s> may i say at once yes the government look kindly upon the amendment as put down because we recognise that there is real concern here <e> <s> there is concern which shows behind this amendment that the commissioners will use their reserve powers to impose conditions more liberal than is envisaged <e> <s> operators would continue then to be trapped in the delays of fares hearings and proceedings while costs shoot up or opportunities are lost <e>", "<cs> this clause replaces section of the transport act which provides for the issue of permits in lieu of road service licences <e> <s> originally it applied only to the use of school buses for adult passengers or to minibus services <e> <s> the scope was extended in the act by removing any limit on vehicle size <e> <s> i applaud the philosophy behind these permits which was to provide a quicker and simpler means of licensing services where the need was clearly greatest on routes where no other service was available to the public <e> <s> however they have not been used as much as we all might have hoped <e> <s> there has been a tendency for operators to go through the whole road service licence hoop instead <e> <s> so clearly the special permits were not meeting the objective <e>", "<cs> i take the point made by the noble viscount and that he is not satisfied in connection with this so may i undertake to take this away and deal with it separately for him <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> that <e>", "<cs> first let me hasten to assure my noble friend lord lucas that the last thing i would do when discussing <e>", "<cs> this is one of the few amendments to which i have been anxious to rise and reply <e> <s> indeed i have been sitting here with pins and needles because if anything has bedevilled local government in the years since reorganisation it has been the whole business of the division of functions and the requirement statutory and otherwise for consultation <e> <s> considering the frustration and aggravation that have occurred between councils of county and district status in the metropolitan and shire areas throughout the <e>", "<cs> with respect in the context of this discussion it is absurd to speak of denying rights to district authorities <e> <s> we are discussing a right that has been requested to statutory consultation <e> <s> that is what we are talking about <e> <s> to suggest as did the noble lord lord ross of marnock that a trial area would be designated without a district having the right to make its representations and views known is absurd <e> <s> as i have said there is a clear requirement for discussion schedule refers to this sufficiently clearly <e> <s> if i am right i think that this is covered on page though perhaps my memory is wrong there <e> <s> can your lordships committee imagine that a county council in contemplating this kind of very extensive proposal would take no notice of the district councils <e> <s> that would be unheard of <e>", "<cs> perhaps the only comment i can make that might be helpful is that if there is concern as my noble friend lord lucas has said about the word notify as opposed to any other word certainly i would undertake to consider that word and discuss it with my right honourable friend <e> <s> if the word notify is what really is the problem then by all means there may be a better word <e> <s> i would not presume to be so sure as to say that there is not that i do not know but i would gladly undertake to discuss it <e> <s> but i would still have to stand on my basic argument because i know from so much bitter experience of the terrible problems and the cumbersome delays to which this statutory requirement could lead <e> <s> i feel more strongly about this perhaps in the case of this amendment than i have in the case of any other amendment to this bill and noble lords opposite have seen me discuss many of them <e> <s> here more than in any other instance is where i am so sure what it would lead to if we laid it down that there should be a statutory requirement to <e>", "<cs> with respect to the <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the bill is right to make trial area designation orders irrevocable for a period of at least two years it was reduced to two years <e> <s> for a trial to be taken seriously by operators the public or local authorities it will have to last for a significant period of time otherwise the opponents of trial areas will press from the first day for revocation adducing any withdrawal of any bus service as evidence that the trial has failed and the energies of local authorities will be directed to dealing with such pressures rather than getting on with the trial itself <e> <s> similarly new operators need an assurance that a trial will last long enough for markets to be tested and presumably some profits made otherwise they will never make the investment needed <e>", "<cs> it really turns upon the point of the minimum period and as we saw from the discussions in another place my right honourable friend moved from three years to two i think in recognition of the validity of the fears expressed then <e> <s> they have been expressed again today <e> <s> i think that is right <e> <s> the fact is that if you are to have trial areas at all and i accept there are many people who would not wish to see them if you accept for the moment that they are going to take place then you need to draw a balance between on the one hand a guaranteed period of time sufficient to encourage operators to if you like have a go and on the other hand the need to take into account the real concerns that have been i think not unfairly expressed as to what happens if it all goes adrift <e>", "<cs> i shall come back to the point i was trying to conclude namely whether two years is on the <e>", "<cs> i presume of course that they would be happier <e> <s> whether they would be happy enough i do not know <e> <s> i suppose in some ways as i am putting the point at the moment it is slightly academic but it is a very interesting and important point that they have raised <e> <s> as regards what the amendment calls for i do not know that i can be helpful <e> <s> i think i have to recognise that if there was any shifting on this point there would be a very real danger <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord responds i think on reflection that the point i was making earlier about two and five is very apposite <e> <s> i wonder whether it might meet the concern if i say that the government will take this away to consider seriously making the minimum period two years and possibly abandoning the five <e> <s> it is a point that i touched on a moment ago <e> <s> i said that it seemed to me that there could be merit in that and the more i think about it the more i am inclined to think there is <e> <s> that could possibly be a halfway house which i am sure will not satisfy those who are against the trial areas <e> <s> but at least it will allow sufficient room for us to proceed with the trial areas to which we are quite committed <e> <s> i offer that as a suggestion <e>", "<cs> i do so confirm <e> <s> that is the point i was making <e>", "<cs> we are talking about the procedural way of dealing with the matter <e> <s> i think i have made it quite clear <e> <s> it would always be open to noble lords opposite to return to the attack in any way they wished if such adjustments as were made by report stage were not in line with what i have intimated <e> <s> but i feel quietly confident that they may well be so <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his help <e> <s> it is as i have said a difficult point but we are not talking of a minimum and a maximum <e> <s> it is the minimum that we are concerned about <e> <s> noble lords opposite were concerned that if a period of over two years was designated then below that it would not be possible for there to be revocation <e> <s> clearly if something is going quite well and is being successful that is what we all want <e> <s> the concern of noble lords was that if something had fallen on its face and was a disaster no one could move below what could have been a period of up to five years <e> <s> i recognise that and that is the point that i want to make <e> <s> but i think that my noble friend need not be too concerned that we would talk of maxima and minima in this way <e> <s> a two-year period is the key one here and it is the revocation aspect that we are concerned with <e>", "<cs> i must confess that when we were discussing the last amendment i thought we were dealing with all the amendments up to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if i may deal with the point which has just been made i do not think that i can move any further on this group of amendments <e> <s> i understand quite clearly the point which the noble lord is making about who it is that applies for revocation but in view of what i said previously about the two-year period i do not want at this point to go any further <e>", "<cs> paragraph of the schedule is important <e> <s> it means that entrepreneurs will not be discouraged from starting services in trial areas and undertaking the necessary investment by the fear that the trial area will be revoked <e> <s> in those circumstances they would be unable because of opposition from others <e>", "<cs> whether or not an alteration of the kind i intimated earlier when dealing with the previous amendment a two-year minimum period would influence the thinking of noble lords opposite on this amendment i do not know <e> <s> if it would then i think they may well care to hold their fire and see whether it takes place <e> <s> i should have thought that this was relevant <e> <s> if you are talking about a five-year period and then of a period of renewal beyond one could talk about a period of three years <e> <s> but if you are talking of a period of two years as may well come about the position might be rather different <e> <s> i wonder whether noble lords would care to think of it in that way <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the clause which is now being moved will make any practical difference to the operation of trial areas <e> <s> i appreciate that there is a difference between the philosophy behind the and transport acts and the conservative philosophy behind this bill <e> <s> but these clauses are unnecessary <e> <s> first there is no proposal to take away the county councils duty to co-ordinate public transport in their areas <e> <s> they will still be able to exercise this duty through discussion with operators and through their revenue support powers that is their powers to make grants <e> <s> it is wrong therefore to suggest that operators should not co-operate with local authorities in trial areas <e>", "<cs> lord bellwin certainly would not be qualified to give an interpretation as to whether the noble lord is in or out of order <e> <s> in the light of what he said a moment ago about what transpired previously i would hope that he might feel that he would wish to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in this part of the bill we seek to introduce procedures for ensuring the safety of public service vehicles which are comparable to those already in the road traffic acts for ensuring the safety of heavy goods vehicles <e> <s> the power sought to make prohibitions clearable only at testing stations is similar to that which already exists in relation to heavy goods vehicles which are subject to prohibition and the same reasoning applies namely that in certain cases there will exist only at testing stations the facilities necessary for the proper verification that the faults which led to the prohibition have been remedied <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the concern which has led the noble lord lord underhill to move this amendment <e> <s> the philosophy behind the bill however is that licensing and controls should be removed wherever they are not essential in the public interest and i have not been entirely convinced that a control of this sort is essential <e> <s> we believe that operators licensing will itself provide the necessary safeguards in the public interest on the good repute and financial standing of the operators and it is really doubts about these i suspect that are at the back of the amendment <e> <s> i do not think the traffic commissioners should concern themselves with the organisation of the <e>", "<cs> i would not even pretend to try to answer the noble lord on the points that he raises <e> <s> i think it would be fair to say that i do not think that the matters on which he has just touched come within the province of this bill <e> <s> if i am proved to be wrong then of course i will get in touch with him but so far as i am aware i do not think it is apposite to this <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure whether the noble lord lord mishcon requires a further comment from me <e> <s> it was always interesting to me during the past in another incarnation to know how temporary is temporarily <e> <s> there is really no answer <e> <s> one can set out temporary or temporarily in the light of given sets of circumstances or situations but without something more specific it is very difficult so to do <e> <s> i could give to your lordships a list which i have before me of situations which would without argument i think be shown to be tempor <e>", "<cs> my right honourable friend and i do not share the alarmist view that the system which we were proposing without discs would cause safety standards to slip <e> <s> after all the vehicle testing and inspection provisions in the bill are the most comprehensive that this country has ever seen <e> <s> but we do not wish to create additional problems for the enforcement agencies which have a hard enough task as things are <e> <s> we are therefore considering the reinstatement of a clause on discs similar to the one which stands on the marshalled list <e> <s> so in many ways both my noble friend lord teviot and the noble lord lord underhill are pushing at an open door because i am happy to be able to say without going into a lot more detail as i could and if pressed will that while i cannot agree to this clause in its present form i can give an assurance to the noble lords who have spoken that we shall introduce a very similar clause at report stage <e> <s> therefore i ask the noble lord not to press his amendment <e>", "<cs> the most courteous way in which i can answer that is to say that i too shall not repeat my speech <e>", "<cs> i certainly and gladly give that undertaking <e> <s> i follow the line of argument and yes i think perhaps the best way to deal with it would be as the noble lord suggested <e> <s> we will have a look at the definitions and the terms and see whether we can be helpful <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i can help my noble friend regarding the intention on this point <e> <s> so far as i am aware there is no intention to change the basic procedure as to that the basic requirements now being set down in the bill which calls as he knows for the certificate as to good repute professional competence and so on will apply generally <e> <s> i would not have thought there was any reason why what will pertain here will be any different from what will pertain in northern ireland <e> <s> i will gladly undertake to have a look at this point and see if i can confirm this and satisfy my noble friend <e>", "<cs> time limits must of course be laid down within which appeals can be made <e> <s> at present they are contained in regulations under the road traffic act along with other necessary requirements about the procedure for making appeals <e> <s> subsection of this clause provides that such matters must be prescribed in regulations and this amendment therefore is not necessary <e> <s> in any case the time limits suggested are very short much shorter than at present <e> <s> it would be unreasonable to impose such stringent requirements on licence holders <e> <s> they are entitled to a reasonable time for consideration of whether or not to pursue an appeal and time to prepare their case <e> <s> at present one month is allowed and we will be discussing and this really is moving towards what the noble lord lord mishcon is wanting with the industry and other interested parties whether this should be changed when we consult with them on the new regulations <e> <s> i hope with that reply that the noble lord may feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> it seems that i will have to alter my approach in the way i refer to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran if i am to get his support to a greater degree than i seem to be doing at present <e> <s> i should have thought the point i made regarding the intention to consult with the industry and with other interested parties was the relevant one <e> <s> we are not saying are we <e> <s> that there should be no time <e> <s> we are certainly very dubious about the time of seven days proposed in the amendment <e> <s> perhaps it would be helpful if i were to add that in addition to the present regulations there is a leaflet fully explaining the procedure <e> <s> we intend to amend that leaflet and ensure its widest distribution <e> <s> it will contain in <e>", "<cs> i cannot tell the noble lord the extent of the consultations or discussions call them what you will which have taken place already <e> <s> that i do not know <e> <s> the fact that at the present time one month is allowed and here we are talking in an amendment of seven days illustrates the point that there clearly needs to be something more than we have at the present time <e> <s> whether that should be done in the procedural way suggested or in the way that the noble lord says is a matter of opinion <e> <s> at the end of the day what really matters is that we get a time that is reasonable to all concerned and who more concerned i would have thought than the people within the industry and the interested parties themselves <e> <s> i do not think i can add much more although i am trying to be helpful <e> <s> for the third time i wonder whether the noble lord feels able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i gladly undertake as the noble lord lord mishcon said to see whether by the time of the report stage we have something which may enable him to feel happier about what we have here <e> <s> at this moment i cannot offer anything but i will certainly undertake to do that <e>", "<cs> subsection empowers traffic commissioners if so requested to suspend the operation of a change in the conditions of a licence or its revocation suspension or curtailment until the expiration of the period within which an appeal must be lodged and then until the appeal is disposed of <e> <s> if the commissioners refuse to grant such a suspension of the operation of their decision there may be an application to the minister to direct them to grant it and there must be a decision on such an application within days <e> <s> a similar provision is to be found in the goods operator licensing system for goods vehicles <e>", "<cs> i was aware that i was in fact stating the position but i felt that it was as the noble lord has said such a complex subject that there was no harm in doing that <e> <s> indeed we may well feel the need to do that again before the day is out <e> <s> i take the point that is being made and i have found difficulty in trying to be precisely clear as to exactly what is the point which has most concerned the noble lord <e> <s> i think i would have no difficulty at all in saying that we will consider this very carefully again before report <e> <s> i gladly undertake to do so <e>", "<cs> i listened very carefully to what my noble friend lord morris said on this amendment but i should have thought this was essentially a matter of judgment <e> <s> how far should we go in laying down safeguards for every eventuality <e> <s> when do we reach the point when we say that we should leave it to the good sense of the traffic commissioners <e> <s> after all why do we have independent tribunals if we are not prepared to trust them with this kind of judgment <e>", "<cs> before i answer the noble lord may i ask him whether he has overlooked subsection of amendment no <e> <s> a which says <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i can give the noble lord that assurance <e> <s> i can only say and i seem to be saying it very much this afternoon because the sun is apparently still shining that we will look at that as a possibility <e> <s> i fear that it cannot by itself preclude and i am sure the noble lord does not expect it my moving the amendment <e> <s> i can only say again that because we are anxious that at the end of the day the bill should be the very best bill and that it should allow for all possible eventualities that one can foresee of course we will take note of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble lord says and i presume he said the same thing when we discussed it earlier <e> <s> as i recall i think i answered then by saying that a definition of this would take into account the -mile limit which we were talking about then <e> <s> i will certainly refer to this again when we come to look at it as we shall be doing <e>", "<cs> i am rather surprised that the noble lord lord underhill made some of the points which he has made <e> <s> in fact the noble lord may know that there were consultations with the trade union to which he refers quite what the outcome of those were i am not in a position to say <e> <s> but for myself i had assumed that that trade union had not objected to what is now being proposed <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the legal position at present is that the railways board has powers to operate bus services where the rail service has been temporarily interrupted or in replacement of a railway passenger service which has been closed <e> <s> the government are not aware of any circumstances which might arise in the future which would make it necessary for the board to have wider powers to operate bus services than those which it already has <e> <s> the railways board has made no representations to my right honourable friend the minister about the need for wider powers although of course it is always open to them to do so <e>", "<cs> obviously i do not know what representations mr albert booth has or has not made <e> <s> what i do know is what i have already said that to the best of my knowledge and information and as recently as today no one has altered it the railways board has made no such representations <e> <s> i should have thought that that was most apposite <e> <s> however i shall of course make inquiries along the lines which the noble lord lord underhill suggests <e> <s> if there should prove to be a need further to consider the point the noble lord can be assured that it will be considered <e> <s> however as i stand here at the moment i should have thought that the most significant point is the one about the attitude of the british railways board <e>", "<cs> there are already circumstances and situations in which british rail make arrangements with bus operators to provide bus links to rail networks <e> <s> i am reminded that a recent example is the new kettering to corby bus service <e> <s> all i can add to what i said before is that for myself the mind boggles when one considers some of the problems that would face both kinds of service <e> <s> if we were to have it laid down that there should be obligations for them to coordinate in the way that i understand the amendment means then i can think of all sorts of great problems which would arise <e> <s> however bearing in mind that there obviously is flexibility or room for flexibility at the present time i thought that that might have satisfied noble lords <e>", "<cs> i do not know if the noble lord lord mishcon will consider my remarks helpful <e> <s> i suspect he may consider them not unhelpful but perhaps not sufficiently helpful to get him to where he would like to be <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that the eec rules on drivers hours were agreed long before we joined <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can go much farther on this matter <e> <s> i am surprised if in fact the noble lord lord mishcon is really pressing the point that we should follow the french example which in so many ways we deplore when they depart from the regulations <e> <s> i should not have thought that that was the way we wanted to go <e> <s> nevertheless the noble lord made some very telling observations in his closing points <e> <s> i certainly cannot agree that we can accept this matter <e> <s> i repeat what i said previously namely that we are obliged to consider carefully the points that the noble lord makes particularly his final points <e> <s> i assure him that we shall look at them very carefully but for the moment i cannot accept the amendment as it stands <e>", "<cs> i can gladly assure the noble lord that we are in fact looking at it and that i will certainly let him have this decision and anything else which goes with it by the time we come to report stage <e>", "<cs> i think the need for this amendment falls with the amendment to clause <e> <s> if there was no general test of availability to the general public for eligibility for fuel duty rebates and new bus grant i can see that one might be required in trial areas but it must surely be right for the availability test to be general <e> <s> the new bus grant and fuel duty rebate have always been designed to help the local bus network <e> <s> as a consequence of the changes in definitions of the different categories of bus service made by this bill it has been necessary to change the criteria for eligibility for these grants <e> <s> in doing this we have kept the basic purpose of the grants always before us <e> <s> they were not intended to help services with a special clientele and in the past most of these have been excluded by the minimum fare condition of the stage carriage <e> <s> we are now excluding them in so many words <e>", "<cs> all i can add really is that since availability to the general public is to be a criterion of eligibility throughout great britain there is no need for any special provision for the trial areas <e> <s> as to the other points made i fear there is nothing more i can add at this time but i would have thought that the arguments made were pretty convincing in this instance <e> <s> i hope the noble lord may feel so <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say <e>", "<cs> the matter has been so beautifully put that i should like only to say that although it is quite true that in another incarnation i was always impressed by the independence of individual councillors i was also impressed by the fact that when the time came to put your hand up to vote you alv/ays voted in line with the party and so i fear that the independence broke down at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> no i have already found that is not the experience in this place i entirely accept that without question <e> <s> i must say in fairness however before i leave this that i occasionally found the same thing in another sphere <e> <s> i accept that the appointed day order is an important technical device in determining exactly when the nfcs undertaking is to be transferred to the successor company but the appointed day will not represent any new policy departure or give rise to any new issues of substance <e> <s> it will merely give effect to the provisions set out in part ii of the bill and to which parliament will have already given approval <e> <s> thus it is quite inappropriate for the appointed day order to be subject to an affirmative resolution or for that matter to any additional parliamentary procedure <e> <s> it would simply mean repeating discussion which had already been held and extensively held on the bill itself <e>", "<cs> i really feel that we are making of this something which it is not <e> <s> i should repeat what i said before but perhaps in another way <e> <s> the fact is that on this matter of such great moment to which the noble lord lord mishcon is drawing attention the order designating the appointed day will not be subject to parliamentary procedure as it will not involve any new policy departure <e> <s> the noble lord said that i had not given any reason why we take this line but i thought that i had given the very best reason of all namely that the matter would have been extensively discussed on the bill itself <e> <s> that has been so in another place and will be so here <e>", "<cs> that is absolutely right <e> <s> the purpose and effect of the amendment as i am advised and as i interpret it is to make subject to affirmative resolution the order whereby the minister with the consent of the treasury appoints the day on which the nfcs undertaking is transferred to the successor company <e> <s> as drafted the order is not at all subject to parliamentary procedure <e>", "<cs> i must make one <e>", "<cs> there is no question whatsoever of the governments existing financial interest in nfc just being thrown to one side <e> <s> the debt will not be written <e>", "<cs> of coure i gladly undertake to do that <e> <s> i am sorry indeed about the inability to deliver the notes on clauses <e> <s> we have done so as regards just about all the clauses in the bill as best we could but with the great pressures of time and the pressures that there are on everybody it sometimes happens that it is not possible and this was one of those times <e> <s> yes of course i shall endeavour to see that the noble lord has a reply to his three questions <e> <s> i was wondering whether he would have asked a fourth question <e>", "<cs> this amendment would impose duties concerning industrial democracy on the successor company along the lines of those to which the nfc is subject as a nationalised transport industry <e> <s> the government are very much in favour of genuine consultation and participation in industry <e> <s> their commitment in this area is demonstrated by the insertion in the companies bill at present before parliament of a provision to require directors to have regard to the interests of the companys employees in general as well as the interests of its members <e>", "<cs> the section of the act which this amendment seeks to apply to the successor company typifies the unnecessary restrictions under which the nfc is forced to operate as a nationalised industry <e> <s> clearly the successor company will while operating commercially carry out research in those areas which may be of value to it <e> <s> to impose a statutory obligation to do so on a private company would however be totally inappropriate and contrary to the aims of the bill which seeks precisely to remove restrictions of this kind <e> <s> like some other amendments on this part of the bill by noble lords opposite this amendment seeks to impose on the successor company statutory obligations of exactly the kind which this bill seeks to remove <e> <s> these are the very kind of public sector obligations which many think have held back the nfc from achieving its potential <e> <s> we cannot accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> as i speak i do not know how many of the staff are engaged on research facilities <e> <s> i do not know if any are engaged solely and only on research facilities <e> <s> clearly i do not know that at this moment in time <e> <s> but the intention of the bill is to transfer the ownership of the successor company and that will operate as a commercial company <e> <s> if in the past this activity has been proven by carrying out research as it has been carried out or in some other way that they may so wish then of course they will continue to do so <e> <s> but clearly it would be impossible to impose a statutory obligation on a company to which in effect we shall be selling the nfc that they should among other things carry out research for some purpose which may then be entirely inappropriate to what they are doing <e> <s> as to what the staff would do i repeat that it depends on what staff we are talking about what exactly they are doing and what the direction will be of the successor company <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one further observation on this <e> <s> if the successor company should be satisfied that what is being achieved by the research is indeed of such importance to the future advancement of the national freight corporation i have no doubt whatever but that they will continue to do exactly the same thing <e> <s> if it really is so good they would be rather foolish not to go on doing so <e> <s> but who is to say and who is to know <e> <s> certainly not us at this moment <e>", "<cs> with respect i should have to say that it is not the government that does not know it is i speaking here who do not have this particular information at my fingertips <e> <s> i am quite sure that there will not be the slightest difficulty in my getting this information <e> <s> whether it has relevance to the issue i doubt very much <e>", "<cs> there is no problem at all in my confirming that because it is the clearly expressed intention that the government want the nfc to go over in its entirety to the successor company so there is no difficulty in my saying yes to the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> if it is doctrinaire to wish to transfer control of the nfc firmly fully and irrevocably to the private sector then surely it is equally doctrinaire from the other point of view to wish to retain it as it is at present or to retain a control <e> <s> i take the last point of the noble lord lord mishcon it is quite right by itself <e> <s> however in the context of what we are discussing here i consider that the point made by my noble friend lord morris is apposite <e>", "<cs> i am open to correction here but i would have thought that there was no question of the danger which the noble lord mentions <e> <s> if the employment is taken over by a successor company or another company then they certainly also take over the responsibilities to the employees of that company as regards redundancy or whatever <e> <s> i would have thought that that was absolutely so <e>", "<cs> i would not think <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon may quote me as a disciple with exactly the same views but that is not to say that because of that we feel the amendment is necessary <e> <s> the essential purpose of the bill is to enable shares in the successor company to be sold to investors with the aim of transferring control of the enterprise as a whole to the private sector <e> <s> the government have repeatedly made it clear that they have absolutely no intention of bringing about separate disposal of subsidiary companies <e> <s> but in any case the shares of the subsidiaries will be held by the successor company rather than by the minister <e>", "<cs> i must confess i am not entirely with the point <e> <s> the amendment as i understand it would add a new subsection to clause restricting the way in which securities of the successor company are offered for sale <e> <s> the proposed subsection would stipulate that the securities offered for sale must be of the successor company and not of any of its subsidiaries <e> <s> we are talking about the intentions of the government in selling the nfc to the successor company <e> <s> the quotations that the noble lord read out and which i have confirmed tonight make it clear that that is the intention that it will be sold to the successor company as a whole entity <e> <s> but the amendment goes on to restrict the way in which shares of the successor company are offered for sale <e> <s> that was not the same thing <e> <s> i think our intention is the same but as i understand the way in which the <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble viscount <e> <s> that is quite right <e> <s> when one figures through a process of course that is absolutely right <e> <s> that is exactly the way it is intended <e> <s> i still make the same point namely the amendment is not necessary because the intention is as i have said that the company be disposed of as a whole in its entirety <e> <s> those were the quotations which the noble lord read out and with which i concur <e>", "<cs> there is a difference here a difference of interpretation or understanding <e> <s> the fact is that the minister will never own any shares in the subsidiary company at all <e> <s> therefore there can be no question of his disposing of them <e> <s> maybe that is where we are at slightly cross purposes <e> <s> the shares will <e>", "<cs> not quite <e> <s> on that basis i could not accept it <e> <s> the basis is the one that i have said <e> <s> if it should prove to be that the wording of the amendment means contrary to what i think it means that it in no way inhibits the governments intentions in this matter then of course we shall accept it <e> <s> but only if it should do that <e> <s> i will gladly say as i said a moment ago that of course we will look at it <e>", "<cs> yes i am pleased to confirm that that is so <e> <s> i too have a set piece to say but i feel perhaps in the circumstances there is no need to deal with that <e> <s> it will be as i said previously the memorandum and articles of association will be made available and a copy will be put in the library of the house before the appointed day <e> <s> unless the noble lord wishes me to expand on the point i shall be quite happy not to do so <e>", "<cs> i believe this amendment springs from a misconception which i understood had been cleared up in another place <e> <s> it seeks to withhold from the successor company any tax losses which before the appointed day were available to the nfc <e> <s> but as my honourable friend in another place spelt out in committee and i would refer here to <e>", "<cs> this new clause would impose an intolerable limitation on the commercial freedom of the new company <e> <s> there is no reason why the company should wish to dispose of any property on a large scale <e> <s> but it is essential that it can take advantage of any opportunities to dispose of property no longer required as and when these arise without going through the laborious procedure of seeking ministerial consent in the way that the new clause proposes <e> <s> such restrictions could prevent any negotiations from ever being completed <e> <s> disposal of redundant property is a normal part of everyday commercial activity indeed the nfc does it now without prompting any controversy <e> <s> the whole purpose of the bill is to ensure that the new company as from the appointed day has the commercial freedom enjoyed by any private sector company <e> <s> this new clause would be entirely inconsistent with this and for that reason we cannot accept it <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord knows i am at all times anxious to be helpful <e> <s> indeed throughout all the -odd amendments that we have discussed we have in the main been so <e> <s> but we are now talking about fundamentals on <e>", "<cs> the concern over this issue while fully understood is in my view entirely misplaced <e> <s> employees have no cause to fear the transfer of ownership to the private sector <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> of course i shall readily and gladly do that <e> <s> i may be able to help a little by confirming that we intend interpretation b rather than interpretation a certainly we shall look at all the other points and we might have to do this in regard to the complex matters relating to many other amendments with which we are yet to deal <e> <s> it is very difficult to absorb this kind of matter the first time round without looking at it in writing and i am sure that no one on either side would expect otherwise <e>", "<cs> we are dealing with amendments no <e> <s> and as i understand it nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and were tabled also in another place and my honourable and learned friend the parliamentary secretary agreed to consider the point which they raised <e> <s> as a result government amendment no <e> <s> a has appeared on the order paper <e> <s> it is one of a group of government amendments on transfer values and if the noble lord lord mishcon is willing to withdraw amendments nos <e> <s> and perhaps i might speak to the government amendments on transfer values as a group <e> <s> a number of rather complex points arise on this amendment and it may assist the committee if i briefly explain the background before i come to the point of the amendments <e>", "<cs> the question of the choice of actuarial assumptions has caused almost as much misunderstanding as the rest of the pensions provisions put together <e> <s> it is said that the bill changes the position that existed under the act <e> <s> let me make the position about the choice of actuarial assumptions quite clear <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord selsdon not only for the amendment but for the way in which he has moved it which i think commands even greater consideration and respect for it than might have been elicited simply by looking at the amendment as originally tabled <e>", "<cs> i clearly cannot say that i can accept the amendment as it is nor do i think that my noble friend lord selsdon is asking me to do that <e> <s> what i can do is to confirm that i think the points that he raises and indeed the other points made by the noble lord lord mishcon in his succeeding amendment are of sufficient merit to deserve our taking it away to have another look <e> <s> where i shall get to with it or where my right honourable friend will get to i cannot say as i stand here now but i say that i think we ought to do just that and i gladly undertake to do that before we come back next time <e>", "<cs> i will only use a term i have heard since arriving in your lordships house i hear what you say <e>", "<cs> in committee in another place the parliamentary secretary promised to think further about this amendment <e> <s> my advice to the committee is that an amendment is not necessary and that for the effect to be achieved it would be necessary to complicate still further what is already a complicated clause <e> <s> the effect of the amendment as drafted would largely be to nullify the purpose of clause <e> <s> once clause had operated once the basic scheme could so arrange matters that the offset under the clause operated for one year only <e> <s> that would be done by arranging for benefits to be increased with effect from one year ahead thus increasing the liabilities of the scheme from that date <e>", "<cs> under the bill the unfunded proportions of unity stand to be determined for the two supplementation schemes that is the british rail pension fund and the nfc pension fund <e> <s> that means that the taxpayer will become responsible for the <e>", "<cs> i will write <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the clause is to secure the abolition of the committee to which the noble viscount referred <e> <s> it forms part of government policy to review and where possible to reduce the number of non-governmental bodies <e> <s> it was established by the then minister in <e> <s> the committee has not met since <e> <s> during the whole of its existence it received no complaints about charges <e> <s> i should have thought that in the circumstances there would not be too much concern <e>", "<cs> contrary to the arguments deployed by my noble friend trial areas are an integral part of the reform of the bus licensing system that this bill is designed to bring about <e> <s> everything we are doing is aimed at increasing competition and efficiency in the bus industry <e> <s> everywhere it will be easier to get road service licences and the balance of presumption before the traffic commissioners will be changed <e> <s> and it will be open to county councils and their scottish equivalents to go further and to choose to have road service licensing abolished altogether in their area <e> <s> county councils may feel and it is a view with which i have much sympathy that unfettered competition will better serve the people of their area than traffic commissioner restrictions <e> <s> if they do they will be able to apply to my right honourable friend the minister for designation as a trial area and after he has considered the proposal and any representations received he will decide whether to make the order as requested <e>", "<cs> my lords the government understand the concern which the noble lord lord boston of faversham expressed about the future of docklands and we are indeed fully aware of the importance of the port of london authority in this respect and we are sure they have a significant role to play in the future prosperity of the area <e> <s> for their part the pla must move with the times and adapt to technological changes mainly by reducing manpower and improving working practices <e> <s> the new urban development corporation will at the same time provide fresh opportunities for investment which have so far been lacking in docklands <e> <s> i fear that the noble lord and i will have to disagree as to the fundamental difficulty which faces the pla <e> <s> he quoted more than once from the price waterhouse report <e> <s> i wonder therefore whether we also are not entitled to rely on that report when it refers to manpower <e> <s> i quoted it earlier and will not do so again because i think the point has been made very firmly <e>", "<cs> my lords this whole area of accountability and publication of information is something which the government are most anxious to encourage <e> <s> indeed recently we have for the first time had published certain statistics regarding manpower levels in different authorities <e> <s> that in turn should lead ultimately through the local government bill which will be coming to your lordships house in due course to other information and other publication which i hope will assist everyone in making their own decisions and in coming to their conclusions about levels of spending between authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation in individual authorities varies very much indeed and it will be for each authority to decide what it can and cannot do <e> <s> but the basic presumption must be an understanding of the reality of the national situation <e> <s> there is a responsibility upon local government just as there is upon every other spending point to make its contribution <e> <s> what each authority does will be for it to decide in the light of its own circumstances but at the end of the day local government must make its contribution to helping to solve the grave national problem <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government wished to tell an individual authority what it should be providing by way of levels of service in each separate instance in the first place it would be totally impossible to do and in the second place it would be so resented by local authorities that it just would not make any sense <e> <s> with great respect to the noble baroness we are now entering into a realm of very great sensitivity where the problem is by no means as simple as she would seek to intimate <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i am not sure of the precise question which the noble lord has put but if he is trying to indicate the hardship that can be caused by high rates then i entirely accept that and hope that it will be brought to the notice of every authority that was responsible for fixing rates in the first place <e> <s> i think that it should also be said that those who really encounter hardship in paying rates have access to the rate allowances which are available <e> <s> however in the main i entirely accept the point which the noble lord has made about high rates <e>", "<cs> my lords as to that i can only say that i would have to refer my noble friend to the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the best contributions that local government can make in individual circumstances to retaining employment and not to driving it out is to keep rates at a level which will not force people to move to other areas where rates are much lower <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot confirm that that is so <e> <s> i do not know <e> <s> if it is so then there are many who would deplore it <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that the noble lord appreciates the significance of the suggestion he has just made because its implications for the whole relationship between central and local government are very great <e> <s> all that i would say on the point is that it is not the governments intention at present to contemplate having a cash limit or a limit of the kind that the noble lord suggests <e> <s> there are certainly those who would have sympathy with his point of view but i would have to say again that the implications are very far-reaching indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords governments do have an influence on expenditure in the main through the rate support grant but they do not have the last word at all on it <e> <s> the last word lies with the locally elected members <e> <s> they decide what they will spend <e> <s> what the government decide is what they will contribute by way of grant and how that grant will be distributed <e> <s> however we are getting into a very broad area of discussion and debate which i am sure will take place in your lordships house at great length before too long <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all apologise to the house for the short notice that was given <e> <s> if it is any comfort i would assure noble lords that i too had the same short notice <e> <s> indeed only this very morning we were receiving as many would you believe <e> <s> as amendments and it is far from easy to absorb it all <e> <s> nevertheless the important thing surely is to be quite satisfied that we are dealing correctly with this matter and in that it is one which was raised by my noble friend lord lucas and so effectively as i said before i would hope that in the circumstances as we have to deal with them the noble lord lord underhill may feel so far as concerns what he had to say on the subject it is now acceptable and perhaps your lordships might accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords just before we leave the subject i think i ought in fairness to say that there are some amendments that i have before me at the moment <e> <s> if we are talking about some just received i think it would be equally fair to say that there were a good number which were dealt with between the committee stage and now <e> <s> furthermore many of them concern very complicated matters which require the most careful consideration and when ministers say in good faith that they will go away and think about matters raised often by the opposition or even by my noble friends on this side they do exactly that <e> <s> these matters are taken away there are consultations about them between ministerial colleagues then there is consultation with officials and then <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that it should not be but it is bound to be if the government take a tolerant attitude at committee stage in being willing to look at matters again rather than saying i am sorry but that is all there is to it and we will divide if you wish to divide and i do not really think that that is what the noble lord would most wish us to do <e> <s> but once we do take that attitude if there are many amendments which we undertake to look at again and furthermore others which follow thereafter often at short notice then i feel we are bound to be in this situation <e> <s> however having said that i feel that noble lords on all sides understand the difficulty and we shall just have to cope with it as best we can trying to be as helpful as we can at all stages <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i would consult i have certainly done so and i am glad to confirm it <e> <s> i have listened to the noble lord lord underhill today as i did in committee <e> <s> furthermore the consultations with my ministerial colleagues to which i refer have been quite extensive <e> <s> but nothing that the noble lord has said today alters my view that this issue boils down to a basic difference in approach <e> <s> we in goverment wish to free as many services as possible from licensing others especially noble lords opposite wish to keep as many as possible within licensing <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill described in committee a hypothetical service from manchester to stoke on trent which by making a four-and-a-half mile dogleg could thereby take passengers over miles from the starting point although not from its destination <e> <s> he is right in saying that i too could have given many other illustrations and i am sure that many others could have done so without difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran thinks i am naive about this <e> <s> he may feel likewise about many other matters before we end this session <e> <s> i hope not but it is possible <e> <s> so far as i am concerned i am convinced about this <e> <s> i understand the concern expressed <e> <s> the points made by my noble friend lord teviot are as always points to which one should pay attention because of his considerable experience and knowledge of this industry but at the same time if one thinks carefully about this in practice it is not going to be what the noble lord thinks <e> <s> the requirement is that the passenger must have travelled at least miles during the course of the journey <e> <s> what we are talking about is a possibility <e> <s> are we seriously saying that operators will deliberately set out to follow a tortuous route to reduce in some way the number of miles travelled <e> <s> it does not make sense <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord underhill has said these amendments would at least by implication take the control away from the local authority in what the government consider to be a crucial respect as far as trial areas are concerned <e> <s> if a trial area can be revoked by the minister regardless of the wishes of the local authority concerned this would undermine the authoritys position <e> <s> this whole subject was very carefully rethought by my ministerial colleagues during the passage of the bill in another place and the conclusion was that the initiative on the revoking of the trial area as indeed in designating it in the first place should rest with the county regional or islands council <e> <s> one could speak at some length on this but one would only come back to what i have just said which is a basic point i think therefore i advise the house that we cannot accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i say quite clearly that i had considerable sympathy as my noble friend said when this matter was raised last time <e> <s> however it is one of so many points that arises from the bill <e> <s> it is a technical bill which moves into areas about which many members do not have great experience <e> <s> i have discovered that one of the virtues of having the various stages is that one can take away and discuss both with ministerial colleagues and with experts and officials matters which may not always be clear at the time <e> <s> that is what i undertook to do and that is what i have done <e> <s> i assure my noble friend and indeed the noble lord lord underhill that we have given particularly careful consideration to the purpose which these amendments set out to fulfil as i promised we would do <e> <s> but having done so we have concluded that on balance it would be undesirable <e>", "<cs> my lords if by leave of the house i may speak again on this it is difficult to say as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has said what the investment would be <e> <s> it would depend upon the county its area and size <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord nugent of guildford for his interjection because what he said is valid <e> <s> it comes back to the point i was making earlier namely how far do you want to make a judgment on something which is a balanced thing <e> <s> if we make it so short that an operator says well for two years i cannot take the risk of buying a bus or buses the scheme will never get off the ground at all <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may beg leave to come in for a third time i am not quite sure how far i am in order although i think probably i am but i suspect the noble lord is not in order <e> <s> the last thing i am going to do is to enter into hypothetical situations or guesses <e> <s> i am not without experience of local authority situations myself <e> <s> i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i too shall be brief on the matter <e> <s> the suggestion that there should be a maximum period for a trial area that it should automatically come to an end after live years is quite new <e> <s> it is our hope of course that a trial area will be a success and that when once road service licensing has gone it will have gone forever <e> <s> however that will remain to be seen <e> <s> without making a meal of this matter in view of what has been said on the previous amendment which quite frankly i originally thought we would discuss at the same time as this amendment i think that what i must say for the government is that we cannot agree to anything which makes revocation automatic <e>", "<cs> my lords before i deal with the point which my noble friend has raised may i say that first i was not aware that i was dealing with matters airily <e> <s> i hope that what i have done so far during the course of this bill or anything else i have been doing does not give an indication that i treat matters airily <e> <s> that certainly is not the intention <e> <s> as i said earlier this afternoon i suspect that before we come to the end of the summer with the various other legislation coming through this house it might be felt that i deal with matters anything but airily <e> <s> however as to that time will tell <e>", "<cs> i have not changed my view since we last discussed this subject <e> <s> i said then that i saw no reason why a road service licence granted to an operator in a trial area which had been revoked should be any different from any other road service licence <e> <s> indeed i can see a case for saying that an operator who has successfully provided a service in the competitive environment of a trial area should be rewarded not penalised <e> <s> but all we propose is that he should be treated equally that is his road service licence should normally last five years like any other <e>", "<cs> my lords i listen with some amusement to the fervour with which noble lords opposite plead the case for there not having to be statutory obligations to co-operate <e> <s> i find it rather amusing because i remember how vigorously on other occasions they pleaded that there should be statutory obligations to consult <e> <s> as i said at the time i do not know how on earth in <e>", "<cs> my lords i too will have to speak in some detail on this point <e> <s> i sympathise with the problems to which the noble lord has drawn attention <e> <s> i realise that the death or sudden insanity of the proprietor of a small business can cause great distress and problems <e> <s> nevertheless i do not think that we need or should make special provision in this bill to deal with such possibilities <e> <s> we need not because prosecutions for illegal operation in the short interval between the death and the traffic commissioners direction are highly unlikely and if they did take place i am sure clause provides adequate defences <e> <s> we must remember that the traffic commissioners direction once obtained will be effective to prevent the termination of the licence that is as from the date on which it would otherwise have terminated <e> <s> the amendments are <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i do by all means say let us have a look at that and see what we might do <e> <s> after all the object is to be helpful and i certainly take the point made <e>", "<cs> my lords i made it clear when i moved this clause in committee that it was part of our policy to keep open as many ways as possible of meeting peoples varied transport needs and that the clause had been drafted to provide the maximum flexibility <e> <s> this amendment runs counter to that policy <e> <s> it would limit the use which local authorities can make of the school buses that they own <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house may i comment upon the safety aspect which i accept ought perhaps to be more fully covered <e> <s> but may i add that i had intended to go in a little more detail into that point on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> therefore i will try to tie the two together by saying that i appreciate that noble lords have shown concern for the safety of operation of these vehicles <e> <s> i can assure them that both i and my ministerial colleagues have thought very deeply about this subject which we do not take lightly <e> <s> however we continue to be of the view that i expressed in committee namely that local authorities are fully responsible bodies and can be trusted to maintain their vehicles properly <e> <s> it is for them to decide what qualifications to require of their drivers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the observations made all round the house on this matter because i entirely accept that this is a very important matter <e> <s> the fact that it was so discussed last time and was so decided upon covers two aspects <e> <s> on the one hand it covers a point made if i may say so by my noble friend lord lucas just now that is do we indeed have time to take the same argument and go over it all again <e> <s> on the other hand the point which the noble lord lord underhill made about the closeness of it is not at all irrelevant and i accept that as such <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that local education authorities will not normally want to provide bus services in other authorities areas and the government are not going to encourage them to do so <e> <s> we are thinking in the whole of this clause of local education authorities and transport planning departments working very closely together and deploying school buses where a local transport need can conveniently be met by them <e> <s> of course this will usually be in the area of the education authority but i do not see why services which cross the boundaries between one authority and another boundaries which are not always natural ones for transport purposes should be prevented <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult to argue against such technical expertise <e> <s> in fact i have before me a number of arguments against what the noble lord lord underhill has said <e> <s> i believe that they are very strong arguments but it would be rather difficult for me to deploy them at this moment in view of the undertaking that i gave on the previous amendment as regard drivers licensing <e> <s> therefore in this case as in the earlier one i must undertake to take the amendment away and consider it in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not consider that this is an anomaly <e> <s> however i appreciate the noble lords reasons for moving the amendment <e> <s> there are indeed arguments in favour of giving the authority to grant permits for larger vehicles to the traffic commissioners <e> <s> there are also arguments in favour of restricting this extension of the minibus act to schemes which have a particular local value and which the local authority have approved <e> <s> the most direct way of doing this is to restrict the authority to grant permits to local authorities designated for the purpose <e> <s> without making a meal of this matter on balance this is what we prefer <e>", "<cs> my lords surprising though it may be to the noble lord lord underhill i welcome this constructive amendment <e> <s> it conforms to the principle of allowing full use of the derogations from eec regulation / which the commission have allowed us <e> <s> as passenger vehicles with up to seats overall are exempt from the regulation within the united kingdom there is no reason why we should keep to the eec minimum age of if we are satisfied that younger drivers can drive these vehicles safely on passenger services <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i confirm the apology which i sent in writing to the noble lord lord underhill for the error which i made at committee stage when i spoke to a similar amendment moved by the noble lord <e> <s> i said then that the british railways board had not made any representations to the minister about the need for wider powers to run bus services <e> <s> i found out subsequently that they had written to the department to say that it would be consistent with the governments objective of encouraging new initiative and enterprise if the present restrictions on the boards powers to carry passengers by road were lifted <e> <s> i have already written to the noble lord apologising for this error and i should like to repeat that apology tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed very much aware of the significance of the per cent <e> <s> to which the noble lord lord mishcon refers <e> <s> the governments object in bringing forward this legislation is quite clear <e> <s> it is to transfer control of the ncf firmly into the private sector <e> <s> we had quite some debates on this last time round but i feel that i should make that quite clear again tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon spoke with great conviction on this matter <e> <s> i should like to speak with equal conviction and make a few points that clearly have to be made <e> <s> the noble lord said that the increases could have qualified under the act but i say they could not <e> <s> as the noble lord said the rules were not changed before st january and i reject entirely the claim that the legislation is retrospective <e> <s> the noble lord said that the increases were promised but that is not the position <e> <s> the increases were a contingency assumption made by the actuary <e> <s> the board took no steps to pursue these <e> <s> the board ignored the allegedly promised increases in the negotiations under the act <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will excuse me i understood he said when he spoke to previous amendments that he was including this one as well <e> <s> he said nos <e> <s> and and i assumed that he would now be talking on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord sandys spoke at some length to a similar amendment at committee stage and i would not wish to repeat all that he said on that occasion <e> <s> i should however like to remind the house of the purpose of part iii of the bill <e> <s> it is intended to reproduce by a different means the support for the boards historic pensions obligations that was to have been provided under the railways act <e> <s> in particular we are seeking to define the relevant pension obligations of the board in clause of the bill in such a way that they equate to the obligations that were to have been supported under the railways act <e> <s> the pensions provisions of the act formed only one part of a comprehensive reconstruction of the boards finances <e> <s> we are not seeking to re-open the general financial settlement laid down in the act <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon said that the government are in some sense being unfair or inequitable <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house of course <e> <s> as the noble lord said this is technical and complicated <e> <s> we shall read very carefully what the noble lord has said <e> <s> he knows my position i have stated it <e> <s> we will read it and consider it he can be assured <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house by itself i am sure that that may be true but it is only an assumption that there would have been the funds available <e> <s> what we are talking about here is the contribution from the government from the taxpayer to the fund <e> <s> as i said and as lord mishcon said it is the form that contribution should take which is in question <e> <s> yes of course it is possible the pension fund could have had these huge capital sums and invested them and had their income <e> <s> but the figures that we were talking about and which the noble lord mentioned the million already paid and the proposal that from onwards the additional billion be paid over seven years in capital sums is only one side of the balance sheet <e> <s> the other side of the balance sheet says i think that the average figure at the moment is million to make good the governments contribution <e> <s> but it is taxpayers money that would go in that form and the government say that the basic object of the exercise is not to give the british rail fund capital sums to invest but to ensure that the historic obligations can be met and they can be met the government say by making these annual support payments <e> <s> you can argue that one is a better way than another but the government say that looking at the totality of the sums as long as there is the assurance we are giving namely to support the ability to pay the historical obligations and that is the key to it that is what matters <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the arguments advanced by the noble lord i am not persuaded that the bill represents a worsening of the position that would have existed under the act <e> <s> it is in relation to supplementation the subject matter of the present clause that the method of support contemplated by the bill differs most markedly from the method that would have been <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for the care which he has taken to study the arguments which i put forward in committee <e> <s> however i am sure that the house needs no reminding that it was late in the evening when the corresponding amendment was reached at committee stage and not all the arguments were fully deployed on that occasion <e> <s> perhaps i may develop an argument on which i touched briefly at the end of my remarks in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords yet again i have before me a long and quite technical dissertation on this whole subject and the problem is to avoid going into it here and now <e> <s> i have to say that we cannot accept this amendment because we could not justify arrangements under which the taxpayer funded any of the <e>", "<cs> no amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> but we have already agreed amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords really it is a question of where to begin <e> <s> i think i should do so by saying that noble lords opposite and indeed all those who have spoken would not really expect me to try to deal with all the points that have been raised many of which are really more appropriate for committee stage where they can be much better debated in detail rather than by my merely giving a riposte to them now <e> <s> at the same time there are a good many comments i wish to make but before i do so may i apologise <e>", "<cs> i will give way in a moment but i want to conclude what i have to say on the right to buy because time is pressing and i do not have much time available <e> <s> i speak from my own personal experience in leeds <e> <s> when we had sold some to houses we carried out a survey to find out where they had been sold <e> <s> was it true that they had been sold only in the better estates <e> <s> the record was there and is there to show that that was not so <e> <s> they were sold on an incredibly broad spread of housing of all the different standards in the city <e> <s> so i will not have anyone tell me that that is not so <e> <s> the tenants of the most desirable residences are clearly those who are least likely to transfer to older accommodation so that sales of such property to sitting tenants have much less effect on opportunities for transfer than some have suggested <e> <s> i will give way to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i will come back in depth to this at the committee stage but when the noble baroness speaks to me about districts in leeds may i ask her to tell me how many houses were sold in middleton belle isle and other parts of the city which she may or may not know but which i assure her are inhabited solely by those whom she not i would call working class people <e> <s> i have forgotten what the noble baronesss other point was about <e>", "<cs> but we shall come back to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend very much for what she has said <e> <s> may i say something about waiting lists <e> <s> they are used as an argument to try to justify something which is unjustifiable <e> <s> i think we should look very carefully at waiting lists i refute entirely the argument that the right to buy will add to the length of waiting lists for the reasons i have given <e> <s> but waiting lists alone do not by any means represent an adequate measure of housing <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a great number of such people who were in the midst of negotiations prior to the local elections in may when control changed and as a consequence sales that were in hand at the time were stopped <e> <s> of course the government regret this very much but at the present time have no powers to do anything about it <e> <s> after the housing bill becomes the law of the land it will be a different matter because in the unlikely event that any local authority should then decide not to comply with the law under clause of the bill there will be powers for the <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time i have to say that the article was thoroughly misleading and totally wrong <e> <s> there are no such guidelines issued <e> <s> i stand categorically on what i said in my original answer <e> <s> the statistics sent out for rent officers was information listing registered rents for the years <e> <s> what deductions may have been drawn from that information by the newspaper to which the noble lord refers or by any other newspaper is up to the newspaper concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the information sent consisted of facts of what had gone before <e> <s> what one deduces from that and what projections are made is up to the individual <e> <s> one must understand that under the rent acts it is the duty of rent officers only to establish what fair rents should be <e> <s> they will continue to do that under the statutory requirements which are laid down <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no secret about this <e> <s> the procedure is the same as pertained under the previous administration and as has pertained ever since the rent acts called for this procedure <e> <s> the information to which the noble baroness referred is readily available in all sorts of places <e> <s> if she wishes to have copies i can arrange for her or for anyone else to have them <e> <s> there is nothing secret about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said many times from this box that the act lays down that scarcity assets must not be taken into account in calculating what the fair rents will be <e> <s> each rent officer in his own district presumably comes to conclusions based on the procedures laid down in the act <e> <s> i am sorry that i cannot be more helpful to the noble lord lord janner on this point <e> <s> i try to be helpful if i can <e>", "<cs> my lords if at this moment i were to give a dissertation on the definition of scarcity value i should have to keep your lordships longer than question time allows <e> <s> most noble lords know what it is <e> <s> it is that it does not take into account the market value based upon the amount of accommodation which is or which is not available <e> <s> it is what it says <e> <s> if there is undue scarcity that cannot be taken into account in the calculation in establishing the figure <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to go beyond that why do we not make special arrangements and perhaps take an occasion for a debate or discussion when i shall be glad to discuss the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord the question that he has raised is totally different from that on the order paper <e> <s> may we not stick to that on the order paper <e> <s> as far as being coy i am not aware that i am particularly coy <e> <s> if at any time the noble lord wishes to discuss housing rents and i am sure that there will be many occasions very shortly to do so i shall be happy to discuss the matter with him <e>", "<cs> no my lords nor would i attempt now to do so <e> <s> i think it has nothing to do with the question which is all to do with the individual calculations made by individual rent officers all over the country <e> <s> to try to make generalisations would be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say in general terms that the increases have not been greater than the inflation rate <e> <s> but again this is the kind of information with respect that if the noble lord wishes to have in detail and will write to me i will gladly send him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for those helpful remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships would expect i do not by any means accept the thesis that the noble lord submitted <e> <s> i think that the first thing that local government has to do and there are many authorities doing it is to ensure that they are getting value for the money that they spend <e> <s> i would hope that no one in this house would for a moment intimate that that is not possible because it is possible <e> <s> until that has <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that point <e> <s> i hoped i had touched upon it in my first response <e> <s> i am aware that that is so but it is unfortunate that sometimes the actions of certain local authorities of which it would have to be said that lambeth is one although not the only one in total contribute a great deal which rebounds adversely upon local government as a whole when most people in local government are trying to do what the government have said needs to be done to restore the economy to where it has to be <e> <s> then will be the time to talk about services being improved in the way that we all want to see them improved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not responsible for the questions that are put down or for the way in which they are put down <e> <s> i can only suspect that it is because lambeth has been more vocal than others in declaring its intention to try to thwart the policies of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much aware of the point that the noble lord makes <e> <s> may i add strength to his point by reminding him if as a lambeth ratepayer he needs to be reminded which i doubt that the per cent <e> <s> to which he referred goes on top of the per cent <e> <s> in the previous year <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord says that it is interfering with local authorities to call on them to follow national policies i would remind the noble lord of the infamous circular of which the previous administration put out and to which local authorities responded in the way in which i am hoping they will respond to the circulars of the present government <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is entitled to his view my lords <e> <s> i represent a government which have set policies for which they have a mandate from the people as a whole <e> <s> they are entitled to expect that lambeth or any other local authority pay and do their share to contributing to enable them to carry out those policies in the same way as i said a moment ago that local government as a whole did for the previous administration in <e>", "<cs> i resist both amendments nos <e> <s> and my lords but first i would say in answer to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that i am most concerned at his concern at not having received copies of communications <e> <s> while the communications regarding these amendments have not been in written form i have been in communication verbally in trying to be helpful to the noble lord lord underhill in the technicalities of the matter because we have an obligation to do that and we will always try to do it <e> <s> when however he makes the point of other communications not having been copied i undertake to look very thoroughly after this discussion into all such points to ensure that in future neither he nor any other noble lord will ever again be able to say to me that i have not sent copies of communications that should have been sent <e> <s> i gladly undertake to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i will take careful note not only of what was said on the previous amendment but of what the noble lord has now said <e> <s> but on this amendment in so far as the cases are not on all fours the case against requiring psv driver licences for people driving these vehicles is stronger <e> <s> first they will often be volunteers driving the vehicles only intermittently and their willingness to undertake the task would be reduced if the trouble and expense of psv driver licensing were required <e>", "<cs> my lords to be helpful the point which came up last time was that a journey could begin here and it would be national in the sense that it was within this country <e> <s> but it could then proceed on to the continent when it would become international <e> <s> it is in that sense that i used the words national and international <e> <s> one is within the confines of the united kingdom and the other is within the eec area <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by saying yet again that i too would like to pay tribute to the noble lord lord mishcon certainly for his great eloquence on this subject and also for the very fair way in which he has presented the case as he sees it <e> <s> we have had now a number of debates on this particular issue and it is rather remarkable to me that what is such a complex matter has become i would like to think as familiar <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way for a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i did indeed speak at some length to these amendments when we considered them in committee and again when we debated them on report <e> <s> i will try not to go over <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke in reply to this amendment in committee a month ago and there is not a great deal that i can add to what i said on that occasion <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon has again referred to the letter that was written from the department of transport in december <e> <s> in committee i explained the circumstances in which that letter was written as did my learned friend the parliamentary secretary in committee in another place <e> <s> i can only repeat that far too much weight is being placed on that letter and not enough regard is being had to its context <e> <s> the railways act placed the legal responsibility for determining the amount of funding debt to be created under that act on the minister and it cannot have been the intention in that that responsibility should in effect be discharged by some other person <e>", "<cs> after that my lords what can i say <e> <s> i am in fact very pleased that the noble lord has tabled an amendment which for once i can accept <e> <s> i do not wish to detract from what i have just said but i hasten to say and i know the noble lord will forgive my saying it that my acceptance is limited to his amendment and perhaps not necessarily to all the arguments which were employed previously in support of this matter <e> <s> i hope i am not spoiling it by saying that but i think i have to say it <e> <s> i could go on and refer to my brief but i feel there is not much point in it <e> <s> we are glad to make the gesture <e> <s> it could be argued that it is little enough on the other hand i think the points i made in the past were absolutely valid <e> <s> yet we accept this and i am glad so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given careful consideration to these amendments which would extend the ban on roof signs to cover signs anywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to be as specific as my noble friend would wish but i undertake to take up this matter elsewhere <e> <s> i will write to him and to any other noble lord who may be interested <e> <s> i think that his point is a valid one <e> <s> if we can do what he says at that time then it brings it closer to a time when decisions will be made <e> <s> i have tried to indicate that we are concerned about this <e> <s> i shall certainly write to him on that <e>", "<cs> my lord if the noble lord will give way i have had it confirmed that the review to which my noble friend referred is taking place <e> <s> it is hoped to produce a consultation document during this year <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have indicated in a letter to the noble lord lord underhill we have considered these two amendments and have concluded that they do indeed render clause more straightforward <e> <s> i am happy to <e>", "<cs> my lords i have written to the noble lord lord underhill explaining that clause which bans roof signs on vehicles other than taxis extends to private vehicles used for car sharing <e> <s> it covers any vehicle which is used for carrying passengers for hire or reward <e> <s> although vehicles not used in the course of a business of carrying passengers are exempted from bus licensing by clause they are still carrying passengers for hire or reward and are therefore caught by this clause <e> <s> all vehicles other than taxis will be prohibited from masquerading as taxis <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that the bill do now pass i feel it proper that i should make a brief reference to a report which your lordships may have seen in the press today about the effect of this bill <e> <s> the comment was made by the noble lord lord shepherd on the publication of the annual report and accounts of the national bus company <e> <s> i feel it proper that some reply on behalf of the government is called for and i shall do it briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that if i have learned anything and i hope <e>", "<cs> my lords this decision follows the one made by my right honourable friend when he decided not to make these papers available in another place <e> <s> instead my right honourable friend the minister offered to explain any points which might be causing difficulty to the standing committee which considered the bill in another place <e> <s> noble lords will know that many such points were raised in that committee and my right honourable friend went to great lengths to provide the explanations that were sought in terms which were readily understandable <e> <s> i am sure that this was far more useful to them than to have copies of the lengthy and technical notes on clauses <e> <s> of course i will gladly do no less <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether yes probably means yes of course <e> <s> i would not have thought it necessarily meant the same thing but that is not for me to say <e> <s> just to have the record straight may i say that those of your lordships who have not seen that which has been prepared and put into the library and who are interested in the bill ought to take the opportunity so to do because for <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said that i undertake to give any explanations way beyond what noble lords may themselves have to delve out in dealing with the whole of this bill <e> <s> i have said so and i will do so <e> <s> beyond that i do not think i can go at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble and learned lord does <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will bear with me <e> <s> i did not want it wasting its time in getting out a whole list of precedents <e> <s> but of course it would gladly do so if it was felt that i needed to make a greater case <e> <s> i really do not think i do <e>", "<cs> i hope your lordships will agree that i always listen very carefully to what is said <e> <s> i am really not very clear as to the significance of the intimation that perhaps i might not do so on this occasion but i gladly assure my noble friend he need have no fears as to that <e> <s> indeed i have listened very carefully to his explanation of the intention behind his amendment <e> <s> i was a little puzzled when i first saw it because its effect is to leave housing associations with a duty to provide mortgages for their tenants exercising the right to buy and it seemed to me unlikely that this was what my noble friend really wanted to achieve <e>", "<cs> it is not for me at this time to try to give intimations as to what percentage of tenants will want to finance their purchases in any specific way <e> <s> as i have said some will go to building societies some will go to the other sources available to them some will bring forth their own resources and it may perhaps surprise my noble friend to know that there are many who do precisely that in other spheres too <e> <s> so clearly there is no way in which one could contemplate estimating a figure at this stage but i have indicated that the government recognise that as part of this whole exercise there will be a responsibility upon the housing corporation and we shall bear that well in mind once we know what the general parameters of that are likely to be <e>", "<cs> may i begin by referring to one or two observations made by the noble lord lord evans and say at once that i refute his point about what he called ghettos <e> <s> i am sure that we are going to have many opportunities to debate this particular aspect and for that matter the point of options which the noble baroness lady birk touched on is something to which i am sure we shall return later <e> <s> the noble lord lord evans referred to his concern about this leading to a changed class structure within council estates <e> <s> may i remind him that at the present time there is only one class structure within council estates and that if these proposals lead to anything which will widen the social content within council estates that can only be a good thing <e> <s> i should have thought that that would have been as much welcomed by the noble lord as by anybody else <e> <s> the fact is that the mixed social content to which he referred is something which everyone professes to wish to see <e> <s> this government are trying to do something now to make it come about yet it is being opposed in the way that it is <e> <s> i am sure that we shall be discussing this point many times before even this day is out <e> <s> the noble lords amendment proposes a restriction on the right to buy which would narrow its scope significantly <e> <s> the bill as it stands provides that a secure tenant becomes qualified to exercise the right to buy when he has been a secure tenant for not less than three years whether or not the three years have been spent in the same dwelling or as a tenant of the same landlord <e> <s> the noble lord proposes to change this by providing for the right to arise only when the tenant has been for at least three years the secure tenant of the particular dwelling that he wishes to buy <e>", "<cs> it is right that we should have had a far-ranging debate on this clause which is a fundamental part of the bill <e> <s> if some of the topics about which noble lords have spoken are ones which we shall be discussing in greater depth as we deal with the various amendments it is none the worse that we should be debating the principles at the beginning of these few days in which we shall be discussing the bill line by line <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> of course i see the role of housing associations and co-ownership <e> <s> that was the very thing that i was trying to say <e> <s> i believe in the greatest possible number of different forms of housing and that is what i want to see <e> <s> if i misunderstood the noble lord then i am very glad that the matter is now clear <e> <s> it makes me feel much better about his views on housing <e>", "<cs> no i have a long speech to make on this question and i would beg the indulgence of your lordships committee <e>", "<cs> i undertake to do that before we finish the debate <e> <s> i do not carry those particular figures in my head though i carry many other figures in my head <e> <s> the noble lord can he assured that i do not lightly trot out the figures when i say that there was a per cent <e> <s> reduction during the period in question <e> <s> there is no doubt about that <e> <s> i think that the figures showed a reduction in the region of from million to million <e> <s> i shall be interested in due course to see how near i am <e> <s> if i have the figures almost right i shall be very surprised or perhaps i shall not <e>", "<cs> before i comment on that perhaps i may apologise to the noble lord lord evans because i did not reply to some of the things he said <e> <s> i do not want to draw out the proceedings but will try to answer him very briefly because i feel i owe it to him to try quickly to do so <e> <s> he said he was in favour of the basic <e>", "<cs> i would have to say that so far as i am concerned technically the noble lord may be right i say may be right but noble lords have only to have read the papers to have read of the battle <e> <s> i do not think that in reality anyone would accept that that was so <e>", "<cs> i said at the beginning that i would listen very carefully to what was said during the various debates and i can assure noble lords that i have done so <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend lord hylton will gladly accept that from me <e> <s> there have been some fascinating contributions to this debate <e> <s> may i begin by referring to some of the points made by the noble baroness lady denington who as she rightly reminded us together with the noble lord lord greenwood of rossendale has tabled amendment no <e> <s> while the noble lord lord evans of claughton has tabled amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> although they are not exactly the same they are quite similar and cover the same point <e>", "<cs> i was saying very much that <e> <s> i was tempted to speak at some length to these amendments nos <e> <s> and but i feel that in the interests of what the committee would like me to do bearing in mind that these amendments like nos <e> <s> and do cover this whole subject if my noble friend feels able to withdraw them i shall not need to speak at length on them and i would further undertake to take away amendments nos <e> <s> and to consider and <e>", "<cs> i gather that my noble friend is not willing to withdraw his amendment and so i think that i must speak on it either now or later because it <e>", "<cs> would that it were so <e> <s> unfortunately it is very far from the case and i frankly regret very much that my expression of willingness to take this matter away to consider it has been turned down in the way that it has <e> <s> it is the first time since i have been in your lordships house or in committee that i have ever heard that happen <e> <s> i think that it is important that we should <e>", "<cs> there is always the report stage of course but the fact is that if we are to have a discussion on this matter then i must do it this way <e> <s> i should have thought that there was great merit in our having the ability to try to find agreement by mutual understanding rather than by putting it to the vote <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i may have put it wrongly in which case i apologise to my noble friend but i specifically said that if he would withdraw these amendments we would come back on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i also said or meant to say that the areas were very close together and that although there were differences between the amendments nevertheless i <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do again resolve itself into a committee on the bill <e>", "<cs> may i turn first to some of the points made by my noble friend <e> <s> he referred to the observations of the housing centre trust <e> <s> i would only say that they can have their opinions and we can have ours <e> <s> perhaps i should remind my noble friend that there will be no cost yardsticks as soon as the present legislation alterations have gone through this house and the other place the government have changed project control completely <e> <s> he talked about the need to replace those houses sold <e> <s> we seem to have difficulty getting away from the generalities in this series of debates and i suppose that is inevitable <e> <s> i have said before and repeat that i do not accept the premise that you must replace every <e>", "<cs> how many times do i have to repeat that just do not accept the argument at all <e> <s> the fact that a tenant buys and continues to occupy the same house only now as the owner instead of the tenant makes not the slightest difference to the pool of houses <e>", "<cs> it does not make the slightest difference <e> <s> no doubt i shall say so times and be contradicted but i fully expect that and so be it <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has proposed the exclusion from the right to buy of dwellings in a parish or ward within a district councils area where the authority owns less than dwellings <e> <s> these conditions will usually arise only in rural areas and to that extent they are already provided for under clause of the bill <e> <s> that clause allows conditions to be imposed in certain circumstances on the resale of dwellings which have been purchased under the right to buy <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> to listen to the noble lord lord hatch armageddon is about to descend upon us if we do not accept this amendment so i presume it will not come as any real surprise to him to learn that we will not accept the amendment <e> <s> this is the first of several amendments that we shall be considering on the question of the sale of council houses in rural areas <e> <s> most of them relate to clause <e>", "<cs> if people are not in a financial position to buy they will not do so but they have the right to buy and that is what matters <e> <s> that seems to be what is missing in the understanding throughout the whole of this discussion <e> <s> the government undertook to give the right to buy to those who can and that we would help them in any way we could <e> <s> that we shall do <e> <s> if they cannot buy and it is not everybody who can or will want to then that is up to them <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend the duke of norfolk <e> <s> the point which he has made is a fair point <e> <s> today we have kept well away from the financial implications and aspects and i do not want to get involved in them at this time of night unless so pressed <e> <s> however there is a very valid argument as regards this matter which i shall keep for another time <e>", "<cs> i really have much respect for what the noble baroness says and i can only say from the experience that i have had that it has not happened that way <e> <s> time will tell when far greater number are sold <e> <s> as to the points that the noble lord lord stewart of fulham referred to on the financial aspects and the adverse effects he said they would have frankly i just do not take his points at all <e> <s> if anything is conducive to helping the situation it is the policy of selling because the local authorities will be able to retain per cent <e> <s> of the capital receipts and they will be able to apply that per cent <e> <s> and that extra money to their existing hips allocation which they will receive <e> <s> with that they can do whatever they like <e> <s> they can build more houses better repair their existing stock they can do what they like <e> <s> if that is not a positive contribution towards enabling them either to build or to do whatever else they want to do i do not know what is <e> <s> however no doubt we shall come to that in more detail when we come to the financial implications <e>", "<cs> first i must confess that i have not seen the notice that my noble friend has sent to me <e> <s> i do not know exactly what the bill proposes should be the definition of social service <e> <s> of course i know my own understanding of the term <e> <s> it covers a very broad field <e> <s> anyone who has been involved in local government work will know what is meant by social service <e>", "<cs> whether category or category old peoples dwellings are covered by this definition will depend on the circumstances of the individual case <e> <s> there will virtually always be a clear understanding straight away as to whether or not the first two criteria the existence of a group of dwellings and the letting practice of the landlord are met <e> <s> we decided as a matter of conscious policy that it was better to express the third criterion a social service or special facilities in general terms rather than to spell it out in the legislation <e> <s> this provides a flexibility that would be needed if each case is to be treated on its own particular merits <e>", "<cs> if anyone can join in this debate i might be able to say something to respond <e> <s> the noble lord lord sefton has indeed shown a rather tenuous hold on the friendship to which i referred earlier <e> <s> if it is really only that sort of friendship it could not have been much in the first place but i think he was talking with his tongue slightly in his cheek <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend says i did not know of his intention to raise this point and as with the point made by my noble friend lord hylton clearly i should like to come back to him on it <e> <s> it is really not hard to give a view on a matter of this kind to get an interpretation but that is not what my noble friend wants <e> <s> he wants an authoritative and considered response and that i gladly undertake to give him <e> <s> indeed i will make it available also to noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the interesting point <e> <s> i had noticed the case to which my noble friend referred with much interest as i am sure did many <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has explained why he believes that the minimum period for the lease of a flat sold under the right to buy should be years rather than the years provided in the bill as drafted <e> <s> since that was his intention perhaps he should really have sought to amend clause <e>", "<cs> i hear what my noble friend says and of course i will gladly come back to him on the point <e> <s> i really do not feel that it is something we might do anything about but i gladly undertake to discuss it with colleagues and see whether they feel there is something that we ought to be doing <e>", "<cs> some of the points raised by the noble lord lord monson are most interesting not to say fascinating <e> <s> i am sure he does not expect at this time of the night that one would spot what i suspect must be a rather simple explanation of the points that he makes <e> <s> however i readily assure him that of course we shall look at this very carefully indeed with a magnifying glass in order to pick out the answer <e>", "<cs> one would normally expect that the selling price would reflect some of these additional costs and the kind of expense to which the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i would certainly not be able to say that to the noble lord <e> <s> frankly i would think it most unlikely <e> <s> but anything that he says is clearly on record and will go into the pool of thinking on the points that have been made <e>", "<cs> as i said in regard to the previous amendment we would want to look at some of the points which the noble lord lord monson has raised <e> <s> however i think that one must say that he is not correct in his basic assumption that a landlord is required to carry out the functions listed in his amendment at his own expense throughout the term of the lease when a flat is sold under the right to buy <e> <s> even if his interpretation had been correct however his amendment would not have been necessary to ensure that the landlords obligations were taken into account when the grant of a lease of the flat was valued because clause <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has said that the discounts available under clause of the bill when a dwelling is sold under the right to buy are unduly generous <e> <s> i cannot agree <e> <s> they are certainly not ungenerous but they are nevertheless fair both to landlords and to tenants and fairly reflect the relationship in which they stand to each other as seller and buyer <e> <s> when a tenant in the private sector arranges to buy his home from his landlord he does not expect to pay nor does the landlord expect to receive the price that the dwelling would have fetched if it had been sold on the open market with vacant possession <e> <s> the price which is paid takes due account of the realities of the situation and the presence of a sitting tenant with security of tenure <e> <s> there is no reason why those realities should be <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness lady birk has said one could pick up and continue the debates we had the other day <e> <s> i shall try not to do so <e> <s> replying to the point my noble friend lord hylton has made i do not think that <e> <s> in the first place the per cent <e> <s> was in the manifesto and it was always understood that that would be the basic starting point after three years occupancy as a secure tenant <e> <s> i do not think that to go per cent <e> <s> a year thereafter is wrong at all <e>", "<cs> having arrived at the department in only relatively recent times i am not sure what the department thinks of the housing centre trust <e> <s> i have known them for many years and there is no doubt that they have made and i am sure will continue to make an important contribution to the whole of what is being done in housing in this country <e>", "<cs> as to the first point of the survey i cannot quote a specific survey but much research was done into this a long time ago <e> <s> i have no doubt that any check on the percentage difference of the market value of a house with vacant possession as opposed to one with a sitting tenant must fall within the ball-park that we are talking about <e> <s> i cannot quote a specific survey <e>", "<cs> that is not quite so <e> <s> on a house which is sold when subsidy is still on it and that would apply to the great majority of houses the money received is offset against the interest that would have to be paid on the continuing debt <e> <s> the statistics which i shall gladly be quoting at a later stage will indicate that the net effect of on the one hand offsetting what one loses by way of income from rents on dwellings and on the other the continuing cost of maintenance and of paying the interest on the remaining outstanding debt more than offset each other <e> <s> we will get down to the detail of it when we come to it <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if the noble baroness considers that my words are unconvincing <e> <s> they may be to her <e> <s> i sincerely hope they are convicing to many other members of the committee <e>", "<cs> regarding amendment no <e> <s> together with amendments nos <e> <s> and i think really i should like to speak with your lordships permission to all these amendments because i believe i can cover the points raised by my noble friend and perhaps some others as well which may short-circuit some of his queries <e> <s> needless to say if i do not do so i shall be glad to <e>", "<cs> it is not so much a question of being written off or neglected as the degree of practicability <e> <s> i think that this matter was carefully thought through and it was decided that this was the most practical way of dealing with it <e> <s> but just as the noble lord says he will consider what we have put as with everything that he said i hope we will consider any observations he may care to make either now or in any other form <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is much i can add to what i have already said on this but as noble lords in the committee will have gathered we are in a very complex area now <e> <s> i suspect it is going to become even more complex in the next hour or so <e> <s> i would gladly say that there will be a number of matters <e>", "<cs> we believe that this particular form of making this provision is fully justified <e> <s> those serving in the regular armed forces of the crown on or after st december the day after publication of the bill will have the benefit for discount purposes of time spent in accommodation provided in connection with their membership of the armed forces <e> <s> the husband or wife of someone serving on or after that date who subsequently becomes a secure tenant will also be able to count for discount time spent in accommodation provided because he or she was married to a member of the armed forces <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friends and to the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal <e> <s> what she says is quite correct <e> <s> we are merely extending the principle to this new provision <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for the point he makes <e> <s> as he so rightly assumed i am not in a position to answer him now but i do assure him that it will be taken away it is on the record so that we can see whether we can give him some information that might be helpful <e>", "<cs> i shall try to answer the points which my noble friend has raised <e> <s> the intention behind our arrangements for costs under the right to buy is that each side of the transaction should pay its own costs as normally is the case with sales in the private sector <e> <s> the provision in subsection that the mortgage should include those costs legal or otherwise which the vendor either validly charges to the purchaser namely the costs arising from the mortgage or which it initially meets on his behalf is a valuable help for purchasers in meeting all the liabilities they will face on becoming home-owners <e>", "<cs> there are indeed a number of matters that are still being discussed with bodies which are involved and interested <e> <s> i think that it is right that that should be so <e> <s> indeed i am sure that he will be pleased to know that some of the very points still being discussed are ones that have been raised by my noble friend himself and are matters where we have given undertakings that we would be talking about certain aspects <e> <s> i suspect that that will be the case until the very time when we move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will feel that that is encouraging rather than discouraging <e>", "<cs> there are obviously strong arguments for allowing a landlord and indeed the housing corporation though it is not mentioned in this amendment to be able to calculate a purchasers mortgage entitlement in a way which takes proper account of his ability to make his mortgage repayments which in its turn will depend to a considerable extent on his existing commitments <e> <s> this is why the secretary if state said in another place that it was his intention to ensure that normal commercial practice applies under the provisions of clause <e> <s> clause empowers the secretary of state to make regulations determining how the amount of mortgage entitlement is to be calculated <e> <s> that remains our guiding principle in this matter <e> <s> it is our intention that the mortgage to which a purchaser is entitled should be one which he can reasonably afford to repay <e>", "<cs> indeed i do yes <e> <s> i thought that i had said that <e>", "<cs> as i stand at the moment i cannot say exactly when but before the day is out i shall endeavour to give the information to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> let me quickly and i hope briefly put the noble lords fears at an end <e> <s> i can assure him that the right to a mortgage will not put any strain on local authority mortgage loan money <e> <s> when a tenant exercises his right to buy and along with that his right to a mortgage there will be no need for the local authority to raise money to advance to the purchaser <e> <s> after all the local authority already owns the house and is merely handing over that ownership to the tenant <e> <s> on a sale under the right to buy therefore it will <e>", "<cs> i am not clear here as to what the noble lord means <e> <s> if we are talking entirely of a local authority selling to its sitting tenant then the position is as i have already stated and as the noble lord so obviously knows <e> <s> what other body he is referring to i am not sure <e> <s> when a housing association tenant exercises the right to a mortgage possibly that is what the noble lord has in mind the money will come from the housing corporation and not from the local authority <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way for a moment <e> <s> it might be helpful if i made a comment on a point that the noble baroness made a moment ago and that the noble lord just mentioned regarding the regulations <e> <s> i am advised that the regulations cannot be made until the bill is passed and the power to do so becomes available <e>", "<cs> in reply to my noble friend i should like again to touch upon one of the aspects of this matter which may not be very clear <e> <s> the amendment would make two fundamental changes to the right to buy procedure <e> <s> it would mean that local authority landlords no longer had the power to serve completion notices on any tenants who were delaying and it would remove the option procedure from the bill <e> <s> with regard to the service of a completion notice i think it is only reasonable that just as a landlord is required to proceed with his side of a sale as soon as possible the landlord should be able to require a tenant who is delaying to complete within a fixed period of time <e> <s> the other major provision in clause which this amendment would seek to remove is that whereby a tenant who cannot afford to buy straight away may have a -year option to purchase the dwelling-house at the original valuation <e>", "<cs> such people may indeed say that they will wait for two years <e> <s> the motive behind that may be <e>", "<cs> it is not normal i quite agree that in making a purchase you can arrange to have a price that will stay fixed for two years <e> <s> yes that is a very fair point to make but again one would have to look at it in the total context of the whole scene and of what one is doing and what one is seeking to do <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill has suggested that private people should perhaps be given the right to buy in special circumstances and spoke about that hitting the landlords pockets <e> <s> i would have thought that it would have exactly the opposite effect <e> <s> i should think that many landlords would be only too delighted if they were able to sell to people who might be assisted to buy in one way or another but i think that that is really a side issue <e>", "<cs> i do not think we can take it away in the manner that the noble baroness lady birk suggests <e> <s> on the face of it there seems to be no reason to do that <e> <s> having said that i will undertake to look at it and if there is any cause for special concern or if the noble baroness would care to discuss it later with me and anything transpires from that we will deal with it in that way <e>", "<cs> this is probably the third time that we have spoken on this matter in the bill <e> <s> i have tremendous sympathy with the noble baroness in the difficulty of finding a way round the various amendments and so on <e> <s> i do not think that we are going to be able to help her very much here <e> <s> there are one or two points that i ought to make clearer than i may have done before when discussing this whole subject <e> <s> the option procedure is a tightly drawn provision <e> <s> it will only be available in limited circumstances that is where a tenants mortgage entitlement would not enable him to buy immediately <e> <s> i do not think that it has been said before but a prospective purchaser has to be able to show that he cannot buy immediately <e> <s> it is not simply good enough to say i do not want to buy immediately <e>", "<cs> i have always been and i hope i have shown in your lordships house and in committee no less a great lover of compromise where it is possible <e> <s> i hope that i will continue to show that where it is possible <e> <s> i fear however that i do not have the room to manoeuvre in this particular instance <e> <s> i cannot help my noble friend <e>", "<cs> the way in which it will become clear that a purchaser is unable to buy at once is as follows <e> <s> the amount of mortgage entitlement of the purchaser will be calculated under the clause regulation <e> <s> where the amount which emerges turns out to be below the price which he is going to have to pay then and only then will he get his option to complete later <e> <s> otherwise if he wants to complete he must do so as soon as everything is clear <e>", "<cs> may i first say that i hope that noble lords opposite do not consider i am sure that they do not that because one is willing to take something away and have a look at it that that automatically implies that one is dissatisfied <e> <s> it is one of the courtesies of the house to consider something which is raised which it might be useful to do or to see whether there is a case for looking again <e> <s> so although as i said earlier to the noble baroness lady birk it would be helpful to give more information or to give a better explanation which one would always want to be doing it should not be concluded that one was unhappy with the whole of a clause <e>", "<cs> he talked about getting some of his friends into council houses but if he could do that easily he would be destroying his own earlier argument that it is a difficult thing to do <e> <s> but even more important i should have to remind him that even if they were in they would have to wait three years and after that time they might not be so enthusiastic as the noble lord suggested <e>", "<cs> the intention of this subsection is to allow the tenant to delay purchase by up to two years but only where his mortgage entitlement under this chapter is insufficient <e> <s> during that period of two years he may purchase at a price based on the valuation at the relevant time as defined in clause <e> <s> that is the date on which a tenant served notice <e>", "<cs> once the regulations are clearly made and laid down there will be no difficulty <e> <s> everyone will be able to see what they comprise and when a tenant who is applying wishes to get the information it will be made available to him <e> <s> once he knows what it is he can then make the decision <e>", "<cs> no not necessarily <e> <s> if the terms that are laid down in the regulations are ones which he cannot fulfill then he knows what the position is <e> <s> but once they are there for everyone to see it will not be a question of who decides <e> <s> that is what they will be and it is as simple as that <e> <s> in this bill we are trying to make it as clear as possible so that everyone knows his entitlements rights and limitations <e> <s> i readily agree that this is a very complex matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord stewart suggested that we might look to see whether the wording could be made clearer and i said that one should always do that <e> <s> i do not think we can go much further <e>", "<cs> no it is neither the tenant nor the landlord <e> <s> it is the facts as they will be which will decide the issue <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether i would take this away <e> <s> i have already said to the noble lord lord stewart that no i cannot do that <e> <s> but everything that has been said here will be considered very carefully to see whether we can provide greater clarification or improvement <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why these bills come to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i confirm that that is so <e> <s> in those circumstances a tenant cannot exercise the right to buy <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> we had a long and really quite fascinating debate on this <e>", "<cs> when we were dealing with amendment no <e> <s> i think i said then that so far as i was concerned i was also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should like to reiterate one point which i think to some extent at least should assuage the fears of the noble lord lord monson namely that a service charge will be possible on sales and the right to buy <e> <s> in any case the bill provides for the tenants of flats to buy a long lease under the right to buy rather than the freehold and the reason for that is that under the law as it stands long leasehold sales offer the most convenient way of making arrangements for dealing with such matters as the provision of services and obligations to repair <e>", "<cs> this is something on which i will undertake to come back to the noble lord as i will on the point he has raised <e> <s> i think that is probably the best way to deal with it <e>", "<cs> these amendments would considerably reduce the flexibility <e>", "<cs> to the best of my knowledge i think the answer is no <e>", "<cs> i understood that the noble baroness lady fisher was asking whether there would be a difference between the two and it was to that that i said to the best of my knowledge no <e>", "<cs> first i should like to deal with one or two of the points which the noble lord lord evans of claughton made <e> <s> on the one hand he said that the particular people living in many of these areas would not be able to buy <e> <s> then he called for a total ban on sales <e> <s> with respect i do not think that those two statements are consistent <e> <s> if people will not be able to afford to buy why have a ban on selling on the right to buy <e> <s> however i suspect that as always what will happen is that there will be some who will want and some who will not want either because they are not able or because they do not want <e> <s> then i should have to return to the point i made on the first day of the committee stage when i said all right but what we are talking about is a right to buy <e> <s> if they do not buy for any reason then so be it no one is making them buy <e>", "<cs> it would be up to the authority in each case to decide whether or not it wished to make such provision <e> <s> that would be its option if it felt that that was what it should do <e> <s> i would have to come back to say that there would be no need to do so in my view i know it is not a view held by noble lords opposite for the simple reason that a sale had been made because when a sale is made the house just does not disappear at all but if it should be that an authority feels that it ought to build new then of course that is for it to decide <e>", "<cs> it is precisely because there exists in the committee the feeling of which the noble baroness lady birk spoke on this as much as in other areas precisely because representations have been made by people concerned with the matter who put their case in the way they did and precisely because there is concern and agreement about the problems involved that we are introducing amendments to clause which were not there originally <e> <s> when one puts all of this into the context of the whole scene of what the government are seeking to do noble lords should feel satisfied that we have gone all the way down the line to meet the fears which were expressed fears which in my view are no longer what they might have been at one time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendment be now

candidates for inclusion in the right-to-buy scheme for safeguarding rural areas <e> <s> but i trust that on further reflection my noble friend will agree that the automatic application of these safeguards to green belts would not be right <e> <s> the primary purpose of a green belt is to check the spread of an adjoining urban area <e> <s> thus though a green belt may be a rural area the reason for having it differs markedly from the reason for making an area a national park or an area of outstanding natural beauty <e> <s> there the intention is to protect the area itself <e> <s> that is why some tracts of land fall both within areas of outstanding natural beauty and within green belts <e>", "<cs> i fear that on this cannot be as specific as my noble friend would like <e> <s> when looking at this amendment and talking about it we touched on the point that he had just raised as to what might be the basis and so on <e> <s> to be helpful i would say it is something we have talked about <e> <s> i cannot now give him any more information <e> <s> i doubt that i shall be able to be specific but if i can get something that i think would assist him then i undertake to do so but i would ask that he does not hold me to this <e> <s> i will see what might be done <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has made it clear that she considers that where further rural areas are to be designated under clause of the bill it is the local authority which should have the power to make the designation <e> <s> with a view perhaps to modifying her proposal in such a way as to make it acceptable to the government she has proposed that in making its orders the local authority should have the consent of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i did say did i not at the end of my remarks that as it so happens and i said it was right that it should be so orders of this kind will come under the scrutiny of parliament <e> <s> i should have thought that that was about as good a way as any of ensuring that anything that was happening was brought to the notice of all concerned <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i am quite following the point the noble baroness is making <e> <s> if an authority take an initiative there is little doubt that everyone within the area concerned will know that the initiative has been taken <e> <s> it is not for me to tell the noble baroness the various forms that the media use for that sort of purpose <e> <s> these things are always very much a matter of local interest more so these days than ever before i should have thought <e> <s> if further there is to be scrutiny by parliament that again widens it still further <e> <s> i am not at all aware of any possible danger of anyone not knowing what is happening <e> <s> if i am missing a point i will be glad to

have a word with me afterwards unless it is so late that neither of us is in the mood so to do <e> <s> as soon as convenient i will try to ascertain for her that which she needs to know if i am able so to do <e>", "<cs> i am very pleased to hear expressed the concern the noble lord has for the would-be purchaser <e> <s> i have nothing to add to what i have said <e> <s> it is open to an authority who are sufficiently interested or who want to do so to take an initiative with a view to having their area designated in this way that is up to them <e> <s> but the criteria if one likes where there is uncertainty is something which i have already said has yet to be decided <e> <s> the individual areas have not yet been decided and certainly i have no intention of speculating on that at the present time <e>", "<cs> i do not recall saying that a local authority should themselves designate their area <e> <s> if i did i certainly did not mean to do so and i apologise for having said so <e> <s> only the record will show if i said that or not <e> <s> what i thought i had said was that it would be up to an authority to take the initiative of applying to have their area so designated <e> <s> i really do believe that that is what i said but if not then of course i am sorry about that <e>", "<cs> of course you can get a variation but what we are talking about is the designation of a rural area for the purposes of this bill <e> <s> that is really where we are parting company <e> <s> it is no good the noble lord lord ross persisting <e> <s> i cannot make out whether he is concerned about the interests of the landlord the local authority the tenant scotland or anywhere else <e> <s> i cannot tell that at all from what he says <e> <s> what i have said all along and i repeat it now is that if there is uncertainty about this and noble lords want to know more about it then i will gladly undertake as i always do to write and tell them the position as we <e>", "<cs> we have already seen a number of amendments which would run a coach and horses through the governments policy for a countrywide right to buy <e> <s> with that purpose in mind amendments have already been put down to exclude entirely or to place heavy restrictions upon the sale of elderly peoples dwellings of houses in rural areas of houses in areas where the local authority owns less than a certain percentage of the housing stock of housing in inner city areas of housing in housing action areas of housing in housing stress areas of dwellings with more than a certain number of bedrooms and so on <e> <s> these are two more such amendments <e>", "<cs> one can stand here and try to define a rural area but the fact is that i do not know of any definition and i doubt whether there is one <e> <s> in the past people have said that it is an area with a population of less than this or that that is a rural area but clearly we know of places in the heart of urban spots which are authorities of their own and whatever else they may or may not be no one i know would call them rural areas <e> <s> of course i cannot give the kind of specific definition which the noble lord would wish to have <e> <s> i think we can only come back to the point which i made before namely that at the end of the day there are to be designations on the initiatives of one side or the other and within that the effects of clause will apply <e> <s> beyond that i do not know that i can be of help to my noble friend and i fear that i am not able to accept these amendments <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord sandford for what he has just said <e> <s> i seem to be going round and round the same arguments all the time <e> <s> i recognise that what my noble friend lord hylton is seeking is if not the whole of the cake at least part of it if he cannot get the total exclusion at least can he get it to some extent within the pre-emption rights <e> <s> a halfway house i think is what he is seeking <e> <s> i fully understand the point he is making but i would have to answer him properly by going over all the arguments again and again <e> <s> there is the one about the effect that a sale does or does not have on the availability of the pool of dwellings to rent clearly we have a difference between us and so be it <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to extend the pre-emption safeguard in <e>", "<cs> that is not the point <e> <s> we are here talking about the governments intention to give a right to buy with all that flows from that and all we have discussed at length about what a right to buy means <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> before i come to the points that have been raised by noble lords opposite on this amendment i want to repeat an important point which has rightly been stressed by the government throughout the proceedings on this bill in another place <e> <s> it is that the powers of the secretary of state under clause are reserve powers <e> <s> the government hope and believe that local authorities even if they are out of sympathy with the aims of the bill will make every genuine effort to carry out responsibly and conscientiously the statutory duties which it will impose on them <e> <s> if they do so then occasions on which the secretary of states powers under this clause need to be used will rarely if ever arise <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will keep this fact in mind while this clause is under discussion <e>", "<cs> i am not at all convinced at the same time i recognise the point of view being put forward <e> <s> i cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> i do not agree with it and i do not think that it is necessary but i am prepared to do the very thing that the noble lord suggested and talk to my colleagues about it <e> <s> beyond that i cannot go <e> <s> that i will undertake to do <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his comments <e> <s> i am not quite sure as to what i can do to help but i gladly undertake to take this away and see whether it would be helpful and possible to do this <e>", "<cs> the very last point touched upon by my noble friend lord hylton gives the clue to the reason why the government cannot accept these amendments <e> <s> when one starts to bring in one group of people then one wants to bring in another and another and another and the basic objectives of the bill become undermined <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend lady faithfull for having given me notice of the points that she intended to raise <e> <s> the amendment is on a theme which has been much worked over during the past few weeks in the course of proceedings on the bill in another place <e> <s> its purpose is to exclude from security of tenure and hence the right to buy housing which has been acquired by the local authority housing associations or other public sector landlords and is being let temporarily by the <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i explained the reason for the exclusion covering students <e> <s> they are a group of people whose need for housing in a particular place is by its very nature temporary <e> <s> the purpose behind the exclusion is therefore to give a certain degree of flexibility to landlords and at the same time to help students by encouraging public sector landlords to let to them <e>", "<cs> despite the hour i do not feel like a dead horse <e> <s> i appreciate the noble lords intention in seeking to exclude from the tenants charter tenancies granted by industrial key workers housing associations who are providing housing as a means of encouraging employment in assisted areas which is indeed a very valuable function <e> <s> however i believe that the fifth exclusion in schedule namely temporary accommodation for persons seeking employment already caters for such cases <e> <s> under that exclusion people moving to an area for job reasons and needing somewhere to live in the short-term while looking for a permanent house will be excluded from the tenants charter for one year <e> <s> if they are still in occupation at the end of that year they will obtain security under the provisions of the bill <e> <s> i believe that that is right since it will allow landlords flexibility in providing short-term accommodation for newcomers moving for job reasons without creating a second class of tenant who will be permanently without security of tenure <e>", "<cs> your lordships have referred to the discussion of this amendment in another place <e> <s> i have listened to what has been said but i am afraid i can only agree with what my honourable friend said on that occasion <e> <s> he said that this provision is a sensible one <e> <s> it allows a landlord with the leave of the court yes indeed i did pick up the point as the noble lord lord evans suggested i might and i stress the words with the leave of the court to add to or alter the ground for possession specified in the notice which a landlord seeking possession will have to serve on the tenant under clause <e> <s> if this were not possible the landlord would have to go through the process of serving a notice seeking possession a second time thus adding to his workload and risking a delay of the court hearing even when it was clearly right that the court should consider the <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether that is the case <e> <s> i suspect the noble lord may well have a point there and that is why i felt based on what the noble lord lord evans had said before that we <e>", "<cs> the principle behind this amendment is that on the break-up of a family public sector landlords should be able to evict the tenant partner in order to reinstate the other or because the other partner has been rehoused elsewhere <e> <s> i recognise that there is widespread support for the idea that the spouse of a partner with responsibility for dependants should generally be the one to be given preference if occupation of the family home is in dispute <e> <s> however there is a considerable objection to the notion as embodied in this amendment that the landlord should be able to make a decision about this before questions of custody and property have been considered by the appropriate court at the time of divorce or legal separation <e> <s> we have legislation in this country governing the matter of rights to the matrimonial home on divorce and this is extended to secure tenancies by the bill itself <e> <s> i can see no case for giving either local authorities or other public sector landlords the opportunity to make a prior judgment about this in the context of managing their housing stock <e>", "<cs> there has been so much consultation down the line that i cannot tell my noble friend if every single aspect was covered in this way <e> <s> i should be very surprised if it was not but i cannot tell my noble friend precisely that it was <e> <s> i should be surprised if it was not <e>", "<cs> none of us would want to see an elderly person moved from their life-long home against their wishes solely because of under-occupation <e> <s> that is why we have not included in the bill a general ground for possession based on under-occupation <e> <s> to have done so would have been inconsistent with our general aim to give public sector tenants security in the dwelling which is their home <e>", "<cs> the intention of this amendment would be to require that all dwellings to be let on shorthold would have to measure up to a particular standard <e> <s> the government cannot accept this <e> <s> there seems to us to be no reason <e>", "<cs> i am glad to clear up one point namely that in the case of shorthold it is not a matter of their being an existing rent at all <e> <s> a tenant will only go into a shorthold which would be new premises <e> <s> where any tenant at present has a regulated tenancy with all that flows from it the bill says quite clearly that it cannot be switched into shorthold <e> <s> that is an express condition in the bill <e> <s> therefore the matter of it being a new rent does not arise at all because we are starting from scratch with a whole new area of accommodation so switching or increasing rents does not arise <e>", "<cs> i do indeed know what members who sit opposite feel about shortholds and i trust that in turn they know what we on this side feel about them <e> <s> we shall have several opportunities very shortly to debate in depth the basic intentions behind the shorthold proposals <e> <s> for the moment i ought to stick strictly to this amendment <e> <s> it would have the effect of preventing somebody who is already a statutory or protected tenant from being granted a shorthold in the same building or in any other dwelling-house in the same registration area belonging to the same landlord <e> <s> i recognise the concern which has been expressed that existing statutory and protected tenants may be persuaded to sign away their security by agreeing to take shortholds <e> <s> that is why we have specifically provided in subsection of the clause that a shorthold of the same dwelling cannot be granted to an existing statutory or protected tenant <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord hylton for the point <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that i will reproduce this before report stage but what i do undertake is to take it away <e> <s> i believe this is a critical part of what we are proposing <e> <s> i entirely understand that and i gladly assure the noble baroness that if it is at all possible i will try to do it <e> <s> but i cannot give an undertaking so to do <e> <s> if i fail so to do because i cannot then she will have to decide her course of action <e>", "<cs> again i shall resist the temptation to make some of the <e>", "<cs> in moving the amendment noble lords have argued that wherever and whenever a shorthold letting takes place the rent must be one which the rent officer has registered <e> <s> they have suggested that without a registered rent tenants will be subject to excessive pressure <e> <s> in so arguing they have illustrated a tendency in landlord and tenant legislation which your lordships may agree has caused much unnecessary difficulty <e> <s> the tendency of which i am thinking is to legislate for the whole country on a uniform basis in response to a problem which has arisen in pressure areas <e> <s> for example can anyone seriously question that it was something of a disaster to apply full rent act protection to furnished lettings everywhere as was done in when the problem such as it was and is was alleged to be serious only in london and other city areas areas of housing stress <e> <s> the same is true of rents <e> <s> in many places landlord and tenant would probably be happy to agree rents between themselves without the need for statutory intervention <e>", "<cs> of course i readily agree that we should do precisely what my noble friend says <e> <s> i am grateful to him for the way he put it <e> <s> as i think i indicated before how could i be on certain ground when a constitutional point is raised by noble lords of experience and knowledge <e> <s> clearly one would have to look at it <e> <s> the suggestion that my noble friend makes that possibly the affirmative order procedure might be better could indeed be an answer <e> <s> i cannot say and i know he does not expect me to say at this moment that that is so <e> <s> i cannot make a commitment but i think the point is valid that we should look at it <e> <s> i think also that the power to the secretary of state would be a far-reaching one and involve an important matter <e> <s> therefore i have no hesitation in saying yes of course we will do precisely that <e>", "<cs> i do not want to drag out this matter we have so much ahead of us but on that latter point i should have to say that of course we will look at it but i am very doubtful whether the secretary of state would want to lay down such rigid lines <e> <s> it would take away from him any flexibility whatsoever <e> <s> indeed the point i made earlier was that one of the matters that have so bedevilled housing above all other things in this country has been some of the attempts to legislate nationally for situations which differ so much locally <e> <s> having said that i would add that of course if we are looking at this matter we shall look at everything that is said on it <e>", "<cs> this series of amendments would severely restrict in a way we could not accept the circumstances in which shorthold could be used <e> <s> their effect would be that a landlord could be sure of letting any particular dwelling on shorthold once only and that he could not let on shorthold at all any dwelling he might want to let again whether on shorthold or for that matter on any other type of tenancy at some time in the future <e> <s> that would be quite unacceptably restrictive <e> <s> the governments view is that shortholds should be widely available to encourage landlords to go on letting and to make more accommodation available <e> <s> that is the whole object of the exercise <e>", "<cs> i am deeply grateful to everyone who has spoken on this <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady birk has said this clause really is the fundamental part of this whole matter and i am glad that we can talk right across the whole spectrum of it <e> <s> there are a few facts that i should state and i shall try to do so as quickly as i can but i do feel obliged to try to cover the points that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords if someone wants to move who is currently a regulated tenant first of all he will surely take into account the security that he has if he stays where he is <e> <s> if he wishes to go into the open market for something else i would presume that with the security he already has he would make quite certain that he did not do so until he had found something that was an alternative <e> <s> if the suggestion is that the shorthold provision that we are proposing will make it more difficult for him so to do i respectfully suggest that the noble lord does not follow the arguments that i am trying to make <e> <s> i believe very deeply that there will be so much more such accommodation available <e> <s> it will be up to the tenant who has the security at the present time to decide if that is or is not in his best interests <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness allow me to intervene <e> <s> with great respect that is not correct <e> <s> the tenant will not he able to he evicted within one year <e> <s> he will not be able to be evicted during a period of less than the term for which he has signed the agreement for the shorthold which can be up to five years <e> <s> there is no way in which he can be evicted within one year <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i did not earlier touch on all the points that have been raised and i apologise to noble lords for that <e> <s> one point was that made by the noble lord lord goodman <e> <s> in his suggestion about hardship i thought he was referring in the main to the position as it is in the existing rent acts <e> <s> it is a very interesting one to me <e> <s> i gladly assure him and i am sure that even noble lords opposite will confirm to him that whenever i say that we will take something away and have a look to see whether <e>", "<cs> i think i detected in the observations of the noble lord lord gifford something of a <e>", "<cs> i will try to answer the noble lord <e> <s> strictly speaking it is not the subject of the amendment at all and indeed many of the points raised by the noble lord are more apposite for discussion under the rent acts of <e> <s> nevertheless i will gladly try because he put it so well to me <e> <s> your lordships will excuse me if i try to do it quickly in order to cover the points which the noble lord made <e>", "<cs> may i say that i do not at all accept the point that if the tenant under a shorthold starts to take proceedings or makes attempts to do anything at all about the rent the shorthold tenancy will be brought to an end <e> <s> i entirely fail to see that <e> <s> the position is no different from that under the rent acts <e> <s> on the contrary the safeguard is even greater under the shorthold proposals for two reasons <e>", "<cs> i listened closely to what has been said and would say that the government are in full agreement with the principle that a tenant should not be disadvantaged under the homelessness legislation merely because he has taken a shorthold and the shorthold has come to an end <e> <s> we do not however think that there is a real problem here <e> <s> under existing legislation there are various types of letting where the tenant does not have permanent security of tenure <e> <s> for example tenants in houses let by absent owner-occupiers or by people pending their retirement can be made to leave under the mandatory grounds for possession in the rent acts <e> <s> tenants of resident landlords only enjoy limited security of tenure and the occupants of tied cottages and lodgers have even less security <e>", "<cs> clearly i could attempt to give an answer to the points that have been raised as i understand them but i would far rather ensure that the answers were authoritative and absolutely accurate <e> <s> so i thank the noble lord for his suggestion and i certainly take it up <e>", "<cs> these amendments relate to the governments proposals under clauses to to allow landlords approved by the secretary of state to build for rent outside the rent acts <e> <s> this assured tenancy scheme is a strictly controlled experiment designed to test the possibility of attracting new investment into private renting <e> <s> the main sorts of body we have in mind for approval under the scheme are building societies pension funds and insurance companies or housing associations backed by such bodies <e> <s> but that of course is not to exclude other bodies if they are considered suitable <e> <s> as we are speaking of an experiment we shall monitor it carefully <e> <s> i should stress that clauses are concerned only with new build and hence will have no implications for existing tenancies <e>", "<cs> this amendment would delete the new provisions in clause relating to the period before a new fair rent can be registered and to the phasing of increases in fair rents <e> <s> these are important measures which bring the present rent registration system into line with current circumstances <e> <s> i should have thought that those were the operative words <e> <s> i shall deal first with the provisions relating to the minimum period before a new fair rent can be registered <e> <s> at present once a rent has been registered it remains the rent limit for three years <e> <s> this period was introduced in when the fair rent system came into being and when the annual rate of inflation was only about per cent <e> <s> by reducing this period to two years clause seeks to ensure that the real value of the registered rent does not fall due to the present higher inflation rates as rapidly as it does now under the three year registration period <e>", "<cs> the point is that what the rent will become in due course the new rent that it will lead to will be a matter for determination by the rent officer <e> <s> what we are talking about is the impact of inflation upon the rent which has been fixed for the time until the next registration <e> <s> it is that that i was trying to give examples about when i was referring to it before <e> <s> i think that that is what he wanted to be sure about <e>", "<cs> i have every confidence that the governments intentions <e>", "<cs> with respect the noble lord is talking of a separate category altogether <e> <s> we are talking about rents which are applied under the rent acts where the determination of the new rent is fixed by the rent officer and the basis the rent officer uses to do that is the formula we discussed earlier which i am sure noble lords would not wish me to go over again <e> <s> the point which the noble lord lord janner is so troubled about and which understandably he raises regularly in your lordships house is rather different and with respect does not come within the context of the amendment now before the committee <e> <s> i am sure that will not prevent the noble lord from raising it <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble baroness to permit me to intervene to correct a point she raised earlier <e> <s> i am sure she would like me to put the record right because her figures were wrong <e> <s> she probably gave figures for furnished lettings <e> <s> the average rent registered for unfurnished lettings in london in was or per week <e> <s> in england and wales the figure was or per week <e> <s> the noble baroness gave percentage increases on the previous year but those were misconceived because when rents are re-registered they are increased on a rent registered at least three years before and the average increase on re-registration after three to four years in was in fact per cent <e>", "<cs> the amendment would delete subsection of clause which ensures that the new -year period before fair rents may be reviewed applies only to rents registered after commencement of the bill <e> <s> the -year period would therefore apply also to existing registrations <e> <s> i do not think it reasonable that we should change the rules in mid-stream in the manner proposed by the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> tenants with existing rent registrations will not be expecting another change in the registered rent except through phasing until three years are up <e> <s> they will probably have received notices of increase covering the whole period <e> <s> if at the very moment that they were about to start paying the full fair rent under the existing registration a further increase were to be imposed from a new registration this would cause confusion not to say concern <e>", "<cs> i say to the noble lord lord monson i hear what you say <e> <s> the bill provides for the period of delay to be one year which means that fair rents will be phased in two instalments with the second instalment being due one year after registration <e> <s> we believe that this is right for present circumstances but would not necessarily be so in future <e> <s> in particular it might be necessary to amend the period if the minimum period between registration was amended as is also possible by order under clause <e>", "<cs> i cannot remember the figures but in an answer to a question recently i gave some examples or if i did not give them they were in the brief that i had <e> <s> they were very impressive as to the level at which allowances start to bite <e> <s> the best thing that i can do is to write to my noble friend with that information <e> <s> if noble lords opposite would like to have the same then i think i should do that too <e> <s> i felt that they were very impressive and i should like everyone to know clearly what they are <e> <s> if anything is to be raised following that then it will be done <e>", "<cs> clause seeks to remove the confusion that has been caused by the present provisions relating to the date from which a fair rent takes effect and the date from which the minimum period before re-registration is calculated <e> <s> this amendment would by omitting subsection of clause of the bill restore this confusion and the inequity that goes with it <e> <s> the present provisions relating to the date on which the new rent takes effect are unfairly biased against the landlord <e> <s> if the registration results in a rent reduction the reduced rent is effective from the date of the application to the rent officer and hence the reduction is back-dated <e> <s> if however the new fair rent represents an increase the increased rent although theoretically effective from the date of application can be recovered only from the date of registration and then only if the landlord serves the correct notice on the tenant <e> <s> this amendment will perpetuate that system <e>", "<cs> i have to be very careful in what i say over these things as i have learnt <e> <s> i would only go so far as to say that some of the points that have been made particularly by the noble lord and the noble lord lord evans were interesting ones <e> <s> i undertake that we will look at everything that has been said and should points prove to have merit because i repeat again that we want to get the best bill we can then of course we will do something about it <e> <s> beyond that i feel i cannot go <e>", "<cs> the effect of amendments nos <e> <s> a and b is to add a further restriction to the circumstances in which a landlord can apply to the rent officer for cancellation of a fair rent <e> <s> clause provides that where the rent was registered more than two years earlier where there is no current regulated tenancy in the dwelling the landlord can have the old rent cancelled <e> <s> the amendments alter the second condition <e> <s> instead of no regulated tenancy in the dwelling the proposal is that a rent can be cancelled only if no one other than an owner-occupier is living there <e> <s> the purpose presumably is to ensure that someone who is letting a property outside the rent act in some way cannot at the same time <e>", "<cs> i can only say as i tried to do on the last amendment that if we are not careful we shall indeed in an attempt to avoid dividing the committee if that is what is decided be building up for ourselves at report stage a situation that will be absolutely impossible <e> <s> i have no intention from where i am of doing that <e> <s> i would only repeat and if i did not make it clear earlier i now say it again that where points have been raised that are considered to be important i assure noble lords that everything that is said is sifted carefully where points are raised which in the governments opinion are valid in the sense that they have not been considered or they raise new matter which we ought properly to be doing something about i give the assurance that they will be looked at very closely <e> <s> i cannot say that that is the same as saying we will withdraw or we will consider formally <e> <s> i cannot do that but i can say of course that everything is sifted in detail <e>", "<cs> may i begin by saying that clause removes what is probably one of the biggest iniquities in all the rent acts namely the continued existence of these controlled tenancies with rents still basically fixed at levels <e> <s> they average between and per week <e>", "<cs> i am advised that paragraph of the financial memorandum to the bill puts the cost of the extra work to the rent officer service as being million <e> <s> if the noble lord lord mishcon would like me to do so i will gladly undertake to send him as i propose to do with the noble lord

think it is extremely out <e>", "<cs> i think i must say first of all that one should not be talking about the difference between million and million <e> <s> the noble lord lord goodman said that maybe it would cost <e> <s> he did not say it would cost <e> <s> i am sure he has not done any calculations to enable him to assume it would be so <e> <s> i said the extra cost of the measures could be million and this is still the figure <e> <s> there will be a very great increase in the procedures <e> <s> yesterday when the noble lord lord goodman was talking generally about the rent officer service i said there had been considerable discussions with the institute of rent officers as a result of which whole new procedures are about to be introduced <e> <s> i understand these are entirely with their approbation and i hope may say their enthusiasm <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can briefly comment on one or two of the observations made because we have spent a long time on this clause and there is so much to do <e> <s> i will comment briefly before the noble lord himself winds up <e> <s> the points made by the noble lord lord evans i really cannot possibly accept at all <e> <s> he talks about the fact that the tenants themselves have done repairs <e> <s> my hat <e> <s> if i were a landlord receiving a week how could i get the money to do the repairs especially if i were in the category of the people i have described who really do not have resources <e> <s> with a week coming in and with premises to maintain how on earth could i afford to do the repairs <e> <s> the fact is that they cannot afford to do the repairs <e> <s> this is not something that has just happened in the last few years it has been going on for a long time now and i mentioned a committee which nine years ago said that all of these tenancies should come out of this form of control <e> <s> this is not something that has just taken place <e>", "<cs> i should like to deal with amendment no <e> <s> first <e> <s> it relates to the first of three proposed new clauses designed to close rent act loopholes <e> <s> this one is concerned with the problem of so-called bogus holiday lets <e> <s> of course i do not condone attempts to evade the provisions of the rent acts by pretending that a letting is for a holiday when it clearly is not nor as i understand it do the courts <e> <s> but i think that the main reason that some landlords have resorted to devices of this kind is that the terms of the existing legislation have discouraged them from letting on fully protected tenancies <e> <s> heaven knows <e> <s> one does not condone attempts to evade the provisions but it does no harm to look at some of the causes behind these matters <e>", "<cs> i think that what the noble lord suggests has merit <e> <s> whether that is the best way to go about it i do not know <e> <s> i still feel that what i said about the holiday let is absolutely right by itself <e> <s> as to whether there is more which goes beyond that which i think is what the noble lord lord gifford is saying i think he is entitled to argue in the light of his considerable experience in this field <e> <s> i would say to him just what i said yesterday and it seems so long ago that i think we should study very carefully what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i will speak to those who should be expert in these matters and if it is felt that it would be helpful to act as the noble lord suggests then of course we will do so because i say again and will go on saying until the end of this thing that we want the best bill we can get <e>", "<cs> i need hardly say that noble lords on all sides of the committee are very much pushing at an open door with this amendment <e> <s> i have great sympathy with it and what noble lords have said about it <e> <s> service in the armed forces of the crown imposes very special obligations on people <e> <s> the government accept that there may be a case for singling out servicemen serving overseas who may have particular difficulties in obtaining a house of their own in the way that this new clause proposes <e>", "<cs> unless the noble lord lord evans presses me to do so i will not go into the arguments on the detailed individual conditions in the order that he enumerated them <e> <s> none of the changes we are proposing represent a fundamental change of principle <e> <s> they are all designed to prevent a landlord or his successors from being penalised by a change or circumstances that could not have been foreseen at the time the letting was made <e> <s> none of them will remove from the tenant any security he would have expected at the start of the letting because in none of these cases would the changes we are proposing enable the landlord or his successors to regain possession from the tenant any earlier than the original contract made between the landlord and the tenant would have allowed <e>", "<cs> these amendments are designed to reverse the changes to <e>", "<cs> yes that is the position as i understand it <e> <s> i am glad i that the noble baroness <e> <s> lady birk said <e>", "<cs> i fully acknowledge that the problem which this amendment is designed to solve is a very real one <e> <s> it is also a very difficult one to solve as the relevant provisions in the rent acts are extremely complex <e> <s> as professor prichard has pointed out in the article in the <e>", "<cs> this amendment is designed to limit the amount of any deposit which a landlord may charge as a condition of granting a tenancy to one months rent <e> <s> the purpose of clause is to make clear that the common and perfectly acceptable practice of landlords <e>", "<cs> this amendment would give to rent officers an additional responsibility <e> <s> it would require them to hold deposits that landlords had charged in accordance with clause on behalf of landlords <e> <s> it would also require the rent officer to return such deposits with interest to tenants at the end of the tenancy <e> <s> i do not regard this as an acceptable extension of the role of the rent officer <e> <s> the function of the rent officer is to assess fair rents in accordance with the statutory provisions <e> <s> it is no part of his function to hold deposits on behalf of landlords <e> <s> nor is the rent officer in <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord evans will agree in putting forward this amendment that it has a similar intention to clause as it stands <e> <s> it is concerned to ensure that landlords may charge deposits as security against unpaid bills or damage <e> <s> it would change the clause in three ways <e> <s> first it would spell out precisely what a deposit could be charged for <e> <s> i must tell the noble lord that i do not regard this as necessary as it seems to me undesirable that the clause should seek to anticipate all the items for which a landlord might quite reasonably seek to charge a deposit <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord monson has referred to the difficulties of landlords especially local authorities who have to carry out minor repairs <e> <s> but we should also be concerned about the effect on many tenants on low incomes <e> <s> they may find the cost of a repair job very difficult to bear especially if they are unemployed or elderly <e> <s> and let us remember that such groups tend to be over-represented among council tenants and they are the least able to tackle such jobs themselves <e> <s> i think this amendment could cause many old people a great deal of worry <e> <s> on the other hand i am well aware that as a recent survey bore out many tenants who are perfectly capable of doing minor repairs themselves already do so <e> <s> this seems to me to be entirely sensible and in itself casts doubt on the need for the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very seized of this particular point because it is something with which i was for many years involved at great length <e> <s> i am very pleased to note that in fact there is an obvious increase in the extent to which tenants are doing minor repairs themselves <e> <s> i think so long as it is nothing that is fundamental to the house that could lead to the kind of problem i mentioned a moment ago there must be much merit in it <e> <s> often they do not want to wait anyhow and are only too glad to get the job done and do it the easiest way <e>", "<cs> i do not know that i am able to help the noble lord on this <e>", "<cs> i regard this as an important clause in the bill <e> <s> its purpose <e>", "<cs> as i said right at the very beginning i will gladly send some detailed clarification on this particular amendment to the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> i will see that that is done very quickly <e>", "<cs> then the difficulty is that i do not know what you do not know that you do not know about and that presents yet another problem for me too with the best will in the world <e>", "<cs> i am not in a position to offer formal consultations at a stated time about the content of the new general consent which will be issued under the revised part v of the act <e> <s> however i can tell your lordships that it is the intention that sales on comparable terms to those set out in chapter of the bill should be submitted on a voluntary basis <e> <s> the consent will also extend to sales on share-ownership terms and to building for sale <e> <s> i am also glad to say that there has been contact at official level about the provisions in clauses and <e> <s> also in response to a letter an invitation has been extended to the adc to take up any points they wish with the departments <e> <s> officials would also hope to do that with officers of the other local government associations <e>", "<cs> may i begin by saying to the noble baroness lady fisher that experience has shown that somewhere between and per cent <e> <s> of all sales of council houses are financed privately by the people who buy them <e> <s> the balance comes from mortgages given by the local authority <e> <s> as to her point that there is no enthusiasm by building societies and that no building society has come out and expressed great enthusiasm i can only tell her from my own personal experience that there was in the past no problem at all in getting local building societies in the area from where i come to become involved <e>", "<cs> may i put right one or two of the points which the noble baroness has just made <e> <s> first the government by no means say what an authority should do with the per cent <e> <s> that it will keep <e> <s> a local authority may use it to supplement its housing programme in any way it likes by spending the money on repairs or improvements or on building new houses or whatever <e> <s> but if a local authority wishes not to spend the money on housing that will be its prerogative <e> <s> it will be able to apply its own capital receipts as it wishes <e>", "<cs> i must give an exposition of the financial implications <e> <s> first the notes on clauses which i have seen on this such as they are would serve only to confuse still further <e> <s> there is <e>", "<cs> i think i should first of all put the record straight by pointing out that i did not say that the reason the notes on clauses were not given was because they would be confusing <e> <s> what i said was that i thought that such of the notes on clauses as i had seen would be confusing which is really not the same thing <e>", "<cs> i do not think the noble lord should put words into my mouth or say i said things i did not say <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to draw those conclusions then of course he is entitled to do so but i did not say it <e> <s> it is up to the noble lord to take it any way he likes <e>", "<cs> speaking for myself i rarely believe that it is right to write into legislation a requirement for consultation <e> <s> we have had a number of debates in a number of different spheres on this and i am not in favour of it because in practice it can mean what people want to make it mean and it leads to all sorts of confusions and irritations <e> <s> consultation is something that people want to do and that they should agree to do but they should not be bound to do it because once they are so <e>", "<cs> i was somewhat puzzled when amendment no <e> <s> a was first tabled but now with the adjustment that has been made i will say that what this means is the exchequer counting for subsidy the amount of discount allowed to the purchaser <e> <s> there is in my opinion no justification for this unless the discount creates a loss when as i have said on amendments nos <e> <s> and the loss will count for subsidy <e>", "<cs> it sounds all very right and proper until we start to look at from where the money came to build the house in the first place <e> <s> we cannot get away from the fact that the subsidy came from the exchequer <e> <s> it is not good enough simply to say that it is the authoritys house <e> <s> my hat <e> <s> if it is still paying off as it almost certainly will be because funding is over a -year period then to whom is it paying off <e> <s> it is paying off to where the subsidy came from in the first place <e> <s> no i do not accept the noble lords basic argument and i am sorry that i cannot help him <e>", "<cs> as one of the very newest members of your lordships house what has impressed me so much since i have been here is the fact that not only did everybody tell me that the people here were kind and considerate which i have found to be absolutely true but that the standard of debate was of the highest order which i have also found to be the case <e> <s> i was also told that the courtesies were in the main extremely generous all round and that i have also found to be the case <e> <s> the other arena from which one may come and from which i come is much more vigorous in the sense that the interjection the heckle aloud and the interruption are part of the day-to-day routine <e> <s> one has to go only a little way to the other place to <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first deal with one or two of the points which the noble baroness lady fisher raised <e> <s> she made much of the necessity for taking local circumstances into account when reckonable expenditure is considered <e> <s> i do not know what basis she would have a government take when she talks of fixing subsidies <e> <s> she talks about realistic figures <e> <s> what may be realistic to the authority may not be realistic to others <e> <s> this would be a question of a judgement at the end of the day and it would be hardly surprising would it if in fact an authority felt that its figures were not too low whereas a secretary of state may consider quite differently <e>", "<cs> i did indeed understand the motives of the noble lord lord pitt and i respect what he seeks to achieve <e> <s> the problem is the one that i mentioned before that it is a difference of view about consultation <e> <s> a general determination of reckonable expenditure will encompass both large issues of principle over what expenditure is to rank for subsidy and points of intricate detail <e> <s> we intend to issue very shortly further consultation proposals on a number of aspects of reckonable expenditure <e> <s> i have every reason to believe that this consultation will be full and mutually beneficial <e>", "<cs> a few moments ago we had quite an extensive debate with the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal on this matter and i think that we covered at least the philosophies behind the amendment which the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead has moved <e> <s> i do not know whether there is a great deal more that i can add without going into the kind of detail which i suspect he would not wish me to do <e>", "<cs> i cannot so confirm <e> <s> i doubt very much that it is the intention that it should be done in that way <e> <s> probably i do not surprise the noble baroness too much by saying that but certainly i have had no intimation from any source that that is the procedural way in which we should propose to operate <e> <s> therefore i really cannot hold out too much hope to the noble baroness on this point <e> <s> but i would repeat what i have said so many times <e> <s> i know it is something that does concern the adc <e> <s> i am not sure of the extent to which it has been discussed in the past i have not been privy to those discussions but it may be that not necessarily that procedure but some other procedural <e>", "<cs> i was sorry that among the honours list of local authority experience my noble friend referred to he did not include my own <e>", "<cs> this amendment undermines the whole purpose of clause <e> <s> it will enable a local authority to charge a lower rate of interest on its mortgage lending than it needs to do to cover its costs <e> <s> this means a subsidy to one group of borrowers from other ratepayers which cannot be justified <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness referred to the fact that it seemed like days ago or weeks ago since we started <e> <s> to me it seems like years ago <e>", "<cs> perhaps not quite so briefly but briefly i hope i think the amendment is not necessary <e> <s> subsection already permits a sufficient measure of flexibilty to local authorities when adjusting their rates as a result of either a change in the standard national rate or indeed the local average rate <e> <s> notice of <e>", "<cs> in speaking to this amendment may i also speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the deletion of the six-monthly periods as proposed in these amendments would leave local authorities free to decide when and how often they should determine and declare the applicable local average rate <e> <s> it could enable local authorities to charge interest at a rate which did not cover their costs by failing to declare a local average rate which is up-to-date <e> <s> this would mean a subsidy from the ratepayers which would be unacceptable <e>", "<cs> i wish to say at the outset that i consider that this is very much the right place for this amendment and that will probably please the noble lord lord banks greatly in that having read carefully as i did the previous debate and all that surrounded it it is clear that he seemed to be bedevilled by the fact that everyone was urging and had done on other occasions that it should be proposed in various other places <e> <s> i readily accept that this is where it should be <e> <s> i assure him also that i will talk to the amendment on its merits and do only that <e>", "<cs> without referring to the notes i have here because i think the <e>", "<cs> in replying to this amendment i hope it will be helpful to noble lords if i also take the points raised in amendments nos <e> <s> to since these are all closely connected and concern the worries of noble lords about the grant redemption funds and the way in which they will operate <e> <s> i hope too that i shall be forgiven if i range a <e>", "<cs> may i make two or three brief points <e> <s> on the point the noble baroness lady denington made i am not quite sure of its implications but i shall certainly talk to colleagues about that <e> <s> we will consider the point my noble friend lady faithfull made about small hostels and the administrative difficulties in making the order we will certainly give that some thought <e> <s> as to the point of my noble friend lord hylton i assure him we will look sympathetically at the cases to which surpluses may be applied <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord kinnoull because he made the point i was about to make <e> <s> the government will be studying the question of reserve funds set aside for future expenditure <e> <s> this is an extremely complex area and any proposals would have to be very carefully worked out <e> <s> we are not unsympathetic to the idea underlying the amendment but as drafted and my noble friend said exactly what i would have said it would not be of any practical effect <e> <s> however as i say we are not unsympathetic to it and if the noble lord will withdraw it then it is something we think should be looked at in any case <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and i am sure that what he says is most relevant <e> <s> i promise that we shall look most carefully at his remarks <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> a seeks to ensure that the provisions in this schedule will override any term to the contrary contained in a lease or tenancy agreement <e> <s> i can assure the noble earl that it is quite unnecessary to make specific provision for this <e> <s> it will not be possible to evade the schedule by placing any clause to that effect in a lease or other agreement <e>", "<cs> of course i know the concern <e> <s> if i had not known it it has been raised in your lordships house sufficiently not least by the noble lord lord janner on one aspect of it although it is not strictly speaking so much the service charge aspect that he always raises <e> <s> nevertheless the whole area of mansion blocks is one of concern <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord strabolgi for putting down these amendments which i will try to answer in the kind of detail which i think they merit and for dealing with them in the way he is doing which is most helpful <e> <s> i think that i ought to answer them in some detail <e>", "<cs> i cannot give details of the discussions and consultations which took place <e> <s> i hope that we had them with the professional people to whom my noble friend refers <e> <s> if he has any suggestions to make about that we shall be glad to hear of them <e> <s> other than that have nothing to add <e>", "<cs> i presume the intention of this amendment is to enable a <e>", "<cs> indeed yes but i do not think it would be realistic to expect the court to make a declaration of what will or will not be reasonable in the future <e> <s> i have already explained to your lordships that government amendment no <e> <s> will enable tenants to challenge the reasonableness of demands for advance payments and i think that is a practical way of dealing with this question <e> <s> i really have nothing more that i can add in reply to the noble earl but i should like to say what i said to him on the last amendment that he moved i cannot see at the moment that we can be more helpful on the point but we will look at what he has said and i will consult with my colleagues and if i feel that we ought to be doing something about the matter along the lines that he has suggested i will take steps so to do <e> <s> otherwise i fear i cannot be helpful on this occasion <e>", "<cs> we have already debated the governments amendments - to clause and schedule <e> <s> these fulfil our commitment to give fixed fair rent tenants the opportunity to challenge the evidence on service costs deployed by their landlords before the rent officer <e> <s> the rent officer in fixing a fair rent would anyway only take account of service costs which he considered to be reasonable <e> <s> but our amendments give an added safeguard to the tenant <e> <s> i would suggest to the noble lord that this is a somewhat better approach than that in his amendment because it places the safeguard in the right place <e> <s> fixed fair rent tenants can only have their rent increased by the rent officer and it is at that point we are providing them with the right to challenge the landlords evidence <e>", "<cs> how nice it is to be able to say yes we do entirely agree <e>", "<cs> amendment would amend the provisions in schedule relating to recognition of tenants associations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> on the face of it this seems a reasonable suggestion but the difficulty is that if reductions of rateable value were allowed to count it would be inequitable if corrections upwards were not also allowed to count <e> <s> it would tempt landlords of houses just inside the limits to apply for corrections intended to take them outside the act and thus would give rise to considerable anxiety on the part of the leaseholders concerned <e> <s> there would also be the question of what to do about completed transactions and cases in the pipeline <e> <s> we do not know how many leaseholders have been excluded from the act as a result of incorrect rating valuations but it seems unlikely to be many <e> <s> on the other hand a similar number may <e>", "<cs> i tried to say that if there was a way in which we could be helpful without causing difficulty we should want to do that <e> <s> yes we shall have a look at this <e> <s> may i point out in answer to the noble lord lord davies of leek that the amendment is not of any signifi <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to those who have spoken very briefly and yet i think very effectively on this matter <e> <s> especially am i grateful to my noble friend lord kinnoull for the specialised observations which he makes <e> <s> they are always such a help in this complex area <e> <s> the act was and is intended to help genuine owner-occupiers of leasehold houses and the government felt that this objective could be adequately served by a three-year requirement which as i think the noble lord has acknowledged was amended in another place <e> <s> we do not feel it would be justified to reduce the period to one year and i feel therefore that we cannot accept that so far as amendment no <e> <s> is concerned <e>", "<cs> the leasehold reform act provides that a person who is qualified under the act and serves a notice of his intention to enfranchise may sell the house with the benefit of that notice <e> <s> there is no restriction on to whom he sells it and the purchaser then completes the process of buying the freehold from the landlord under the terms of the act <e> <s> it follows therefore that there is no need with respect for this amendment since its objective can to all intents and purposes be achieved already albeit in two stages <e>", "<cs> amendment would delete the provision in paragraph of schedule to the bill which closes a loophole in the leasehold reform act <e> <s> in so doing it will reopen the loophole and will thereby permit landlords to evade the provisions of the act by granting life leases of a certain kind which are at present exempt <e> <s> government amendment will modify the proposal in the bill by permitting the granting of <e>", "<cs> the intention of amendment seems to be to go further than the governments original proposal in paragraph of the schedule to close a loophole in the leasehold reform act by making the proposal operate retrospectively <e> <s> that is to say the result would be that all life leases which are at present exempt from the act would become enfranchisable whether they were entered into as <e>", "<cs> dare i say that we sometimes refer to certain guides as idiots guides <e> <s> i dare not say that and nor do i mean it in any context other than one within our department sometimes we have idiots guides for ministers <e> <s> i entirely take the point <e> <s> i am not aware of the problems that the schedules or whatever present to people <e> <s> if there is a need as has been so forcefully and fairly suggested certainly we should look at it <e> <s> i undertake that we shall do so and similarly with those parts referred to by the noble lord lord strabolgi <e>", "<cs> of course it is true that i said the noble lord is emotive on this subject but there is nothing wrong with being emotive on it <e> <s> indeed the whole subject of housing is an emotive one <e> <s> it is bound to be <e> <s> it concerns the lives of people because housing is so basic to everything in the country <e> <s> i was rather pleased to hear the noble lord lord strabolgi it would not have helped him if i had called him my noble friend say that the country is divided between those who own property and those who do not <e> <s> of course he is quite right <e> <s> that is the very reason why we are so desperately keen to see that tens and hundreds of thousands maybe millions of council tenants also become owner-occupiers and join those who own their properties <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord differs from me as to that <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene i also have been wondering that same thing for the last few minutes <e>", "<cs> i am not worried about it i should just like to know which amendment it is <e>", "<cs> i do indeed understand the point that noble lords opposite are driving at <e> <s> i understood it on the last amendment when we had a lengthy debate on it and i have to say that i do not become more impressed when the same points are repeated and thrown at me over and over again <e> <s> i like to think that i am as tolerant as anyone but i find it frustrating to have the same points put to me almost <e>", "<cs> i am not going into this argument again <e> <s> we had it yesterday at some length and i said at that time that i would produce and the department has produced evidence which shows that that is not a fact <e> <s> there is nothing in the experience of what has happened that shows it to be a fact <e> <s> in fact it is total rubbish and i do not care what source the noble lord quoted <e> <s> he cannot come along at this point in time when he had the opportunity yesterday when the matter was being debated at length and now throw out figures which have no validity at all <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend for making certainly one of the points i had intended to make myself in response to lord evans <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has said this amendment is in two parts <e> <s> the first part would provide that where there was a chain of leases between the occupying leaseholder and the freeholder on enfranchisement the leaseholder would not pay more in total to purchase several interests than he would if there were only one <e> <s> this is what would normally happen in practice however because the value of each interest will be reduced by virtue of the existence of the leases below <e> <s> the advice i have received therefore is that the provision in the first part of the amendment is not necessary <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and of course what she says is a matter of concern <e> <s> she can be comforted by the fact that our proposals will make some improvement on the present situation <e> <s> i fear there will be a tendency for there to be a worsening it seems to have gone on in that way for so long however much one strives to make it better <e> <s> it is sometimes like trying to push back the sea <e> <s> nevertheless we must try to improve matters and i am grateful for her remarks <e>", "<cs> in examining this amendment we are considering what should be the duty of local authorities who consider that an hmo is not up to standard in some way or another and cannot be made so at reasonable expense <e> <s> quite apart from the vexed question of definition of reasonable expense i should like to make the general point that our purpose must be to keep these houses open closure or reduction of occupation must be regarded as a last resort <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i do not know of the report that the noble lord mentions <e> <s> i understood that my honourable friend the member for hampstead said that we were anxious to consider whatever may be put to us and i repeat that we shall be glad to do that <e> <s> if in addition there are reports or discussions of the kind that the noble lord mentions i should think it right that they should be included in the pool of thinking on this whole area <e> <s> this is a subject with which at one time i was very much concerned as the noble lord will probably appreciate and as such it is of much interest to me <e>", "<cs> i shall be glad to do that <e>", "<cs> there are already precedents for using the negative procedure in cases similar to those that we are proposing <e> <s> for example may i mention the town and country planning act <e> <s> section of that act is concerned with exempting certain classes of development from the requirement for an industrial development certificate <e> <s> subsection enables the secretary of state to direct that no industrial development certificate shall be required for particular classes or descriptions of development in any area prescribed <e> <s> it does not specify the criteria that the secretary of state must consider and these regulations are subject to negative resolution <e>", "<cs> i have in front of me a very impassioned speech which i was to make on this subject but i do not intend to make it <e> <s> i hope that will comfort the noble baroness <e> <s> i think it is an excellent idea that in leeds they should put up any type of experimental housing <e> <s> it is the only way forward in housing <e> <s> i am glad to know that the noble baroness recognises that leeds as always is in the forefront of these things <e> <s> i will refrain from what i wanted to say about this <e> <s> there really can be no question of back-to-back houses in the old sense being built <e> <s> that is not the intention and it would not happen at all <e> <s> but it is also wrong surely that we should use an archaic provision to deem unfit dwellings which in a free market and chosen by owner occupiers would satisfy all our regulatory requirements and which are capable of meeting perfectly satisfactorily the needs of many people <e> <s> of course not for everyone but there are sections of the communiity who would be delighted to have this kind of accommodation which today would not be built by any means in the style specifically in which these were built in the past <e>", "<cs> again i had intended to make a number of points in some detail because the amendment that is in front of us creates a lot of problems and as such would not be acceptable <e> <s> however i should like and i think this is the general feeling in the committee to remind your lordships that my honourable friend the minister for housing and construction undertook in another place to consider whether the responsibilities of local authorities should be strengthened in this area and to ensure that a government amendment was tabled if it was felt to be necessary <e> <s> i am now able to assure the committee that a government amendment will be tabled for consideration at report stage <e> <s> in the light of that undertaking i wonder whether we may let this amendment go at the moment and we shall be able to consider that which i bring back at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for local authorities themselves to decide their own priorities <e> <s> but the electorate should be left in no doubt that authorities which give cash to support the olympic team are giving that preference over other demands on resources <e> <s> some may feel that this is a strange priority when those authorities complain about difficulties which they claim to be having in reducing their expenditure <e> <s> as to the second part of the question i cannot comment on an issue which is currently before the courts <e> <s> however it is surely right to say that it is for each local authority in the first instance to satisfy itself on the legality of its actions <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i feel that that has nothing to do with the question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of the feelings expressed by my noble friend and there are many who would concur with them <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords there is in fact a power under section of the local government act which enables local authorities to incur expenditure up to the product of a p rate in any one year on purposes which are <e>", "<cs> with great respect my lords i fear that that is very far from the question <e> <s> i should have thought that any kind of assistance to which the noble lord refers is that to which any person at any time going to another country would be entitled to expect <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course <e> <s> i fear there is nothing i can usefully add to the statement made by my noble friend lord trefgarne last month <e>", "<cs> my lords of course people who travel are expected to have luggage with them and everyone recognises the problem that there is in this whole situation <e> <s> i suspect that no one knows more of this than the noble baroness lady burton herself who has pursued the matter so assiduously for so long <e> <s> i am sorry that i am not able to give her the kind of assurances about the services that i know she would like but i think it would be fair to say that this is a problem which is now exercising everyones mind perhaps not least because the noble baroness herself has pursued it so vigorously and without my being able to make promises or commitments at this stage i hope that there may be a solution to this problem before too long <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall be delighted to talk to the noble baroness about it <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i agree <e> <s> who would not agree with that <e> <s> the problem is not to accept that there is in fact a problem but to decide the best way of coping with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord does not really expect me to comment on that although there may be many who have sympathy with the point he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say whether alternative accommodation will be ready by the time mentioned <e> <s> i should like to stress that everybody involved is in fact most concerned about this matter <e> <s> i am aware of the situation to which my noble friend refers although i am sure that she does not wish to imply that all the people she refers to are housed if that is the right word in this particular hostel <e> <s> certainly this <e>", "<cs> my lords i readily confirm that we are indeed very concerned and that we know of the situation to which the right reverend prelate refers <e> <s> i am also able to say that the housing corporation has earmarked funds and i suspect that at the end of the day finance will be a key factor in dealing with this problem <e> <s> i repeat that everyone involved is indeed aware of the problem which would arise if by december alternative accommodation of some kind is not provided <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i entirely accept that <e> <s> i think that the problem arises here because a number of bodies recognise the importance of the matter <e> <s> the association that is running this particular hostel i should have thought very successfully has managed to involve everybody who might be able to make a contribution to solving the problem <e> <s> i take the point of the noble lord lord wells-pestell about the possibility of difficulties arising if too many people are involved but i believe that in this instance everyone is so seized of the problem that <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of people involved is <e> <s> i cannot give my noble friend an assurance in regard to what will happen to the hospital <e> <s> however bearing in mind that in one sense the date is a long way off yet in another sense it is not since it is necessary to consider what has to be done to provide alternative accommodation i can give my noble friend an assurance that everyone is looking very closely at what might be done in the unhappy event of an alternative not being ready by that time <e> <s> this is a matter which even now months ahead is being actively considered <e> <s> i hope that that will be some encouragement <e>", "<cs> my lords it belongs to the metropolitan police <e> <s> it has for some time now been occupied by the association in question on a virtually no-payment basis a peppercorn basis <e> <s> but as i say it is in the ownership of the metropolitan police <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the metropolitan police have plans to redevelop it entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had already said that in fact the government as such do not step in <e> <s> when these situations arise and there are precedents various bodies become involved <e> <s> for example i understand that the glc has confirmed that in the unhappy event that an alternative is not found by the time mentioned the association may nominate people for a number of glc dwellings <e> <s> secondly i have already referred to the fact that the housing corporation is earmarking substantial funds to help in this matter <e> <s> one cannot get away from the fact that at the end of the day the local authorities would have to be involved and of that they are certainly aware <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole question of the provision of hostel facilities for what is undoubtedly a very unhappy section of the community is the subject of a report which i believe my honourable friend in another place said he hopes to make available before too long <e> <s> i believe that the report will confirm what my noble friend lady vickers has said and i think that it will help to make it clear that the problem is a very real one as i said when i started to answer the question <e>", "<cs> my lords we are tending to move away from the question regarding the hostel but of course i take the point that the noble and learned lord makes <e> <s> that kind of problem is very real and has been so for a very long time <e> <s> what one can do about it is the subject of constant debate <e>", "<cs> my lords all that the noble lord says only endorses i think what my noble friend has said and no one is seeking to deny that this is a very real problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on that as such <e> <s> if it is a suggestion which my noble friend makes then of course we will have a look at it <e>", "<cs> council and new town tenants would be given the right to buy their homes <e> <s> that promise did not leave out the elderly or any other class of tenant <e> <s> the governments policy is that as many secure tenants as possible in the public sector should have the right to buy and that exceptions to that rule should be kept to an absolute minimum <e> <s> in the case of old peoples dwellings we concluded that the right and fair approach was to identify in the bill the circumstances in which the right of individual tenants was outweighed by the need for their dwelling to be kept in the ownership of the community and to exclude the dwellings concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure i did and i apologise to my noble friend for not mentioning his name <e> <s> these amendments would have required the conveyance or lease to contain a covenant giving the landlord the right to first refusal at full market value if an elderly persons dwelling sold under the right to buy was resold within years <e> <s> i have fulfilled the commitment which i then <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt it would have been equally useful if perhaps the previous speakers had given the same definition <e> <s> nevertheless the noble baroness leads me on to the points that were made by various speakers and this in fact is one of the very points that i wanted to make <e> <s> what are we talking about when we speak of the elderly <e> <s> for that matter what type of accommodation are we talking about <e> <s> the noble baroness lady denington quite rightly talked of housing people who were i think she said accommodation for fit people <e> <s> she referred to hundreds of thousands of units of accommodation which would be excluded <e> <s> she is absolutely right <e> <s> if this amendment were carried that is exactly what would be the consequence hundreds of thousands of people elderly by any definition that we might care to put and it would not be people who were or over <e> <s> where would noble lords start to draw the line of elderly <e> <s> what is elderly <e>", "<cs> pensioners of or my lords <e> <s> are we saying then that anybody of that age must henceforth not <e>", "<cs> my lords as it happens speaker after speaker in no way referred to that <e> <s> if i am answering on this amendment i am equally entitled so far as i am aware to make reference to the points that others have made and just about everyone who has spoken has referred to the elderly in the most general of terms <e> <s> they have referred to housing which if we think about it goes way beyond even the or that the noble baroness lady denington mentioned because housing of one- or two-bedroomed accommodation and that is what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the accommodation to which one assumes we refer when we speak of housing for the elderly <e> <s> we do not think of it as three or four bedrooms or more we think of one or two bedrooms and therefore by definition if we pass this amendment we should be excluding accommodation i have given way several times and perhaps i may be allowed to finish my speech because there will be an opportunity for others to speak afterwards i am sure <e> <s> this is really the kernel of it <e> <s> what we are talking about here is an exclusion of hundreds of thousands indeed it may be more of one- or two-bedroomed units of accommodation <e> <s> either one believes in the right of people to buy or one does not and this government are committed to giving a right to buy and we would be most concerned if there were such a broad massive exclusion of this kind well-intentioned though it might be <e> <s> the effect would be to go well beyond what many of those on this side of the house believe that it should mean <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i do not think that in any way that does other than make the case for resisting the amendment <e> <s> i was trying to be helpful to the point of saying that i had reservations as to the extent to which it would he used <e> <s> i hope i also stressed that the key factor in the governments objection to the amendment was that we did not want to remove the right to buy <e> <s> as the noble lord said it may be that people will want to do it not so much because of the unit itself but because of the worth of the land on which it is sited <e> <s> leaving aside the fact that most of them are rather small sites even so i still believe that it is the right with which we are concerned it is the right that we have promised it is the right to which we are committed and that is why we cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention of these amendments was to provide that where tenants of flats bought their flats under the right to buy the leases <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that the noble lord lord monson in making his inflationary forecasts is speaking for himself <e> <s> certainly i must dissociate myself from any such forecast he makes <e> <s> may i suggest to the noble lord lord evans that he might also have referred to the possibility of a leek being used <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson put down amendments at committee stage designed to allow for inflation in the imposition of ground rents on flats sold under the right to buy <e> <s> he has now modified his proposals <e> <s> the suggested rent would rise from to instead of from to <e> <s> however i still believe that it is unnecessary to provide for an increase in the ground rent <e> <s> the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the latter question asked by the noble baroness lady birk is that to the best of my knowledge i should not have thought that would have applied <e> <s> i am however open to correction on that and i shall if i may confirm or otherwise my answer a little later <e> <s> i am not absolutely sure but i should not have thought it would apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought in the case the noble baroness lady phillips cites that if the husband had gone on marrying different people as it were for one reason or another there may have been divorces or nature may have taken its course and so on the wife who was living when he eventually died which might be sooner rather than <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought it would go on <e> <s> if he has had many wives all legally entitled of course i should have thought they would all qualify on the back of his time of tenure for such discount as might apply <e> <s> that would be my interpretation but should the position be otherwise i undertake to notify the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords it would depend on what kind of a party it was <e> <s> if it was the kind of party which was just one of those things that comes and goes then i think it would have no effect whatever <e> <s> if however it was the kind of party which resulted in say the husband departing the marital home indefinitely if he was then to die i should have thought the wife who in our hypothetical case i am assuming remained in the house would be entitled to his time of tenure as a qualifying basis <e> <s> as i said to the noble baroness lady phillips if i am wrong i will let the noble baroness know but i suspect i am not wrong on this one <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say that if the same people who had written to the noble lord lord monson <e>", "<cs> my lords when we said that we wanted it to be tightly drawn and that we believed it to be tightly drawn we did and do mean just that <e> <s> i wrote to the noble baroness lady david saying that we believed that what is now clause as drafted provides that the right to defer completion was open only to those who could not afford to buy at once <e> <s> since then however i have received further advice on this matter <e> <s> i should hate it to be thought that the bill as drafted was defective but in the light of the noble baronesss advocacy and possibly to her not inconsiderable surprise though i hope not displeasure i am happy to tell her that in fact i am prepared to accept this amendment and by so doing i may even convert those on the opposite benches to the policy embodied in the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to say to the noble baroness lady david when she stood up having had her previous amendment accepted steady steady <e> <s> in fact i listened very carefully to what she said when proposing this amendment because it was none too clear at least to me from its terms precisely what it was supposed to achieve <e> <s> however i am now much clearer <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i withdrew amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it was not moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the point made by the noble baroness that the prohibition of the recovery of the costs of a right-to-buy sale by the landlord from the tenant in clause of the bill makes a departure from current practice in some local authorities when a house is sold under the general consent for council house sales <e> <s> but circumstances are not entirely the same in both cases <e> <s> the question of how the costs incurred by the parties to a sale under the right to buy should be met is not clear-cut and called for a judgment to be made <e> <s> the judgment that we came to is reflected in clause <e> <s> it was that each party to the transaction should bear its own costs arising from a sale under the right to buy <e> <s> there are two reasons for this <e> <s> first it seemed a fair arrangement on general grounds given that the bill introduces a statutory right for the secure tenant to buy and a statutory obligation on the landlord to sell <e> <s> secondly it corresponded to normal arrangements when a dwelling was sold on the private market <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i think we have here a fundamental difference really of what the impact on the finances of local authorities will be <e> <s> i do not see it at all as the noble baroness does with her fears about the effect that it will have on the finances of local authorities <e> <s> indeed quite the contrary even with the discounts <e> <s> therefore the main point upon which she makes her case which she does so well is obviously one on which we do not agree <e> <s> for that and the other reasons i have already given <e> <s> i fear that at this stage i am not able to take it back although i entirely understand the point that she is making <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to ask can anyone join in <e> <s> perhaps i need not quite do that <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord evans in fact made the point i was going to make namely that the government are it so happens at the present time considering the report of the royal commission on legal services and clearly until he had some views as to that he would not want to make any such moves <e> <s> so without my making too much of a do of it i think i can leave the matter to the noble lord lord bruce <e>", "<cs> my lords this subsection allows the secretary of state to serve on a landlord a notice requiring the submission of information that he needs to deal with a case over which he has intervened <e> <s> the subsection provides that the officer of the landlord who has control of the information or documents required or who is designated in the notice is to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the notice is complied with <e> <s> this is a power which is very plainly needed without it a hostile landlord would be able to block progress on the right to buy simply by refusing to tell the secretary of state the facts that he needs to know <e> <s> the noble lord has suggested however that the subsection could produce conflicts of loyalty for the landlords officers <e> <s> i fail to see how this can be so <e> <s> as one who is not without some experience of working with local government officers i accept that they would always normally <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite content to do that if that is what the house wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords i will speak then in effect to amendment no <e> <s> because i think that might be <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house so far as i am aware and i have to put it that way because i think this is something that i should like to confirm later unless the institutions to which my noble friend refers dr barnardo and the church of england childrens society operate through a housing association which i suppose it is always possible for them to do the proposals in the amendment would not cover them <e> <s> i put it that way carefully because i am not certain whether that is the intention of the amendment <e> <s> i think that is probably the exact position at the moment <e> <s> i would have to try to ascertain if that is so and whether or not if it is so it is something we ought to think about <e> <s> i am sorry i cannot be more positive on what is to my noble friend an important point <e> <s> at the moment i cannot be more forthcoming on it but i recognise this is not as helpful as my noble friend would like it to be <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house on the latter point raised by my noble friend it would depend on what were the objectives of the housing association if they were operating if operating is the right word within the social services content of the act which i am grateful to my noble friend for handing to me <e> <s> then the flat would be excluded in that way <e> <s> if i can be helpful to my noble friend on this she with her great knowledge of the subject refers to the act and to what i said regarding the bodies included in them <e> <s> i said i was not certain of this point <e> <s> i went on to say that i recognise her great concern and i would certainly undertake to look at this point <e> <s> she is probably right on it <e> <s> i should not even question the possibility that with her specialist knowledge she might not be right <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord wells-pestell can enlighten us <e> <s> in any case i will undertake to look at that point <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house to be helpful i said that if they were a housing association they were covered but i went on to say on the assumption that they were not covered i would still be willing to have a look at that <e> <s> i think the bill as we have it now before us and this amendment do not affect the position of those living in tied accommodation <e> <s> these bodies are not landlord authorities unless they are housing associations so that security and the right to buy does not apply to them in any case <e> <s> i think we are chasing ourselves in something of a circle <e> <s> i think they are in any case not going to create a problem they are excluded in any event <e> <s> therefore i do not think we will have any problem with them at all <e> <s> the right to buy does not apply <e> <s> therefore i think that i can satisfy those who are concerned on this <e> <s> whether we get there one way or the other does not matter so long as we get to the end position that we require <e> <s> on this i am glad to say all is well in the end <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house again at the end of the day i was absolutely satisfied i would not say so categorically unless i felt i was able to do so that the institutions to which my noble friend referred are excluded <e> <s> therefore the problem does not arise for them <e> <s> i am most reluctant to take back anything that is not absolutely essential at this stage <e> <s> we probably took back too much at the committee stage in an endeavour to be helfpul and try to do things <e> <s> of course i understand the attitude taken by the noble baroness and i am grateful for that <e> <s> there are one or two things coming along which are special but we have brought forward the amendment to meet the situation and i have now confirmed that it meets it entirely <e> <s> i would not say that if i did not think so <e> <s> i hope that we can proceed on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the fear that my noble friend has expressed that landlords will find it harder to use shortlife property <e> <s> i think however that she need not be as concerned as i know she has been about this matter <e> <s> the exclusion from security of tenure in paragraph covers all tenancies of property acquired for development within the meaning of the town and country planning act <e> <s> i should like to emphasise how wide this definition goes <e> <s> it covers converting an old house into several flats or bedsitters <e> <s> it covers any work which will substantially affect the external appearance of the building <e> <s> it covers a change of use for example from individual units to a hostel <e> <s> it also covers of course cases where there is to be demolition which will involve either a change of use or a different structure <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house if the noble baroness wishes to press the amendment it is of course her right so to do but i certainly cannot accept many of the points she has just made about what local authorities do or do not do and what attitudes they take or do not take to people who are in this kind of accommodation <e> <s> it has not been my experience that local authorities try to take advantage of any situation so as to get out of any obligations that they may have to house people <e> <s> that is not so it does not happen that way in practice in my experience at least <e> <s> while i cannot answer for every local authority certainly i can speak for all those which i do know and they are very many <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter was discussed at some length in another place and in committee here by your lordships <e> <s> i repeat that the government do not lightly dismiss the concern expressed about the operation of the distraint system <e> <s> on the other hand we have strong representations from the local authority associations and from individual local authorities of all political persuasions that nothing should be done to alter the right of public sector landlords to take direct action and distrain on goods where this seemed the right course <e>", "<cs> my lords i am becoming confused and it certainly is not by the hour because as my noble friend lord teviot who is not in the house now said as far as i am concerned we are here for a long session yet <e> <s> there are important matters which need the maximum discussion <e> <s> i do not think it is particularly late anyhow by some standards it is very early really <e> <s> even so i confess to some confusion <e> <s> on the one hand we are being assailed very much from the opposite benches for our rigidity <e>", "<cs> my lords despite what the noble lord has said we as yet have no reason to believe that many local authorities in england and wales now make it a condition that a spouses rent arrears should first be repaid before a new tenancy is granted <e> <s> this practice was understandably strongly criticised by the local ombudsman in two cases dating from and <e> <s> i referred also as did my noble friend lord belstead in our discussion of a similar amendment in committee to the documents issued by the department of the environment a circular on the housing of one-parent families issued in and a report from the housing services advisory group issued in which have explained why arrears should not be treated as a disqualification for housing in the circumstances of a family break-up <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that this amendment would be unfairly discriminatory against people who have come to a public sector landlord as homeless <e> <s> clause of the bill puts licences granted by public sector landlords on a par with tenancies granted by them except where the licence has been granted to someone who originally entered as a trespasser a squatter in other words <e> <s> we believe this is right in all other cases including that of homeless people <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect this manuscript amendment was put down in the dinner break <e> <s> how can one possibly be expected to consider this properly <e> <s> having said that i would have to say that in fairness to the noble lord all the points that he has raised were not new <e> <s> he is not presenting something to us that we have not heard before <e> <s> i do not know how many times i have tried to answer this at this dispatch box <e> <s> i asked my noble friends who were answering the noble lord before i arrived because i am sure that the same questions were being asked <e> <s> i say that in no disrespectful way the noble lord knows that i would not do that <e>", "<cs> my lords we are anxious as is my noble friend that this important safeguard the certificate of fair rent for shorthold tenants should not impose undue procedural constraints on the landlord or cause any delay in getting property lets <e> <s> shorthold apart there is a strong case for improving the certificate of fair rent procedures in schedule to the rent act in the same way as registration of fair rent procedures in schedule to that act have already been improved by amendments in another place <e> <s> we have been discussing with the institute of rent officers what can be done to streamline the certificate of fair <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not really think that is apposite to the point we are discussing <e> <s> i would think that the complaint we are getting in this house from noble lords opposite is that we are in fact carrying out that which we said in our manifesto we would do <e> <s> i would only say to the noble lord on that particular point that he need have no cause to doubt that we are looking into that matter as we are doing with everything else that we said in our manifesto <e> <s> i trust he is one of those who will not criticise us at any time when we point out that what we are doing is what we said in the manifesto that we would do <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house perhaps i may say just this <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble baroness appreciates that the effect of her amendment is that it will not allow any immediate decontrol <e> <s> there are so many <e>", "<cs> my lords i am able and gladly do so to confirm that position to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i have no hesitation in saying yes of course we shall certainly try to do that no hesitation at all <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in discussing the last amendment i have considered the whole question of rent act loopholes very carefully since our discussions in committee <e> <s> however i am afraid that again i am not convinced that this new clause would deal satisfactorily with the so called bogus holiday let loophole <e> <s> what this clause would require is as the noble baroness lady birk said a special register of holiday accommodation to be maintained by local authorities <e> <s> it would also require local authorities to approve the rent that it would be appropriate for landlords of holiday accommodation to charge <e> <s> i would be extremely reluctant to see an additional burden of this kind imposed on local authorities merely as a way of enforcing the rent acts <e> <s> nor do i think local authorities quite frankly are in any position to determine what would be an appropriate rent for holiday accommodation in their areas <e> <s> the noble baroness said that some already operate such a register <e> <s> they may indeed do so and it is certainly up to them but i would be very interested for myself to know how they decide what is an appropriate arrangement <e> <s> allowing if you like authorities to do this is vastly different from imposing upon them a duty so to do <e> <s> i think that there is a whole world of difference in that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make a few comments <e> <s> i would only add to what i said previously that as regards the loopholes in the rent acts and noble lords opposite know more about them than i do we accept that there are of course problems <e> <s> what i have said in answer to the amendment is that i just do not believe that this is the way to deal with the problems for the reasons that i have given <e> <s> that does not mean to say that i do not think that there should be attempts to find solutions to them <e> <s> however i certainly do not think that this is practical for a whole host of reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to say that to the best of my knowledge westminster is not operating a register <e> <s> it has expressed some interest in so doing and would like to know the implications <e> <s> certainly i see no reason why we should not approach the local authority associations and ask them to advise us if they will which of their members are so doing and that i gladly undertake to do and to pass the information on to the noble baroness <e> <s> we shall check them all out and pass the information on <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the point raised by the noble lord lord gifford which i have not answered but i hope that what i have said in general terms covers the fact that we are interested in the whole subject in any case and therefore if there is a particular point presumably we shall pick it up <e> <s> once we have all this material away and have time to do it in a proper and hopefully dare i say more leisurely way then i would expect that we can cover everything <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i find myself in some difficulty in responding to an amendment tabled at such a late stage and dealing with such an arcane statute as the duchy of cornwall management act <e> <s> i believe however that the matter is of some importance to the noble lord <e> <s> as he fairly said himself he lives in a property owned by the duchy of cornwall <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i said quite that <e> <s> it is perhaps important that i should carefully repeat what i said on that point <e> <s> i said that the noble lord will appreciate that the crown estate commissioners are prepared in principle to grant long assignable but non-enfranchisable leases to their tenants <e> <s> however the act prevents such leases lasting for more than years and it was the noble lord who wished to remove this barrier <e> <s> then i went on to say that i cannot contemplate our amending that act in this housing bill <e> <s> i said in an attempt to be helpful that we would take careful note of what has been said and that we would pass it on to the duchy of cornwall management the people concerned and that we would have a look later on to see whether there was anything that could be done to help <e> <s> that is all i was able to say <e>", "<cs> my lords by the leave of the house i am afraid that i cannot take up the noble lords proposal <e> <s> the amendments which the government have themselves made in your lordships house to extend the rent acts to the duchy of cornwall do not in any way amend the act or the other legislation governing the duchy <e> <s> they stay within the four walls of the existing duchy legislation <e> <s> certainly our crown estates amendments do not concern long leases at all <e> <s> i cannot be any more helpful on this and i cannot take the point any further <e> <s> this came up as an amendment yesterday afternoon referring to the act <e> <s> my goodness me <e> <s> i do not think i am being at all unreasonable in saying that i cannot go any further with it now <e>", "<cs> my lords the latter point which the noble baroness lady david raised in many ways highlights the great difficulty that there is in coming forward with something which on the one hand both recognises and sets out to do something about what is a very real problem and on the other hand considers the enormous open-endedness and all that flows from that and what it could mean <e> <s> it is a very difficult one to get just right <e> <s> i suppose one will not get it just right but one will get it as right as one can <e> <s> that is why i said my noble friend said he was not here when i said it that is fair enough at the beginning that what we really must do here is have discussions <e> <s> we have already had first talks with the local authority associations <e> <s> as i recall it the housing consultative council met within the last days or so when this matter was talked about and all the local authority associations were involved <e> <s> clearly this is one instance where there will have to be the most careful consultation and discussions with the ama and the others to pick up the point that the noble baroness makes and the many others which flow from the very considerable requirement that is being put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house may i say that i do not know that i can or need to add to what i said when i made my opening remarks which i can assure the noble lord lord gifford were very carefully thought through <e> <s> this was not just a case of having speaking notes and reading things out <e> <s> i try not to do that <e> <s> it is a case of looking very carefully into what is said talking about it thinking about it and adjusting it where necessary <e> <s> that is why the words chosen which will be in <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lords will pay the same detailed attention to what i have to say as they have done to other noble lords who have spoken because despite the very emotive tones that have been used in this debate i believe there are other arguments which in fact show that to do what this amendment suggests would not benefit more elderly people <e> <s> it would in fact provide benefit to some at the expense of many more elderly people <e> <s> may i go through the points carefully <e> <s> i have tried to look as did the noble lord lord banks at what has been said before <e> <s> i have taken the arguments and tried to think them through logically <e> <s> this is the fourth occasion on which this amendment has been discussed in this chamber in the last few months <e> <s> i listened carefully to the arguments advanced earlier and i have listened to them again during this debate <e> <s> while one may indeed have sympathy with the intention that lies behind the amendment i have to say at the outset that the governments attitude to the amendment has not changed <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady vickers will appreciate that on the vast majority of recent schemes housing associations have provided no money of their own whatsoever <e> <s> the costs of the schemes have been covered by housing association grant supplemented by loans to be serviced out of rental income <e> <s> it was never the intention of housing association grant that it should put an association into surplus and i am sure at the time when grants have been <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i am not absolutely clear as to the precise point the noble baroness is making but i will undertake as i always do to take it away and look at it <e> <s> i cannot go further than that at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords to take up the last point made i do not feel that i am able to give the assurance that my noble friend requests <e> <s> after all i suppose it is not impossible to envisage a situation where an association was in deficit for all kinds of reasons and yet was in surplus so far as the funds which had come from grants were concerned <e> <s> however it must surely be a comfort to know that if that were the eventuality any secretary of state would surely have to take that into account <e> <s> but i could not give an assurance at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much listening to what the noble baroness is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i too really am astonished at this amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness began by saying that public housing should not be profit-making <e> <s> i presume therefore that it is quite satisfactory to her that public housing should be loss-making and there is plenty of evidence of that <e> <s> i am not concerned with my brief on this <e> <s> this was a subject which the local authorities the local authority associations talked about for years <e> <s> the one thing they always said was that the right to decide what local rent should be the right to decide what should be done with any surpluses from those rents should be for local decision and that is precisely what we are doing in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first apologise for speaking perhaps more quickly than i should have done <e> <s> one is caught up in the wish to get on with the proceedings but at the same time to consider the problems of the <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there is an answer and i was about to say that i can give my interpretation of it if the noble baroness wishes but i think it is always preferable for me to confirm and to write to the noble baroness and that i gladly undertake to do <e> <s> if the noble baroness is not happy with that then i will check this point out and will return to it even as we continue with the proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for raising once more this question of advance payments <e> <s> i think our objectives are very much the same and as the noble lord was kind enough to say we have had some discussion on this matter since the committees proceedings we have talked about the difficulties of adopting any approach which is different from that now laid down in the schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords i explained in committee that there was no need for the amendment <e> <s> however i am obliged to the noble earl for moving it again today because it provides me with the opportunity to clarify a fundamental point about schedule on which i believe he seeks an assurance and which may be helpful generally <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of sinking funds has been raised certainly here in this house indeed in committee and in another place <e> <s> the government have said that this is a matter which must be looked into in the longer term and i am happy to repeat that undertaking <e> <s> in recent years my department has been engaged on a study of the problems of tenants of flats in the private sector particularly in mansion blocks <e> <s> the first fruits of that study are the provisions in schedule <e> <s> we have in fact already started to look into the question of sinking funds but we came to the conclusion that this is such a complex matter that there was no possibility of bringing forward effective proposals within the time-scale of this bill <e> <s> i think it is fair to say and i say it certainly in no spirit of criticism that none of the amendments relating to sinking funds which has been tabled at various stages of the bill either here or in another place including the present one would be satisfactory despite the fact that we know the intentions behind thernand indeed approve of them <e>", "<cs> my lords paragraph of schedule gives a tenant of a flat the right to a summary of costs relating to his service charge <e> <s> if there are more than four flats in the building or if the costs relate also to another building the summary must be certified by an independent accountant <e> <s> the amendment substitutes other buildings in the plural for another building <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly do that without any hesitation <e> <s> i continue to be slightly puzzled although <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is fair to bring the noble lord lord davies in to bat at this time of night <e> <s> he certainly introduces a breath of fresh air but i cannot agree with most of what he said <e> <s> but he says it with such panache that he adds a great deal to the proceedings <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would give leaseholders of flats the right to an extension lease but not the right to buy the freehold <e> <s> the reason why the act does not apply to the flats is that under the existing law enfranchisement of individual flats would lead to difficulties regarding the future maintenance of the block <e> <s> the positive covenants which would be required <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that my noble friend has tabled a substantive and rather complicated amendment which came to our notice at pm means that in the time available we have been unable to examine its effects <e> <s> it may be that the simple answer is that the landlord can apply to the leasehold valuation tribunal which will fix a price <e> <s> then under the rules the tenant must complete within a specified timescale <e> <s> however i propose to write to my noble friend in more detail and <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might remind the house of the intention of paragraph of schedule to the bill which is to close a loophole in the leasehold reform act which some large commercial landlords have been exploiting in order to get round the act <e> <s> the act contains a provision which exempts from it all tenancies terminable by notice after a death or marriage <e> <s> that was intended to allow for the creation of what i referred to in committee as <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord will be pleased or sad at the comments i have to make <e> <s> one is not that the amendment is defective <e> <s> to that extent i hope he may feel it is a plus <e> <s> would that i could say other things to make him feel likewise but i fear i cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords the last thing i would want to do at this time of the day is to enrage the noble lord <e> <s> certainly i have no wish to do that <e> <s> i must say i actually feel much sympathy with the way he puts the point <e> <s> i clearly cannot promise him that anything will be done about this but i promise him from my own interest and because of the way he puts the point that i will want to talk to officials about this to see whether or not it is practical <e> <s> i make no promises i am sure the noble lord will accept that <e> <s> if he feels so strongly about this technical point i feel i ought to take it and have a look at it on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords it is up to each local authority itself to decide in its own area what it needs to do <e> <s> it might be helpful to the noble baroness if i were to say that there are grants available <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely why i said that under the urban grants the government have given some this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what kind of imagination the noble baroness is really wishing us to show <e> <s> but if it is in terms of the amount of money and i suspect that that is what it is then i should have thought that would relate very much to the resources which are available and there never seem to be enough of them <e>", "<cs> my lords this new clause would in fact remove much of the freedom which local authorities enjoy to give a reasonable degree of preference to local people in the allocation of their housing <e> <s> it would oblige them to take on to their lists people from outside their area who might meet some highly debatable criteria for example those wishing to move for some quite undefined as the amendment states special social reason <e> <s> i would not want to have to interpret that one to any housing committee of which i was ever a member <e> <s> the result of the amendment would undermine the freedom which local authorities have to manage their housing stock <e> <s> yet this freedom is what enables local authorities to tailor their allocation policies to local needs and to give preference to local people where they think it is deserved <e> <s> i can see no cause for this bill to interfere with such matters and i think the proposed new clause betrays a fundamental distrust of local authorities ability to make sensitive and intelligent allocation decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might respond <e> <s> i am pleased that i was able to amuse the noble baroness <e> <s> perhaps that is something that one does not do what she says <e> <s> the bill with the exception of the right to buy which <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should make one or two things quite clear that would not be clear if one listened only to what has just been said <e> <s> i made it clear in committee that the government of course recognise the validity of the concern that has been expressed that existing statutory and protected tenants may be persuaded to sign away their security by agreeing to take a shorthold <e> <s> that is precisely why the bill makes it quite clear that an existing statutory or protected tenant cannot have his tenancy converted into shorthold <e> <s> this shorthold proposal is basically about people who now do not have accommodation who want to become tenants of accommodation which does not exist at all <e> <s> there is great concern for what will happen to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a few more comments before the amendment is pressed <e> <s> first as regards the notice it really is not fair to say that because the notice is not here one is having difficulty in producing it <e> <s> that is not the case at all <e> <s> it is quite normal practice <e> <s> i am advised that in situations such as this notices of this kind are in fact prepared when the legislation is there and before it is enacted <e> <s> i think that that is something of a red herring <e> <s> but what is much more important is that if the amendment is passed it means that no one will be able to take a shorthold tenancy within the same building in which he lives whether or not he wants to <e> <s> he <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the broadcast to which the noble lord lord strabolgi referred and i am not aware that the conservative manifesto said we would restrict shortholds to empty <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i understand that is probably the only way i can properly speak on this <e> <s> i am sure that is right but it is not really the entire point <e> <s> what that says is so but it does not exclude our going further <e> <s> it says yes for those premises we must give the opportunity for them to be converted into shorthold but it does not say anywhere there that we should limit the shorthold experiment if that is what it is only to those <e> <s> i would submit that is not so <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is much likelihood of that my lords but may i say straightaway that as i understand it the intention of the amendment is to give the sitting short-hold tenant the right of first refusal to a further term if the landlord intends to go on letting beyond the end of the short-hold term <e> <s> this is a proposal which the government examined very carefully when framing their shorthold proposals but it is much less simple than it looks <e> <s> we believe that it would be extremely difficult to operate in practice <e> <s> furthermore we do not think that as a matter of policy it is on balance desirable as i shall try to explain <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it will not be felt because i deal with this perhaps more shortly than i have with other amendments on shortholds that we take it any less seriously <e> <s> indeed i entirely take the point that my noble friend lord hylton made as to that <e> <s> as to the observation by the noble lord lord evans that he found my responses in committee on this to be i think he said very halfhearted and that i did not give him the assurance he wanted i am not usually half-hearted about that which i say <e> <s> in view of the other comments which have been made about what i have said over the course of the bill i would have thought that was one of the few suggestions that might have been made <e> <s> however i take it in the spirit in which i am sure it was meant <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to speak to both of these amendments no <e> <s> and no <e> <s> because what i have to say really covers them both <e> <s> i do not for a moment question the noble lord being emotive on the subject <e> <s> why not if one feels deeply about it <e> <s> i think it is right that one should <e> <s> if i sometimes speak the same way i hope the noble lord would feel similarly so far as i was concerned <e> <s> there would be something strange about a debate in your lordships house on housing if the noble lord lord janner were not to raise the subject which he is raising now <e> <s> i understand the very great feeling he has about it <e> <s> indeed he tabled very similar amendments to clauses and <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i clearly think that it is wrong to link fair rents to some artificial extraneous index <e> <s> it would really undermine the whole of the rent act basis taking account of the particular circumstances of the tenancy on which they are assessed <e>", "<cs> my lords there are just two points that i should like to make <e> <s> the first is that the way in which the duchy of cornwall manages its estate within its current statutory framework must of course be a matter for it and <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see the point of this amendment which i know has the support of the law society but i <e>", "<cs> my lords i say at once that the government have received a number of representations about the rateable value limits in the rent act <e> <s> at present these are in london and elsewhere as has been said <e> <s> tenancies of properties above these rateable values are not protected tenancies under the rent act <e> <s> there are a relatively small number of these tenancies most of which <e>", "<cs> my lords for over years following a high court decision local authorities were able to use the statutory nuisance provisions in the public health acts to secure the remedying of defects which might not have been substantial in themselves but which interfered with the personal comfort of the occupiers <e> <s> authorities made very considerable use of these powers <e> <s> however in the divisional court ruled that the earlier decision could not be sustained <e> <s> the effect of their ruling was that conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say at once that i very much appreciate the concern which has moved the noble viscount to table this amendment to the tenants charter <e> <s> i know he has been particularly anxious about this matter for some time and indeed the very fact that he has felt the need to move it again at this late stage i think indicates the measure of his concern <e> <s> i have great respect for that and i do not mean that in the rather lighthearted way in which people were talking about respect earlier i really do mean it <e> <s> the noble viscount is of course particularly anxious about charities which provide short-term accommodation for groups such as unsupported mothers or homeless families who are in urgent need and the need for flexibility which the noble lord stresses is something which i obviously accept <e> <s> but as i have explained previously i cannot accept the amendment which would have the effect of denying the tenants charter rights to a potentially large number of tenants simply because of their landlords objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords for the convenience of the house i will speak to <e>", "<cs> my lords i touched earlier on some of the points that i wanted to make on the noble baronesss amendment but perhaps i can just make one or two further observations <e> <s> the noble baroness has sought to make it a further condition that there shall have been at least one suitable offer of accommodation <e> <s> if she looks at clause she will see that an order for possession under ground cannot be made unless the court is satisfied both that suitable alternative accommodation will be available for the tenant and that it is reasonable to make the order <e>", "<cs> my lords paragraph of schedule as drafted requires the landlord to inform his tenants of proposed work costing more than whatever is the prescribed amount in the particular block <e> <s> he can do this either by giving each tenant a notice describing the works and inviting comments and a copy of the estimates for the work or by displaying a copy perhaps more than one where it is likely to come to their notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i would remind the house that the consultation requirements in schedule to the bill contain a very strong sanction not to be found in the existing legislation so that if the landlord fails to comply with these requirements he will not normally be able to recover the full cost of the works even if the cost was reasonable <e> <s> he could be very heavily out of pocket as a result <e> <s> nevertheless we have to recognise that there may be circumstances in which he could not comply with the requirements <e> <s> for example in the case of very specialised work such as repairs to a lift he might not be able to get two estimates because no firm other than the one which had installed the lift would quote for the job <e> <s> it would be wrong in our view for the landlord to be penalised as a result and paragraph gives the court discretion to dispense with the consultation requirements if satisfied that the landlord had acted reasonably <e>", "<cs> my lords government amendments in committee of your lordships house to clause and schedule fulfil our commitment to give fixed fair rent tenants the opportunity to challenge the evidence on service costs deployed by their landlords before the rent officer <e> <s> the rent officer in fixing a fair rent would anyway only take account of service costs which he considered to be reasonable <e> <s> but our amendments give an added safeguard to the tenant <e>", "<cs> my lords you may recall that when i moved at report stage the amendment that brought schedule to the bill i explained that it was an amendment with far-reaching implications in that it provided a means of laying a duty on local authorities to take action in the matter of means of escape and for this reason we felt that it was imperative to allow time for the most thorough consultation on the question of whether and if so how the scope of the duty should be restricted <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave may i just say that after having heard my noble friend i shall again read carefully what she has said <e> <s> of course i shall write to her on the point <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady vickers has tabled two amendments dealingwith houses in multiple occupation which would have the combined effect of placing local authorities under a double duty first to inspect their areas and secondly to secure adequate means of escape from all houses in multiple occupation occupied by three or more households or six or more individuals <e> <s> this may involve the inspection of tens of thousands of properties <e> <s> what arguments are advanced to demonstrate the rightness of the arbitrary choice of size <e> <s> how are the local authorities to find the resources of men and money <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> i wish at the outset to thank noble lords for the very great effort they have put into the consideration of the bill <e> <s> we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that when i tried very briefly to make a few courteous winding-up notes on this bill i did not expect that the response would be the blatant political diatribes that we have had to listen to from the noble baroness lady birk and the noble lord lord hatch and i am very sad indeed that i have to wind up this whole thing on such a sour note <e> <s> it certainly was not my intention to do so but when the noble baroness and the noble lord read their speeches in <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has covered almost as much ground as the bill itself <e> <s> i hope your lordships will forgive me and understand if i do not respond to every speaker or to all the points that have been raised <e> <s> obviously it would not be practicable unless we want to start immediately the late night sittings about which we were warned by the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley <e> <s> we should be making a very early start on those late nights my lords if i were to answer all the detailed points not that i am not tempted to have a go <e>", "<cs> all right my lords i will try to pick up individual points on the direct labour organisations <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill asked whether private firms would have to provide the same training the same standards the same security of employment the same instant service that the private sector would <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad the noble lord has said that he did not raise that particular point because i had not noted it down and i am glad to think that i did not miss it i think the noble lord was referring to the ama in particular at least i hope he was otherwise i have that one wrong <e> <s> if he was i think i am probably as aware of the amas line on this as most people are <e> <s> it is not all that long since i was arguing the cases for them <e> <s> if i have missed it <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i recognise that sir john does not stand alone <e> <s> he just does these things in his own way but alone he does not stand <e> <s> however i could reel off the names of many other very distinguished leaders in local governmnt who feel exactly the opposite to the way sir john feels but then we would not get very far if we started to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords of course <e> <s> he would refer for example to councillor peter sparling the recent very distinguished leader of the leeds authority councillor john hunscombe the recent leader of bolton the shadow leader of newcastle councillor moore and to the shadow leader of tyne and wear councillor conway <e> <s> i do not think that i should weary the house but i assure the noble lord that i could go on at great length <e> <s> there is more than one opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall answer that point although i would rather have completed my observations on the financial implications <e> <s> but if i do not answer it i shall run off and then i shall not do it <e> <s> on that point if that was the only point in the bill as regards the designations and the requirements for disposals of land there might indeed be something in what the noble lord says <e> <s> but the bill calls for all bodies including nationalised bodies to have exactly the same obligations as regards land <e> <s> there is and i know that the noble lord will not differ on this a tremendous problem of this kind of land that is around <e> <s> i do not want to weary the house at this time of night <e> <s> i should dearly love to give some examples of some of the awful things that i have seen happen with land that has lain derelict for years and years <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill is as it says the planning and land bill <e> <s> it has to do with land and it is land which is owned by these other bodies and that is why i made the point i did <e> <s> may i come back to the financial provisions <e> <s> the point of complexity was made and i am turning this over very quickly because the hour is getting late <e> <s> there was concern about the complexity <e> <s> the new system i maintain is much less complex than the present rate support grant system <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons reasons and amendments be considered forthwith <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> and agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> proposed in lieu thereof <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i ought to say very much more nor do i intend to <e> <s> i tried when making my remarks to do so as clearly and as slowly as i could because i felt that the matter was of sufficient importance that it should be put very very carefully and that each word should be so registered as to be understood <e> <s> therefore perhaps the noble lord lord hatch will excuse me if i refer him to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth not insist <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed for the reason numbered <e>", "<cs> my lords could i say first that i wonder what the noble lord lord hatch of lusby thinks i have been doing since we had the debate to which he refers <e> <s> if i had had the opportunity to visit my own home or the areas surrounding it i should have been pleased indeed and i look forward to that pleasure before too long <e> <s> so i have to tell the noble lord that i have been unable to take advantage of the suggestion which he made but that i certainly undertake so to do <e> <s> i am sure that i shall then concur with him about the pleasantness which i shall see there <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed for the reason numbered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> but accept in lieu thereof amendment no <e> <s> proposed by the commons together with consequential amendment no <e> <s> which has the effect of applying this provision to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> as a consequential amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> to the lords amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady vickers raised this point at the third reading and i explained then and still stand by my explanation that we should not be happy with the imposition on local authorities of a double duty <e> <s> the government have made it quite clear that we shall be giving consideration as to how my right honourable friend will exercise his order-making power under the new schedule <e> <s> any duty laid on local authorities by such an order would be additional to the duty to inspect laid by section and i therefore cannot see that the latter duty should be imposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord wigoder for saying precisely what i would have said on the first of the three points which the noble baroness makes <e> <s> in my opinion there is nothing whatsoever wrong nor can one possibly talk of retrospective action when what we have said is precisely what we have been pressed to say for some time not least by the supporters in another place of the noble lords opposite or should it be the other way round <e> <s> i am not sure <e> <s> the fact is that for some time now we have been pressed to say which authorities if any would come within the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not quite know what is meant in this context by the word negotiations <e> <s> if one could substitute discussions and talks for that word then of course there have been discussions and talks with all the associations <e> <s> the door has been and will remain open all the time for that to be done and that will go on <e> <s> beyond that i can only repeat that i know of no reason in any way to consider that there has been any impropriety whatever and on that basis i suggest we now proceed with the bill and discuss on their merits the individual amendments and clauses as we come to them <e>", "<cs> i cannot do anything of the kind my lords <e> <s> the position is absolutely clear <e> <s> it is up to any association or indeed any individual members of your lordships house to come along and talk and they have done just that <e> <s> they do not always come together in fact they usually do not do so but come singly and discuss their points of view and i see nothing at all wrong in that <e> <s> noble lords cannot expect me to justify that which is in the press <e> <s> i do not feel able to go beyond the explanation i have given <e> <s> i have not tried to fudge words but to say what the position is and that is what i seek to do <e>", "<cs> i want to be helpful my lords but i cannot give the kind of answer that would apparently satisfy the noble lord because i am not sure precisely what it is he is seeking to ascertain <e> <s> i have tried in good faith to say exactly what has happened namely that discussions have taken place with the associations with individual members of this house and generally with people who have made suggestions about what they would like the government to do <e> <s> that is what it is all about so far as i am aware and i cannot go further <e>", "<cs> this clause and that is what we are talking about now is a purely technical one which makes transitional arrangements to smooth the changeover to the new tendering and accounting systems <e> <s> it deals with those relatively rare situations where authorities have entered into long-term maintenance contracts with other bodies using their existing statutory powers <e> <s> the value of some of these agreements may well be such that under the new regulations to be made under clause to control the entry into works contracts they would have to be put out to competition <e>", "<cs> in fact there is no contractor <e> <s> the local authority is the contractor <e> <s> as i said the clause is a technical one and it is to deal with the transitional arrangements <e> <s> but in a situation such as the noble viscount describes there is no contractor as such <e> <s> it would be the local authority <e>", "<cs> the committee will need to remember what sort of regulations will be made under this clause <e> <s> there will first of all be the regulations made under subsection to specify the descriptions of work which must first be subjected to competition before being undertaken by direct labour <e> <s> these descriptions will be expressed essentially in terms of monetary limits on the size of construction or maintenance projects <e> <s> my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state stated in another place what in the first instance those limits would be <e> <s> he also promised and i repeat that pledge now that the thresholds would be updated to take account of changing building prices <e> <s> so the regulations will need to be re-made at intervals simply to preserve the <e>", "<cs> that was quite a series of requests but before responding to them i must thank my noble friend lord sandford who i trust has taken careful note of the art of delegation and how it works <e> <s> i must also thank my noble friends who have been helpful so far and i am sure i shall be looking for help from them again before this committee stage is through <e> <s> i wish the noble lord lord bruce of donington had not talked about mania for power <e> <s> i should have thought that this week following so closely on what happened last week that would have been the last thing noble lords opposite would have wanted to talk about <e> <s> in any event this is not a matter of tremendous moment <e>", "<cs> i am deeply grateful to my noble friend for that <e> <s> the calls on parliamentary time are indeed of major importance and i did know that that was a very important factor in this issue <e> <s> i certainly could not give to the noble lord lord mishcon the kind of general undertaking he would ask for but we will take this away and consider it <e> <s> again unless i can see in another way on more careful study the evidence to the contrary i would not feel inclined to change not least in fact most of all for the reasons which my noble friend lord renton gave <e> <s> nevertheless i have listened to what has been said and we shall consider it <e>", "<cs> having listened very carefully to the most interesting speeches that have been made on this subject it seems to me that this is where i came in many years ago <e> <s> as in all discussions of this kind there is merit in all the points that have been made because it is not just this government that is concerned about direct labour organisations as such <e> <s> in cipfa came out with a report which was accepted by the labour government as being sufficiently detailed and which was making the kind of recommendations that they felt ought to be taken on board to improve the accountability the accounting the dissemination of information about what was happening and many other kinds of controls upon direct labour organisations <e>", "<cs> first i hope that it will be many many years if ever before i sit on the other side of the committee <e> <s> but as far as this figure is concerned i think that the bill prescribes that there can be allowances made for inflation <e> <s> the figure of was agreed after some long discussion in another place <e> <s> it was a reduced figure <e> <s> one has to go back to the basic philosophy of what we were talking about when we debated the last clause <e> <s> again i do not see why a right kind of direct labour organisation would object or should object at all <e> <s> if it is good and efficient it should not mind going out to tender especially when we are talking of contracts of this kind <e>", "<cs> in fact we have no quarrel with the purpose of this amendment which it appears to share with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the government have no intention of putting obstacles in the way of authorities faced with the need to undertake genuine emergency works <e> <s> however this amendment is defective and would not meet its proposed objective <e> <s> there is nothing in the clause or possible in regulations made under it that could absolutely prevent authorities from carrying out emergency works or a statement to that effect is not necessary <e> <s> the subject of the noble lords concern is presumably the conditions which may be imposed on the undertaking of works by local authorities <e> <s> let me assure him that we do not intend to use the power under this clause to hamper authorities ability to carry out emergency work <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could take that away to discuss with colleagues and consider as to how we might do that <e>", "<cs> what i meant so far as my noble friend lord sandford is concerned is that i would want to take away what he said and see if in fact there were any reasons why we should not do as he said that is include it in any other provisos we might bring back <e> <s> i was not certain what we might do <e> <s> i did note as the noble lord lord mishcon fairly said that the amendment was defective and i said we would take it away and have a look at it and at the same time take into account what my noble friend lord sandford said <e>", "<cs> i gladly accept my noble friends amendment <e> <s> it clarifies a difficult piece of drafting in a delicate area of policy <e> <s> we all want to be sure that tender competitions are above board and we therefore need to ensure that their results are open to scrutiny but at the same time we do not want to expose the sometimes very sensitive details which lie behind many tender offers <e> <s> we must respect tenderers commercial confidentiality or else very soon no one would tender <e>", "<cs> i say at once that the government are happy to accept the spirit and intention of the amendment <e> <s> we agree entirely that no hindrance must be put in the way of local authorities to use any means at their disposal to deal with any genuine emergency which threatens life or property <e> <s> it has always been our intention to draft the regulations under this clause so that emergency work was exempted from any competition requirement <e> <s> we should be content to see such an exemption provided for on the face of the bill <e> <s> however we have doubts about the drafting of the amendment which indeed its rather hesitant conclusion and similar occurrences seems to suggest its authors share <e>", "<cs> we have a great deal of sympathy with the objective behind the amendment which offers the chance of a useful minor simplification at the cost of no real relaxation of the accounting disciplines <e> <s> i cannot however accept the amendment as its stands for not only is it defective in its drafting but it also sets at employees a limit which is far too high to distinguish genuinely <e>", "<cs> i am not sure how much importance one really attaches to a manuscript amendment put down literally seconds before one has a chance to <e>", "<cs> i understand exactly what i am saying and the reason for saying it <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord opposite in his turn realises the implications of what is being suggested beyond the mere training question <e> <s> the training issue is one on its own <e> <s> the impact upon the costs of direct labour organisations and therefore their ability to compete on equal terms with the private sector is also a factor to be taken into account <e> <s> yes i understand exactly what i said and why i said it <e>", "<cs> the certainty with which the noble lord lord bruce presented his case almost convinced me that we should take an opposite course of action to that which we had decided to take namely to accept his amendment <e> <s> he nearly talked me out of it but i shall resist <e> <s> we hold to the principle of separate accounting for each of the four distinct areas of direct labour activity set out in clause <e> <s> it is essential that an authority should keep clearly in mind the purposes for which it runs a direct labour organisation and should not think of itself as a general building contractor <e> <s> if certain sorts of work can be done more cheaply and effectively by private contractors councils should not attempt to carry them out by direct labour subsidising losses by transfers from more efficient operations in other sectors <e> <s> thus the separation of the accounts according to the four types of activity should ensure that ratepayers and councillors can see where there is danger of this happening and the provision in clause that a rate of return has to be earned separately on each activity should check it when it does <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that observation and we will pass it forward <e>", "<cs> to take first the last point that the noble lord lord bruce of donington made asking me not to be adversely influenced by the way in which he puts the matters may i say to him that it is not easy but i will do my best <e> <s> first i too gladly speak to the three amendments together nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> this amendment seeks to blur the focus of the scrutiny to which direct labour organisations will be exposed by removing the requirement to calculate a separate rate of return for each of the four broad categories of construction work as set out in clause <e> <s> this amendment would allow authorities to conceal inefficiencies and to ignore the true costs of continuing to maintain direct labour establishments in areas of activity where their involvement is uneconomic <e>", "<cs> with respect i wrote it down as the noble lord said it and i am sure that <e>", "<cs> it is one thing compelling or asking or obliging them to show it is another expecting within prudent accountancy that they would have the apportionments themselves <e>", "<cs> on the latter point it seems that one cannot win <e> <s> if one does not put it in then it is said that one is making no allowance for it and if one does put it in then it is said to be rather strange <e> <s> knowing that my noble friend is always helpful in matters like this and that he too is a member of the same honourable profession as the noble lord opposite one would have to be concerned and to listen carefully to what has been said on their professional side outside their position within this house <e> <s> the basic point is still the fundamental one that is what are we trying to do with this <e> <s> because we conceded the previous amendment on the capital side of it should not be held against us in that in trying to be helpful there we recognise what we try to seek at the end of the day and that is the accountability the bringing into the open of what is happening <e> <s> that is the important thing that should concern us <e> <s> i understand the point on how sifca feel about it <e> <s> to the best of my knowledge i hope i am putting it right they suggest that this can work <e> <s> in discussions we have had with them i would not want to say that they were expressing great enthusiasm but they <e>", "<cs> there seems to be some confusion about what we are trying to achieve by asking for these rates of return <e> <s> the calculation will yield an economic measure of dlo performance <e> <s> we are not simply trying to make dlos earn some kind of artificial profit at the expense of other departments of the authority <e> <s> that would be pointless <e> <s> we are not even trying in this proposal to even up the competition between public and private building organisations by loading dlo charges with an element to balance the private firms need to allow for a profit margin <e>", "<cs> i accept that entirely because it is not the main thrust of the points i am trying to make <e> <s> i thought that the noble lords point about the district auditor was interesting but the role of the district auditor has been discussed and questioned and has been the cause of some concern for a long time concern not so much about what they do but about what they do not do not by way of not examining because that they certainly do but by way of not bringing out into the open all that is going on <e> <s> the noble lord may know that this is the subject of a great deal of discussion so that we can enhance the role of the district audit service perhaps working it together with other bodies which are looking at value for money exercises and so on <e> <s> i do not want to go into that just now <e> <s> certainly it is an area which has been looked at very carefully but in no way would i consider that it would replace that which we are requiring local authorities to do <e>", "<cs> i have not the slightest intention of being drawn into that area <e> <s> i am dealing with this matter which is the one upon which i have spoken <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to raise his other point in other ways i am sure that he has many opportunities to do so <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could cover that point and then the noble lord could continue <e> <s> of course consultations have taken place <e> <s> i myself was not a party to them so i cannot say what they were about <e> <s> but it is always open in any case at any time for there to be discussions with the ama indeed separately with the ama i see no reason why there should not be discussion with any local authority association <e> <s> it does not always have to be <e>", "<cs> i said earlier that it was not easy did i not <e> <s> let us get a few things straight about this matter <e> <s> first these amendments nos <e> <s> and seek to limit the power of the secretary of state to call for a special report to those circumstances explicitly set down under the bill or its orders or directions <e> <s> this is too narrow <e> <s> there could be other circumstances where the spirit if not the letter of the legislation is being broken <e> <s> for example there could be a persistent failure to choose the lowest tenderer under clause or taking another example entirely there could be such a margin of failure by a dlo that a special report became imperative before matters got out of hand <e>", "<cs> if i may continue and as i go along i shall try to come to the point that the noble lord has mentioned <e> <s> i have listened for i think an hour and a half to the debate on this matter and i feel that the committee would expect me to reply in the manner in which i wish to do so <e> <s> the fact is that the government cannot permit any chipping away of the three-year period and for the moment i am sticking to the amendments even though the debate has ranged much beyond them over which a dlos performance should be judged <e> <s> we are here speaking of ratepayers money tied up in a dlo risk capital you might say involuntarily collected and applied <e> <s> the period must be as short as reasonably practicable <e> <s> shareholders in a company would be asking their directors to report if things went wrong in a shorter time span than that <e> <s> of course it would be open to a local authority to include such mitigating circumstances as it thought fit and that is why the reports are being asked for before the secretary of state would consider any stiffer action <e> <s> but surely three years is long enough <e>", "<cs> yes that is exactly what i am saying <e> <s> i am not going to go over it all again <e> <s> i think your lordships know that my own views are not in accord with many of those expressed <e> <s> i believe that what we are seeking to do in this part of the bill is absolutely essential and must be done but if we are talking about that aspect of it then yes of course i say that and that i will do <e>", "<cs> i feel we cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> it is essential that the secretary of state should exercise his powers to restrict a dlos activities only after he has given them a fair chance to explain themselves and to justify their operations as far as they can <e> <s> this amendment would remove the requirement that the secretary of state should give an authority that chance and would allow him to close down a dlo on the sole grounds that the target rate of return had not been met <e> <s> failure to earn the proper return will always be serious but it will not always be the only criterion <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend would feel able to withdraw his amendment i think we ought to look at this wording generally to see whether in fact we can cover what i must say sounded to me to be the very fair points that were being made <e> <s> i am not sure because we are now speaking concerning the legal niceties as to whether or not i can in fact come back with something different but i think the points made have as they seem to me sufficient validity for me to be able to say this and that i do <e> <s> if my noble friend is able to withdraw his amendment i in turn will undertake to have a look at this wording to make sure that we are covering these aspects <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord would be so kind as to give way i do not want to mislead the committee at all <e> <s> i said i could not accept the amendments in question <e> <s> i said in relation to the specific subsections which referred to the powers of the secretary of state that i felt we should look at that wording but i did not say that i accepted the amendments at all and i should not like the noble lord to be under a misapprehension <e>", "<cs> this amendment would exempt from part ill of the bill those labour forces employed by local authority port undertakings <e> <s> the argument is that these workforces are integral parts of the ports operational staff and that the undertakings as a whole are already subject to competitive stimulus and to the requirement to act as commercial businesses and that the requirements of this part of the bill are thus in substance already met as far as they are concerned <e> <s> we accept that argument and we therefore accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not going to say too much on this <e> <s> we have had such a lot of debate on this whole area that i am not going to go over it all again <e> <s> i understand there are five new towns in scotland and i confirm that the proposals apply to them <e> <s> there is no reason why it should not be so <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord ross of marnock has had the notes on clauses which we made available <e> <s> that explains the definition of the development body <e>", "<cs> if i may i will also speak to amendments nos <e> <s> b and d <e> <s> i have to say that the amendments are not acceptable because first no <e> <s> b would permit an increase only in the number of operatives at which exemption was granted and would permit no tightening up <e> <s> we can see no merit in this as it is our view that is the appropriate level at which exemption should begin <e> <s> although once authorities have become used to operating the system there may be some case for extending it to embrace more authorities we foresee no circumstances in which we shall want to retreat <e> <s> there should be no loosening of controls over dlo expenditure <e>", "<cs> when i spoke to the amendment of my noble friend lord sandford i touched on this amendment <e> <s> i fear that the noble lord will be disappointed because we cannot accept his amendment <e>", "<cs> i invite the committee to consider the purposes for which the order-making power under this clause are designed and the conditions under which it may be used <e> <s> it is very much a reserve power <e> <s> it will allow the secretary of state to repeal any part of a local act of parliament whose provisions are inconsistent with this one <e> <s> this provision is a standard one <e> <s> there is nothing unusual about this <e> <s> it is in fact a perfectly proper way of ensuring that new requirements determined on by parliament prevail over <e>", "<cs> talk about persuasiveness <e> <s> my goodness me <e> <s> in the light of what the noble lord lord mishcon and my noble friend have said of course i will have a look at it <e> <s> i cannot accept this as it is now but we will have a look at it read what has been said think very carefully about it and see what we might or might not do <e>", "<cs> i must say that i remain unconvinced that authorities really need another two years to get ready to implement proposals based on principles expounded and accepted as long ago as <e> <s> they had fair warning of our intention last august when we said in our consultation document that we were aiming to bring the new system into operation for the financial year <e> <s> the broad outlines have thus been clear for a long time <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for spotting this typographical error and for bringing forward an amendment to correct it <e> <s> the government of course accept it and i repeat that i am most grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i am glad the noble lord lord evans made that last point because although it was meant in jest nevertheless there has been much concern about what some authorities classify as approved duties and i am sure there are many of which probably no one in this committee would approve <e> <s> obviously i have sympathy for the aims of the amendment and my noble friend lord sandford put the point fairly and well for extending the discretion of local authorities to <e>", "<cs> all i can say to the noble baroness is that i hear what she says <e> <s> i can make no comment on it at this point <e>", "<cs> the recommendation of robinson was on that very point that the amounts of money should vary in accordance with the population <e> <s> it was the main criterion the committee set down as to exactly how much <e> <s> i take the point <e> <s> one can have as much work to do in a sparsely populated and yet very widespread authority as in the opposite and so i am sure that ought to be thought about <e> <s> on the point about the opposition leaders that is entirely up to the discretion of the local authority itself <e> <s> i would entirely agree with the noble lord lord evans that it is awful in those authorities which insist on one-policy committees and there are plenty of them round the country <e> <s> personally i think it is dreadful <e> <s> in any authority i was ever involved with we never had anything of that kind <e> <s> to me the simplest thing was to involve the opposition <e> <s> then one had drawn the teeth in any case all the time <e> <s> i always thought it was a matter of good tactics apart from good sense that it be seen that there was not an attempt to keep out opposition <e>", "<cs> i would hope that they would extend it to hard-working ministers in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i am very sympathetic to the point that the noble lord lord mishcon makes <e> <s> in my experience i have found that authorities not of course all but most take notice of guidance of that kind <e> <s> i acknowledge for example that usually the leader of the opposition has an absolutely enormous task <e> <s> i have served in that capacity i have served in most of them and i know what is involved <e> <s> so i thank the noble lord for his suggestion <e> <s> we shall give it some thought and see whether we are able to do something of that kind <e> <s> we shall take that one away <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for as always the lucid and helpful way in which she has explained this <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord mishcon will i am sure expect i do not propose to anticipate what will be said in the debate presumably not today on the financial proposals in the bill <e> <s> the noble lord though included some of what i presume he will say then and which i shall oppose very vigorously indeed <e> <s> i disagree with him entirely as to the effect which the proposals will have on local government but i do not think that this is the moment to embark upon that argument <e> <s> i would prefer to stick <e>", "<cs> i readily acknowledge the strong and growing concern that there is against punitive rates which some councils are imposing but i must advise your lordships not to accept this new clause <e> <s> although at first sight it may appear to have some attraction a closer inspection shows the clause to be undesirable and possibly likely to have the opposite effect from that intended <e> <s> it would certainly have significant implications for local democratic responsibility for determining levels of expenditure and the tax burden that must be imposed to finance it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might reply to the debate <e> <s> we have been speaking at great length and i feel that now is the time to respond <e> <s> i should like first to deal with the point about the future of the transitional arrangements <e> <s> i think i can clear this up by saying that there is absolutely no question of the transitional arrangements and block grant running simultaneously as was suggested <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may be allowed to complete what i have to say because i shall come to other such figures and i think that they may give the noble lord the answer he wants <e> <s> if they do not of course i shall be glad to return to his point later on <e> <s> after all this is a committee stage <e>", "<cs> if i may be allowed to finish i cover that point as well in what i am about to say <e> <s> i did try to be <e>", "<cs> i thought i had touched on that too when i said that already some of the local authorities concerned have been along if you like to say here is our case <e> <s> this is what we think <e> <s> this is what we can do <e> <s> this is why we feel <e>", "<cs> this amendment is identical to one that was put down by the opposition in another place <e>

wish to add to it <e>", "<cs> i will take that point <e> <s> unsatisfactory it may be to the noble baroness and for that i apologise but <e>", "<cs> i think that what the noble baroness is suggesting is really not a starter <e> <s> you cannot say let me look through your accounts and then having done so say you are spending too much on this or that <e> <s> that would be <e>", "<cs> it is an arithmetical calculation <e> <s> i read out the chronology of events leading up to this <e> <s> we took a figure we specified p but said at the same time that we were not seeking to do merely that and

means let the local authorities feel that they may come to see us <e>", "<cs> i refrained from responding to the great temptation to discuss the london claw-back <e> <s> i have spent years discussing it <e> <s> it is technical and it is complicated <e> <s> there are those who think that it should be greater and those who think it should be less <e> <s> there can be no better case to justify the block grant than by saying that this will not be the kind of lever that will exist in the future <e> <s> there will be a single grant and the whole thing will come into the centre <e> <s> if i were in a london authority i should <e>", "<cs> i went to a lot of trouble to spell out how the arithmetic was done <e> <s> i did it slowly and carefully i am sure that when the noble baroness reads <e>", "<cs> the fact is that transport supplementary grant and national parks supplementary grant are an integral part of the overall rate support grant system <e> <s> at present that system is administered on a combined england and wales basis by the secretary of state for the environment and the minister of transport <e> <s> this arrangement is inconsistent with the secretary of state for waless general responsibility for local government in wales <e> <s> it is right therefore that he should be able to administer the rate support grant system for welsh local authorities and take account of the particular circumstances in wales <e> <s> this bill will enable him to do so <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would require separate tsg arrangements in england and in wales to be identical in every respect <e> <s> such a requirement really would make no sense of the separate ministerial responsibilities for england and wales and takes no account of the differing circumstances in the two countries <e> <s> it is only by allowing for different treatment that the different needs circumstances and <e>", "<cs> any decision to abolish or amend the scope of tsg will depend on the ability of block grant to reflect the need for transport expenditure <e> <s> no such decision has yet been taken <e> <s> tsg will in any event continue unchanged in england for the grant settlement <e> <s> in wales the secretary of state is currently considering the matter following consultations with welsh local authorities <e> <s> for the future however subsection provides a power to discontinue tsg by order should this prove justified <e> <s> without such a power in this bill further primary legislation would be necessary to do so <e> <s> however the committee will have noticed that under subsection any order made would be subject to affirmative resolution procedure <e> <s> this will provide the opportunity for discussion of any order which is put forward <e>", "<cs> i hope i can persuade my noble friend lord gainford that this amendment is not necessary <e> <s> an identical amendment was suggested at committee stage in another place but was not agreed to <e> <s> the minister of transport and the secretary of state for wales have made clear that it is still too early to say whether or not tsg will continue in the longer term after block grant is introduced <e> <s> as part of the development work for block grant those parts of local transport expenditure which are presently grant-aided by tsg are being examined to see if it is possible to take account of them through block grant alone <e> <s> however it has been concluded that tsg will continue in england at least for the proposed first year of operation of block grant <e>", "<cs> not for one moment would i dare to suggest that <e> <s> i think that the puzzlement is very fairly based because as i said earlier there are yet to be decisions taken <e> <s> for that reason this is to some extent an open situation and i tried to put it in that way <e> <s> i cannot reply to the noble lord lord underhill because i do not have the answer <e> <s> but it goes without saying that i will certainly get it for him <e>", "<cs> as i said a moment ago we are glad to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> first i am sure that the noble lord lord evans of claughton will not be surprised when i say that i do not take his point about the block grant not having a single friend anywhere <e> <s> all i would say is how wrong can you be <e> <s> i am certainly not going to be drawn into a general debate on rates but it is no secret as the noble lord said that we are indeed looking into alternatives <e>", "<cs> i do not know the second of the publications to which the noble lord lord greenwood of rossendale has referred although i do know the first <e> <s> however may i assure him that of course there must be more debate <e> <s> no one is going to pretend that in block grant we have the answer to this complex area

look not only in this country we should look everywhere and do everything to get something which will be agreed and which will give us a better result <e> <s> for that reason i take the point which the noble lord very properly made <e>", "<cs> i think it must be said that the basic supposition is not new and i am sure the noble lord lord evans would not claim that it is <e> <s> it is already in the pool of thinking what is interesting is the detailed way in which he puts it forward <e> <s> one can then see whether if the overall principle is not acceptable there may be an aspect of it which is helpful and that is why i welcome the fact that these amendments have been put forward <e>", "<cs> if i may make a quick comment on the block grant as opposed to the scottish system the situations are not exactly alike <e> <s> the scottish system is much smaller and much simpler and i do not think one can draw comparisons in any way between the two <e> <s> a system like that in scotland can only work as it does where it is that much smaller <e> <s> we know that the existing rsg system in england and wales is over-complex defective and not susceptible to <e>", "<cs> i spoke to this when we were dealing with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> there is nothing that i can add that would be new <e> <s> the fact is that we believe that a workable system has been developed which will allow an equitable grant distribution to be made for the next financial year <e> <s> of course development work will continue <e> <s> as with any new system there will be some rough edges which will need improvement once the system is in operation <e> <s> but to defer it would be running away from the problem <e> <s> we feel it really must be placed at the earliest practicable moment and we feel that moment has arrived and that is why we cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope i did not give the wrong impression <e> <s> i said that we were looking at the whole rating system <e> <s> i said that i recognised that block grants would probably not be the final solution i dislike using the term to grant distribution but certainly we would expect that it would last for some time until we come up with something better <e> <s> it is not just the department everyone is looking at this question and it is part of a great debate <e> <s> but this is as it is at the moment and we would not want to defer this <e>", "<cs> dinner was very good but i feel i cannot do that <e> <s> when the noble baroness refers to consultations i can only repeat that i hope they will go on at all times but we have to stand on a <e>", "<cs> my note says that we have had a thorough debate on this <e> <s> in fact we did have a thorough debate on the earlier amendment when many noble lords expressed their views and their concern and i understand that <e> <s> what surprises me most about the whole issue is that it is talked about as if what we have at the moment really is a tremendous system that does everything that we would like it to do when anyone who has been in local government at all in recent years knows what a dreadful thing it really is at present <e> <s> it is so complicated that i am not ashamed to say that despite having been involved for many years in local government finance and being leader of a key and major authority i do not know exactly how it works <e> <s> i know the principles of it and if i do not i suspect that there are others of your lordships who also do not <e> <s> for that reason i am always surprised that in this whole debate <e>", "<cs> as for the remarks of the noble lord lord davies of leek i must say come on now <e> <s> <e> <s> i read the papers as well <e> <s> when the time comes that the noble lord believes them any more <e>", "<cs> they may fail to do so for the noble baroness but lam most concerned that they should not fail so far as my noble friends are concerned <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> paragraph of schedule of the lotteries and amusements act is an amendment to section of the local government act which defines relevant expenditure for the purpose of rate support grant <e>", "<cs> it is an interesting point that is raised but in fact it is a very big amendment that we have in front of us <e> <s> the new paragraph <e>", "<cs> i should like to put right something the noble lord lord evans said when he stated that the parish councils had nowhere to turn <e> <s> they do have a right to levy a local rate themselves <e> <s> it is very limited but it does give them some scope <e> <s> it is always a joy to listen to the noble lord lord greenwood <e> <s> i hope that he can square away what he said with his ama colleagues when he sees them <e> <s> i am sure they will be asking him a lot of questions tomorrow about that <e>", "<cs> i would say touche to that <e> <s> as the noble baroness said my yorkshire compatriots did come to see me <e> <s> it is very nice when people feel so fervently about an issue that they take the trouble to come not once but twice attending and listening <e> <s> that really makes one want to do something to be helpful <e> <s> i know the problem very well <e> <s> in my own former authority we found ourselves <e>", "<cs> the south kirkby lads are certainly not supporters of the conservative party <e> <s> with respect i do not think that is the issue <e> <s> what matters is whether this is the right thing

feel about it <e> <s> is their attitude a fair one <e>", "<cs> first as to the point about the secretary of state making a judgment there is nothing sinister or new in this <e> <s> it has always been the procedure <e> <s> the basic criteria and the statistical information used will be the same as he has always had <e> <s> to the best of my knowledge that is the basis upon which these matters are computed <e> <s> paragraph of the schedule requires the local authority associations to be consulted before any amounts are fixed by the secretary of state under paragraphs and and i say again that this is absolutely the normal procedure <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend rightly says this follows an aspect of block grant which was debated at some length in another place when my right honourable friend said that we were sympathetic to the principle in question <e> <s> therefore i welcome the amendment and indeed the others to which my noble friend has just spoken <e> <s> yes we accept them <e>", "<cs> this amendment hangs together with the earlier amendment moved by the noble lord to clause <e> <s> as i explained in the debate on that amendment the proposal would change the basis of calculating authorities entitlements to block grant from their actual expenditure on the provision of services to the revenue they plan to raise <e> <s> i am interested in the point mentioned by the noble lord as to the point at which a local authority would actually have this grant <e> <s> would it be conclusive until after the grant year <e> <s> i should have thought that that was not so but because i am not certain i should like to take it away and look at it to be sure that in fact it would not present any problems <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has argued that it would be an absurdity if authorities that have increasing populations were to experience a decline in the grant and the amendment is designed to prevent this from happening <e> <s> it would be an absurdity if block grant was paid out on the basis of so much per head of population but it is not <e> <s> as i have explained to the committee on a number of occasions block grant is an equalising grant designed to enable authorities to provide a comparable level of services for a similar rate in the pound in other words to even out differences in needs and resources <e>", "<cs> i would only say to my noble friend that i had no doubt that there would be solidarity in cambridge i would expect nothing less <e> <s> as regards the point that she makes yes i think that it is quite true <e> <s> on the other hand there is a resource effect of an increase in population as well <e> <s> but at the end of the day what we are really saying is that if equalisation is the name of the game and it is are population numbers given as much weight in the calculations as they should be and that i have said i shall look at but not within the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to ensure that an authoritys assessed standard expenditure shall not differ from its actual expenditure by more than per cent <e> <s> in short it seeks to establish a link between actual expenditure and standard expenditure even more consistent than that which obtains between expenditure and assessed needs under the present system <e> <s> that is precisely the link which we have said we want to break <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord asking for a definition of relevant expenditure <e>", "<cs> relevant expenditure is that expenditure which an authority undertakes which excludes the specific grants which it receives or the charges which it makes <e> <s> that is its relevant expenditure <e> <s> if that does not help the noble lord very much i fully understand but i suspect that from the experience that he has had in local government it will in fact tell him what he wants to know <e> <s> as with all these definitions they are very complicated <e> <s> in fact one needs to understand the language even to know quite what they mean one must know the jargon <e> <s> i entirely sympathise unless one has had to work with it for years one does not know it <e> <s> however that is what relevant expenditure is as opposed to general expenditure <e>", "<cs> the best thing that i can do to help the noble lord is to send him if he will promise to read it a long treatise on the whole subject of all the different types of expenditure and exactly what they mean <e>", "<cs> no that is not so <e> <s> there is a definition within the bill itself of relevant expenditure but it is in <e>", "<cs> i do not think in practice that this will be a problem <e> <s> even if he does not read it i shall still feel obliged to send to the noble lord some details on this point and i think he will find them interesting <e>", "<cs> with permission i too will deal with both amendments <e> <s> the noble baroness lady stedman argued that clause governing the use of multipliers to adjust block grant entitlement was too broad and gave the secretary of state too much power <e> <s> that point has been put to us before and in response the government successfully moved an amendment in another place to make it clear that multipliers could be used only to increase an authoritys entitlement to block grant except in the case where it would otherwise receive an unreasonably large increase in its grant and i would have thought this was a reassuring and helpful concession <e> <s> nevertheless i understand the noble baronesss concern that the clause is still not sufficiently specific <e> <s> i have to say however that the terms of the amendment in her name are too restrictive <e> <s> it specifies three uses for multipliers which i grant are likely to be the main uses but by definition everything else is excluded <e> <s> it would be imprudent on grounds simply of good administration of the new system to accept that amendment <e>", "<cs> no i do not think that i should be drawn on london as an issue on its own <e> <s> during the seven or eight hours that i have been listening to <e>", "<cs> there is nothing to stop any noble lord doing that at report in any case but i am rather anxious that we do not build up for ourselves at the report stage an enormous problem by way of workload <e> <s> i suggest that we accept my noble friends amendment and perhaps the noble baroness and my noble friend will decide to look at the matter further of course they will do that in any case <e> <s> but may we leave it at that for the moment <e>", "<cs> the case of the isle of wight raises issues which go to the heart of the rate support grant system <e> <s> it has always been a cardinal principle of rate support grant that the grant must be distributed on the basis of general principles applied to all authorities <e> <s> this has been the case under the existing system and will continue to be the case under block grant <e> <s> any departure from this principle will open the door to innumerable claims for special <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord is talking about is a factor a criterion that should go into the calculations of what the grant should be <e> <s> i do not think that i can tell him offhand what notice is taken of a factor like that <e> <s> it is one which will apply only in certain cases <e> <s> i was about to say that i shall find out and write to him about it but it has now been pointed out to me that there is a special coastal protection grant <e> <s> i did not know of that <e>", "<cs> it would appear that the noble lords amendment actually relates not to block grant but to capital controls i would have thought part of the bill <e> <s> but i have to say that the noble lord has raised a complex local point which i am not in a position to answer at the moment <e> <s> i have listened very carefully to what my noble friend lord stanley and the noble lord have just said and i can only undertake to look very carefully at the record of the proceedings <e> <s> having done so and discussed it with officials of course i shall write to the noble lord and indeed to the noble lord lord avebury and my noble friend lord stanley and see what is or is not to be done about it <e> <s> i fear i cannot be more conclusive than that because we had not really picked up the point of the amendment <e> <s> it is only from what has been said now we have it that we ought to look at it <e> <s> in that case if the noble lord would feel able to withdraw his amendment i would undertake to look at it in that way <e>", "<cs> i shall do even better <e> <s> if i write to the noble lord he will then see what line we are taking and can decide what he wants to do <e> <s> the government in turn can see what they might or might not be able to do in looking at it carefully <e> <s> i think that is probably the best way to deal with it <e>", "<cs> in spite of what the noble lord lord ross says and not because of it we will do as i suggested <e> <s> i will certainly write to the noble lord lord parry and it may well be that the noble lord has raised a whole issue which requires looking at most carefully now <e>", "<cs> i can understand the concern of the noble baroness that local authorities should have the earliest possible notice of what rsg settlements mean for them <e> <s> but statutory dates for laying rsg reports before parliament and sending them to authorities after approval are not the way to go about it <e> <s> this years settlement was made on time last november <e> <s> the rsg orders and reports were printed before the end of that month for parliament <e> <s> but they were not debated and approved in the other house before mid-january <e> <s> however we did not wait until then before notifying the details of the settlement to the authorities associations and enabling each authority to know within very close limits its likely grant entitlement and this will of course continue in future <e>", "<cs> on the first point raised by the noble lord of the treasury involvement so far as i am aware it is absolutely normal and usual that the treasury should have an interest in these matters if only for macro-overall financial control <e> <s> i should not have thought there was anything sinister or wrong about that <e> <s> i should have thought it was perfectly normal <e>", "<cs> again as i said a moment ago i am extremely sympathetic because i have been in the position myself so often of wanting and needing this information in time for making local decisions <e> <s> but i could not promise my noble friend that this could be brought forward a month <e> <s> in my experience seeing it from the other side i realise what a struggle it always is to get it out at the time by which they are supposed to have it <e> <s> it is a problem and i know it but i do not think i could give any undertaking <e> <s> from todays committee i will go away and talk again to those concerned and see what can be done in any way <e> <s> but i cannot promise as i stand here that i could do what my noble friends very fairly would like to see done <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with that but i think this might also cover amendments on clauses and which actually cover amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i believe they are all covered in the same way <e>", "<cs> i should like to deal with the last matter because in a way it is a specialist one <e> <s> my information so far as the airports are concerned is that the department of trade following representations which have been made is intending to arrive at the appropriate method of ensuring that adequate resources are available for all essential capital investments at major local authority airports <e> <s> in fact that expenditure would then he covered under the category of special projects of national importance <e>", "<cs> i am not saying that at all <e> <s> what i am saying as one who has spent so much of his life working in local government and having tried to get through capital projects as we went along is that i know the frustration that exists and i suspect that much of the great pressure on members who are opposed to this comes because in fact they have not had to do the day-to-day nitty-gritty work whereas for those who have to do it it is part of their day-to-day routine <e>", "<cs> if i may just answer that point the very fact that my noble friend lord ridley was uncertain about the intentions with regard to capital receipts is very significant <e> <s> i said yesterday on the other financial proposals and i say it now that there continues to be considerable misunderstanding as to exactly what we propose <e> <s> the very fact that capital receipts can be used to the extent that they can is so important and yet when i am asked why so many people in local government still seem to be unhappy when i am so enthusiastic i must come back and use that as the basic answer that there continues to be considerable misunderstanding <e> <s> i venture to say that if the discussions that go on were more objective and more willing to look in detail at exactly what the proposals are i think we might have less misunderstanding <e>", "<cs> as far as i know clause refers to the total overall amount that will be allocated but i say again that within those sums the authority gets its first time ever opportunity to decide where its priorities are <e> <s> i hope the noble lord lord mishcon will not mind my saying that that should not be belittled it is an enormous thing <e> <s> we always wanted to spend it as we felt best we felt that we knew better than whitehall where our priorities were <e> <s> we wanted to be able to do this very thing <e>", "<cs> it is allocations or parts of allocations which can be transferred to any authority in the country at all <e> <s> that is so exciting frankly if you think about it in the opportunity it provides that i can well understand that my noble friend as an officer finds it hard to grasp in the first instance <e>", "<cs> very simply the allocations will be built up in this way <e> <s> just as now individual services and functions will make their bids <e> <s> for example an authority may say that it wants to do so much in education so much for housing so much for social services the environment and so on <e> <s> the blocks will be built up exactly as they are now into an aggregate total within what it is felt each service would like to see spent <e> <s> that will then be made into one total aggregate <e> <s> it will come as an allocation of that aggregate but the difference is that it will now be up to the authority although it will be specified as to how it is built up so much for education social services <e>", "<cs> i understand the reason behind the amendment but i do not believe that it would be of any real help to local authorities <e> <s> it would for a start introduce uncertainty about the extent of the controls <e> <s> the word improvements itself is not capable of any very precise definition although we intend to help authorities by indicating that we would not regard as an improvement anything that is required merely to keep a structure in use for its existing purpose <e> <s> but having decided broadly what is an improvement an authority would then have to decide what constituted a major improvement <e> <s> there could be no guarantee of consistency between authorities and in consequence no guarantee of consistency in the coverage of the control or the reporting of expenditure or improvement works <e> <s> this would not be acceptable <e>", "<cs> this amendment would remove from control under this part of the bill expenditure on the renewal or replacement of any capital asset and also on the installation of movable and immovable plant machinery and apparatus <e> <s> the present national accounting practice is to count expenditure on all those items as capital expenditure <e> <s> if the government were to accept these amendments a substantial loophole would be created in the control over the totality of local authorities capital expenditure as it is conventionally understood <e>", "<cs> paragraph <e>", "<cs> there is alreday an exclusion for <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the figure is the one that is there and is the one to which i am obliged to stick <e> <s> i fear i cannot go beyond that <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i gave a wrong impression there the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> no i cannot give a figure at the moment <e> <s> i knew of the figure <e> <s> i just assumed that it was there but it is not <e> <s> what would be helpful would be for me to say that when the decision is taken regarding the final figure i think we should want to see <e>", "<cs> rather unusually i should like to take separately the amendments of my noble friend and the noble lord lord hill of luton because i think there are certain aspects of them that are somewhat different <e> <s> this applies especially to the point of the noble lord lord hill about regional airports where i think there is a rather special situation <e> <s> however i entirely take the point that there is certainly a connection <e>", "<cs> trying to be helpful i have looked through but i fear i am in fact trying to take all these together the principle stands <e> <s> in fact we have others by the noble lord lord northfield as well really covering the same general point though not quite the same <e> <s> in fact they are not the same <e> <s> no i feel i cannot be helpful on this <e> <s> there are many implications that flow from it <e> <s> one of them is that one could envisage a scene where authorities would say if this is a way to try to increase our capital allocations we should be setting up more trading operations to try to earn some profits and the mind boggles at the thought of where that could lead <e> <s> another direct consequence of accepting the amendment would be that as i have said the amounts available for allocation to local authorities generally would have to be reduced to allow for the effect of uncontrolled expenditure and what effect that would have upon authorities which do not have any trading undertakings <e>", "<cs> we are on schedule attaching to clause <e>", "<cs> trying to be helpful may i say that the whole principle of using profits as my noble friend has just said is an absolutely acceptable one on its own and although i cannot accept the amendment and can give no commitment i think this is another of these areas where i should like to talk about it further with colleagues <e> <s> therefore i would give that assurance but without any commitment as i know would be understood <e> <s> if that is of any help at all that really covers the point of the amendment set down in the name of my noble friend lord ridley too <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would give way <e> <s> i am terribly anxious not to interrupt but the matters being talked about are of immense interest <e> <s> this is a committee and i think we should try to discuss these matters separately elsewhere <e> <s> we have an enormous programme yet before us on this bill <e> <s> i do not wish to be disrespectful but i wonder if the noble lord and perhaps other noble lords who might have wanted to speak on this would allow us to move on this particular point <e> <s> if it is felt that we should debate this elsewhere we can make arrangements so to do <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord would agree with that <e>", "<cs> the points that the noble lord lord bowden raises are of immense importance and the mind almost boggles when one contemplates the enormity of what has to be done <e> <s> sometimes i suspect that no one even wants to talk about it because it is such an enormous problem <e> <s> i understand the points which the noble lord lord davies of leek makes <e> <s> i have been to walsall and have seen mining subsidence there <e> <s> i know of the problems of manchester <e> <s> sometimes holes just appear in the road <e> <s> basically sewers are a problem for the water authorities rather than local authorities but that is not to say that it is just going to go away <e> <s> if everyone said oh its not my table as the waiter says nothing would ever happen <e> <s> it is very helpful that the point has been made but <e>", "<cs> i must not give a wrong impression <e> <s> there is no intention at all of bringing this to a stop <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> grant continues certainly up to and thereafter to all areas that are declared designated <e> <s> the government have taken a very open-handed way of designating <e> <s> i may be open to correction on the point i am about to make it may be that what i say will bring in lots of applications of which i know not but i do not know of areas where there really is need where there has been a refusal to designate <e> <s> this is one area where in my view there has been a very liberal approach in terms of allocation of the resources because as my noble friend has said it is a matter of major national importance <e>", "<cs> i welcome the opportunity because it illustrates the point that came from the debate we had before <e> <s> there is so much misunderstanding or lack of knowledge for whatever reason and there is no point in going into why that is now that it leads to the fears and anxieties that were expressed before <e>", "<cs> when making the application it will be for the authority to make its case and the total allocation that it will eventually get if its case is a good one will be higher to take into account that very point <e>", "<cs> i had better say for the record if the case is made <e> <s> it will be adjudicated upon by those who come to those decisions <e>", "<cs> i must say that the contribution of the noble lord lord northfield was extremely interesting and important <e> <s> i am glad that he made the point about the necessity for clarification <e> <s> the intention of government is by no means to restrict especially the areas that he mentioned or to which the noble lord lord seebohm referred <e> <s> in his letter to the newspaper lord seebohm automatically assumed what the allocations would be <e> <s> he said that there would not be sufficient allocations <e> <s> but how did he know that there would not be sufficient allocations <e> <s> on what did he base that supposition <e> <s> presumably it was a fear that he had and if he had expressed it as a fear that would have been fair <e> <s> but to say that it will not be sufficient was rather jumping the gun <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> of course i do know the committee and what it is doing <e> <s> i cannot give the answer to the question which has been asked but i take very much the point <e> <s> in that it is a cause of concern to the extent that the noble lord suggests i will go and talk to sir wilfred and put this to him <e> <s> i will find out <e>", "<cs> heaven forbid that i should say that the executive in question was ignorant <e> <s> but yes he does misunderstand he does not know <e> <s> the fact is i have said it several times today that capital receipts are an extra on top of the allocations <e> <s> that applies to receipts you may now have in a capital fund and to those which you may come to have if you decide to acquire them <e> <s> therefore what can i say <e> <s> when a chief officer of the standard to which my noble friend refers does not know and recently then surely i am right again when i say that it is not the bill which is at fault it is not the intention on this aspect of it which is at fault but the understanding of it <e> <s> where the responsibility lies for it not being understood is another matter entirely <e> <s> i do not seek to place the blame for that upon the chief executive concerned or upon anyone else <e> <s> i think it just highlights the point that everybody involved had better make sure that there is proper understanding about the intentions <e>", "<cs> i should say regarding the burns committee that i have been notified that the report is with the secretary of state <e> <s> it has just gone to him <e> <s> that gives the noble lord an indication of where it is at present <e> <s> before i sit down in fairness to the chief executive to whom my noble friend referred one has to say that why he misunderstood can be understood <e> <s> what i have said today about the intentions regarding capital receipts were not in the first proposals <e> <s> that is probably <e>", "<cs> having in the past spent many years working forward budgets over periods of years wondering what the allocations would be adjusting them when we did not get what we thought we should <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that i will take very careful note of what has been said <e> <s> we will look at it closely and if there is any practical way in which we can do something as has been suggested then of course we will look at this sympathetically because i know the problem <e> <s> i cannot go further because i fear as i stand here now that it will not be possible to do all that has been requested <e> <s> but i will certainly have a look at what my noble friend and other noble lords request <e>", "<cs> i am absolutely prepared if necessary for the committee to divide on this but i did think i had said that as i stand here i do not see that it is possible for us to do as requested but i would try to ascertain if i was wrong if it was possible <e> <s> having sympathy i would look at it again <e> <s> but if i am giving the impression in any way that i am going to do something that i might not be able to do i do not want to burke the issue and have it again on report <e> <s> i would have thought there were moments when the kind of indication i have given might be considered to be acceptable because i have never taken anything away on any of the bills i have done that we have not looked at carefully <e> <s> but i do not want to store up problems for report i think we already have enough <e> <s> if we have to divide we have to divide but even if we do and whether we win or lose we will still look at it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i certainly shall let him know <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend because that is correct <e> <s> this refers to the per cent <e> <s> that is built into the bill the carry forward is something else <e> <s> so without my going through my speaking notes maybe that explanation would get the noble lord to where he wants to be without the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i briefly say that we believe that considerable flexibility is conferred by the facility for virement between services and authorities and by the ability to supplement allocations by the use of capital receipts the chance to use allocations from other authorities and so on <e> <s> but in any case the figure of per cent <e> <s> can be changed by regulation if experience were to show that that were desirable <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would give way <e> <s> it might save the noble lords throat and the committees time if i were to tell him and no doubt i hope to his pleasure that the government are prepared to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> the main objective of the new control system is to ensure that the government have the ability to contain total capital expenditure by local authorities within a national cash limit <e> <s> by its very nature a cash limit is a firm figure <e> <s> by removing the ministers power to limit the proportion of capital receipts available to supplement expenditure allocations the amendment would reduce the governments ability to safeguard the cash limit from being broken <e> <s> in the absence of this power the only recourse to prevent a national overspend would be to cut expenditure allocations to allow for the use of capital receipts <e> <s> in that any reduction in allocations would probably have to be made <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord northfield <e>", "<cs> the amendment of course would weaken the control of the total level of authorities capital expenditure <e> <s> it has to be borne in mind that the total product of the rate of p in the pound for local authorities in england and wales is about million <e> <s> that is the amount by which paragraph <e>", "<cs> of all the members of the committee the noble lord lord northfield has shown by his earlier remarks that he has an appreciation of exactly how this is proposed to work yet he indicates that at any rate for the moment he has forgotten all that <e> <s> within the allocation that is given my noble friend has the power to use his money in any way he wishes and his only problem in the first instance will be to try to get the figure as high as possible within the discussions which presumably will normally take place <e>", "<cs> or better salesmen to sell the idea <e>", "<cs> i can only repeat what i said a little earlier when the committee divided it may have the same result or it may not namely that i cannot accept the amendment for the reasons i have given <e> <s> i talked the other day about thinking aloud which is perhaps something one should not do but i do so because i sometimes find it interesting and as my noble friend lord mottistone said i am always very courteous to myself when i do so <e> <s> i cannot accept the amendment and i have explained why and if noble lords opposite feel they must divide then that must be their decision <e>", "<cs> it is easy to say yes sit down and go away but i must be absolutely frank about this <e> <s> paragraph <e>", "<cs> on the general subject we had a debate a little while ago i think it was on an amendment of the noble lord lord northfield or perhaps the <e>", "<cs> i do not know the particular document but i know within our own department what our attitude is <e> <s> i say again that i am confident that he is going to get where he wants to be in any case <e>", "<cs> dealing with the first amendment although the principles are similar it is a complex amendment <e> <s> it provides that where an authority take the lease of land which they intend to sublet for industrial use they will not in respect of the year in which they acquired that interest be treated as making any payment for so much of the land as has not been sub-let by the end of that year <e> <s> only in the following financial year will they be treated as having made payments for that un-let land <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be to exempt from control all expenditure on the acquisition of industrial land by leasing in any year insofar as the authority concerned do not sub-let that land by the end of that year <e> <s> this is quite unacceptable as it would mean that part of a local authoritys capital expenditure would not be subject to control in the year in which the expenditure was first undertaken by the authority <e> <s> this would seriously weaken the governments ability to ensure that authorities total capital spending in a particular year remained within the overall limits authorised for that year <e>", "<cs> i must in all frankness say this on the same basis as before that i cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> i thought some of the points were interesting in that they were very complex and i said i wanted to look at them again <e> <s> on that basis i hope the noble lord will feel able to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i say at once that the government are in sympathy with the intention behind the amendment which is to give authorities as much notice as possible of their capital expenditure allocations each year <e> <s> the government will of course announce the specified allocations for authorities for a particular year as early as possible and in any case well before the end of the financial year before that to which the allocations relate <e>", "<cs> i accept that there are those who would like to see the planning enforcement machinery strengthened and i also accept that it might appear wrong for statutory undertakers to be legally bound to connect services to unlawful developments <e> <s> but in fact the cases with which this amendment would deal are very rare and any problems to which they might give rise are far outweighed by the many practical difficulties that the proposal would create <e> <s> if the noble lord lord evans would be agreeable i should like to write to him on this because i have such a lengthy brief on it which outlines all the practical difficulties and i suspect that at this stage the committee would be happy if he would so agree and i shall undertake to do this <e>", "<cs> the new clauses and schedules are designed to put into effect the proposals of the previous government for giving certain district councils responsibility for education personal social services highways and so on <e> <s> it will come as no surprise when i say that i cannot accept these amendments <e> <s> it is understandable that some of the non-metropolitan districts which had been county boroughs before would like to have some of their former county borough functions restored to them but the result <e>", "<cs> the noble lord really must not tempt me in this way <e> <s> i will not say that i cannot but i had better not add anything to what i have already said <e>", "<cs> we have had a very lengthy debate on what clearly is a most important part of the bill and one which as has been shown illustrates the concern which the committee and your lordships have for this matter <e> <s> i am glad to deal together with the amendments in effect if we take in the three which my noble friend lord sandford has put forward as well as amendments to the amendment <e> <s> so let me try to deal with them all together <e>", "<cs> i consider them to be important and all that i have said i hope confirms that <e> <s> redundant no <e> <s> if they were redundant we should not be having all the trauma that we have been having in trying to get this part of the bill right <e> <s> when my noble friend asks whether they are inviolate i would say that they cannot foresee every contingency nor can they be changed quickly <e> <s> if the system is to work efficiently there must be arrangements including suitable safeguards to enable the approval of applications which depart from the structure

intend to speak again on this subject <e> <s> the noble lord raises a point which comes under amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the committee can see how the amendment numbers are now engraved in my head <e> <s> we will be discussing that <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to remove from the clause a subparagraph which gives effect to the main purpose of the whole clause <e> <s> the division of responsibility for development control has given rise to disputes between authorities to wasted work and to uncertainty for applicants and all concerned <e> <s> i touched on this in a very long debate we had a little while ago <e> <s> and at the heart of the confusion and dispute lies paragraph <e>", "<cs> the code of practice is in amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> it is written into the bill and

understand by all the parties concerned and i am quite sure that once it has been agreed to the point where it can be published my noble friend will have access to it <e>", "<cs> i am told that the state of play over the code of practice is that the local authority associations those most closely concerned initially with agreeing it have had much consultation and discussion upon it and are at the point where it has been agreed <e> <s> if it has not been agreed certainly it is not far from being agreed and when it is i am quite sure that it can be made available to any other bodies certainly to those to whom my noble friend referred <e>", "<cs> i understand that it will eventually come in the form of a circular <e> <s> that will be the time for anybody who wishes to comment upon it so to do <e>", "<cs> the effect of this clause would be as the noble lord has said to require the secretary of state to make orders to transfer from the employment of the county council to the employment of a district council any staff who became redundant as a result of the transfer of the development control function to districts under clause <e> <s> the orders would also provide for protection of their terms and conditions of employment following transfer <e>", "<cs> i still fear that i do not follow the argument at all <e> <s> first i do not see in general terms why the district authorities need to employ any more staff to do only that which they are doing now but if in certain circumstances they found that they needed to i presume that they would recruit in the normal way and i cannot think of anyone more qualified for those positions than those who had been working on similar work in counties <e> <s> obviously that would be a potential source of skilled and informed people but to lay down beforehand some rules on a hypothetical situation i should not have thought was necessary <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that that was an eminently sensible suggestion <e> <s> if my noble friend would feel happy that we should deal with the amendment in that way it would be quite convenient so far as i am concerned <e>", "<cs> i am of course a babe in arms in the way in which these things are done <e> <s> would it be possible to have a debate on the original amendments which could reach across the subject generally and then at least one will know the views of members <e> <s> if we had a debate on clause stand part which is very tempting and i personally would be very happy what would we do about the individual parts of the other amendments <e> <s> i could make it clear as we went along where the government stood on some of the other points <e> <s> i could make that clear because we have certain views now <e>", "<cs> i think that we shall probably have to go that route but i should think that in doing so inevitably general views will come out <e> <s> we shall probably have to go that way <e> <s> the problem about doing it with a debate on whether the clause shall stand part is that we shall be debating something and coming to a conclusion upon something which we should have to return to and look at in detail <e> <s> if we were to have a debate on whether the clause shall stand part and vote on it for example or have it accepted we could not do so without having taken in the individual amendments that are made <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wigoder so rightly said appeals and charges are not necessarily the same thing <e>", "<cs> i am not sure where that comes in but i understand it to mean that there will be different fees for different types of application <e> <s> indeed the actual fees themselves are proposals that are being discussed at present and will presumably continue to be discussed <e> <s> we have suggestions and proposals but they are not by any means finally concluded <e> <s> they will vary of course in the case of certain buildings on a per square foot basis <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it might be helpful if i were to speak at this time <e> <s> this is a committee stage and we can all come back again if we have to <e> <s> i think that it would be helpful if i were to make a few general observations to try to cover some of the points which my noble friend has mentioned and of course to which the noble lord lord mishcon referred <e>", "<cs> i would have hoped in the middle because then i steer clear of both sides <e> <s> that is in fact the anticipated figure <e> <s> what all the argument comes down to is one argument of principle and one argument of practicality <e> <s> the principle is is it fair that the applicant for planning permission should pay for his application <e> <s> the practicality will charges be a financial burden as my noble friend suggested a deterrent to development or even a drag on the economy <e>", "<cs> that is absolutely right <e> <s> i was going to say that the final charge will be fixed by regulation <e> <s> yes of course it can <e> <s> conversely it could also be reduced if it was felt that was the thing to do <e>", "<cs> i can say that that is so i said that earlier <e>", "<cs> i suggest that the committee must make progress and it might therefore help if i said a little about the amendment which we are discussing and perhaps we can then reach some conclusion on the matter <e> <s> this amendment is one of a number on what is a very broad subject dealing with consultations about in effect deemed consents a task which is equivalent to considering and determining planning applications <e> <s> without going into the detail which is before me perhaps i can just say that it becomes apparent that if we move too far in this direction we shall lose sight of the whole purpose of the charges which is to offset public expenditure involved in development control <e> <s> i wonder whether in the light of other points that have been made generally my noble friend may feel able at least for the time being to withdraw the amendment on the basis that he will have a chance to do something else with it later should he wish to do so <e> <s> that would enable us to move on into the generality of the whole subject <e>", "<cs> no i was asking my noble friend if he would be good enough to withdraw it at this stage <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier when we were speaking on this in the broader context there are a number of details that we will gladly talk about and people would like to do so for many reasons <e> <s> on this aspect of the proposals to charge i think we are probably not too far apart <e> <s> first we have no intention of charging for listed building consents nor for approvals required under the landscape areas special development order <e> <s> we will look again with sympathy at the circumstances in which a developer would attract a liability to charge because of an article for direction or because of the <e>", "<cs> i am open to any points that noble lords may wish to make <e> <s> i am trying to stress that this is an area where there is scope for discussion and we will see whether we ought to do something that we are not doing <e> <s> we want to know this <e> <s> this is open to discussion at the moment <e> <s> we have an open mind on this <e> <s> we want the best we can get in the best way we can get it and i would listen to any suggestions made <e>", "<cs> i wonder what the noble lord would have said as to motor cycles but that is another point <e> <s> the first point i should make is that these matters are properly left to the regulations and not to the enabling power <e> <s> your lordships will have ample opportunity to debate such points as these when the regulations which are subject to affirmative resolution of both houses are laid <e> <s> in setting a scale of charges under the powers of clause we should certainly <e>", "<cs> no at this moment i <e>", "<cs> when the noble baroness lady birk raised this point i intimated that this was an area we ought to look at on its own and that we will certainly do <e>", "<cs> i think that is a very fair suggestion and with that well in mind i will certainly take the point away and see what i can do about it <e>", "<cs> i cannot go further than i have already gone <e> <s> i believe that important points have been made <e> <s> while i cannot accept the amendment a method of work i have adopted with the many amendments i have had to different bills is to take them away and think very seriously about them <e> <s> if we feel we can meet the points made one way or another we try to do something about it <e> <s> but if i cannot do so i cannot <e> <s> then it will be for the noble lord himself to decide what to do <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the noble lords concern that we should not in charging for planning applications place excessive burdens on those who are revitalising the inner urban areas <e> <s> i am not sure that i would accept that the kinds of fees we are proposing would be a disincentive to anyone <e> <s> i say again that we are tending to get this completely out of proportion <e> <s> we are mixing the principle with the practical effects <e> <s> our aim in setting the level of charges is to ensure that they will not be a discouragement to development <e> <s> i have noted the noble lords argument <e> <s> the issue is one that we should consider in the context of <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is pretty right <e> <s> there is not a lot of difference <e> <s> i am very conscious of the risk that if we complicate the charging arrangements we shall create something which is expensive to administer the point that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter made earlier <e> <s> the noble baroness will be aware for example that <e>", "<cs> to deal with that last point first if the noble baroness lady david were saying that if i could give her an assurance that there would be such an exemption she would then support the rejection of the amendment i should be glad to answer her in detail <e> <s> as it happens i cannot give her a specific answer other than to say that in general terms i have tried to say all along when debating this issue indeed i have tried to say this when debating most subjects that if any of your lordships raised any aspect that should be looked at we would gladly do so but i suspect that this whole debate has gone much further than that now <e>", "<cs> i was not trying to say other than that <e> <s> i am sorry if i was saying something that i did not intend to say though i was not aware that i was <e> <s> in any case at the end of the day we should take all the other factors into account not least the fact that by our willingness to free entirely from planning a big section of the gdo for individuals <e>", "<cs> it is interesting that the noble lord is seeking the removal of powers of direction which the secretary of state received in section of the inner urban areas act <e> <s> the new section a which clause inserts into the act follows section quite closely <e>", "<cs> i recognise that the local authority associations have misgivings about the position when a local plan is no longer in general conformity with a newly approved or altered structure plan <e> <s> it is asserted that a provision on the lines proposed by my noble friend would remove uncertainty but i wish to bring to the attention of the committee the outcome of the discussions that have taken place with the local authority associations <e>", "<cs> again i am deeply grateful to my noble friend who really is so expert on these matters <e> <s> he must be the absolute terror of the printers and thank goodness that he is <e> <s> i am grateful to him for pointing this out to us <e>", "<cs> without making any speech on it i am grateful to the noble lord for bringing this forward <e> <s> yes we do accept it <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will be glad to know that i accept in principle what is proposed here because it is a small but none the less useful contribution to our efforts to reduce time and money spent on the preparation of structure plans <e> <s> we accept the purpose of this amendment but it does appear to be inadequate <e> <s> the changes that are needed have been identified and i would be glad to discuss with my noble friend what is required <e> <s> i would expect this to enable him to bring forward the necessary amendment at report stage <e> <s> with that perhaps he might feel able to withdraw this amendment and we will proceed in the way i have suggested <e>", "<cs> in the few words we had on amendment no <e> <s> za i welcomed the proposal to distinguish the policies in general proposals in a submitted structure plan from the explanatory material <e> <s> it is logical to extend this concept to proposals for the alteration or the repeal or replacement of an approved structure plan <e> <s> i welcome this amendment in principle <e> <s> but i understand that as drafted it will not properly achieve the necessary alterations and i would say as i said to my noble friend that i would be happy to discuss with the noble lord between now and the report stage the amendment that is needed <e> <s> with revised wording i am sure we can bring it back <e>", "<cs> i recognise that there will be occasions when proposals to alter repeal or replace a local plan adopted by the local planning authority or approved by the secretary of state will be uncontroversial and that it could well be a waste of public money to conduct an inquiry <e> <s> i also recognise that there are a number of objectors to local plans who are quite prepared to rely on their written objections and do not want to take part in an inquiry <e> <s> in other words i fully accept the principle behind my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> we will look at what my noble friend has said <e> <s> we will accept amendment no <e> <s> aa but if it should be that there is something additional along the lines of what my noble friend has said then we will consider it <e> <s> as for this amendment perhaps he would withdraw it <e>", "<cs> that does not matter <e> <s> it is when they do object in writing that this has to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend for what he has just said <e> <s> it is the thrust of what i want to say <e> <s> i would like to pay tribute to what i thought was the very clear way in which my noble friend lord stanley of alderley put his case <e> <s> my noble friends concern about the loss of high quality agricultural land is shared by myself and my right honourable friends in another place <e> <s> government policy for the protection of agricultural land is to ensure as far as possible that land of higher agricultural quality is not taken for development where land of a lower quality is available and that the amount of land taken is no greater than is reasonably required for carrying out the development in accordance with the proper standards <e> <s> there can be no misunderstanding about the recognition of the value of high quality agricultural land <e> <s> but the needs of agriculture cannot be given absolute priority without regard to other requirements of communities and hence the need for the planning system to resolve problems about the location of new development <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that my noble friend feels it necessary to refer to what i said in that way <e> <s> pious hopes well i suppose that most of life is hoping and piously is perhaps a better way of doing it than any other <e> <s> but what i <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will be glad to learn that the government support this amendment in principle <e> <s> in fact we are not able to accept it in its present form because it appears to be defective in one or two respects <e> <s> for example it does not refer to the new section a of the act inserted by this bill which provides for alterations to local plans to be proceeded with in certain circumstances in advance of related alterations to the structure plan <e> <s> there are one or two other alterations too which will be needed <e> <s> to ensure that the timing of the steps required are compatible we should like this amendment to include a provision that it would be brought into effect by order by the secretary of state <e> <s> however the defects are minimal and i would hope that my noble friend might come forward with the appropriate amendments at report stage <e> <s> i should be happy to discuss with him what appears to be required <e>", "<cs> i was merely trying to put it very nicely the other way round but what i am really saying is this <e> <s> let us by all means get together and jointly produce a form of words which will cover the point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he illustrated the point that the noble lord lord ponsonby knew i was going to make namely that there is no difference between us as to the motives <e> <s> we recognise the tremendous amount of preliminary work that was put into this even going back to by george dobry and other such eminent people who were concerned in this field <e> <s> the fact is that for whatever reason the schedule is a complex one it contains a large number of drafting errors <e> <s> therefore we could not possibly take it on at this time <e>", "<cs> i certainly undertake to speak to colleagues on this point to see where we stand with it <e> <s> there is no difference between us on leaving it <e>", "<cs> this amendment would add an additional stage to the procedure for all those planning appeals which fall to the secretary of state to decide if there has been a local inquiry <e> <s> it goes wider than the recommendation of the franks committee which was adopted in scotland that the parties should if they wished have an opportunity of proposing corrections to the factual part of the inspectors report in such cases <e> <s> the report would have to be sent in every case and would give an opportunity for submitting further argument <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to both of my noble friends for their constructive comments <e> <s> of course in that it is the governments line i feel happier with the observations of my noble friend lord colville <e> <s> from everything which i have seen and i know this only from another side i believe that anything we can do that will avoid putting another step into the proceedings must be the right thing to do <e> <s> for that reason alone i hope that my noble friend may feel able not to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> the new clause would prevent the immediate listing of buildings of special architectural and historic interest <e> <s> in consequence it would become impossible to take speedy and effective action to protect such buildings when threatened with demolition <e> <s> this problem is not solved by the related provisions of new section c to which i shall refer in a moment <e> <s> under the new section where the secretary of state proposes to list a building the owner will <e>", "<cs> i am again very grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> i should like to take it away think about it and discuss it with those who have special knowledge of this field <e>", "<cs> we are glad to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment requires the secretary of state first to consult a particular body of persons having special knowledge of buildings of interest before giving a certificate <e> <s> the historic buildings council are his statutory advisers <e> <s> they are busy people who give liberally of their valuable time <e>", "<cs> we share the noble baronesss concern to strengthen local authorities powers to require repairs to listed buildings but i fear that the proposal in its present form is not acceptable <e> <s> entering occupied premises against the wishes of the owner to carry out work is always open to the very real objection of the invasion of privacy and rights of property <e>", "<cs> i congratulate my noble friend on the eloquence with which he has introduced this amendment and i recognise that it is supported by the associations representing metropolitan authorities and district councils and by the civic trust <e> <s> my noble friend has shown all his well known qualities of assiduity and resolution and i pay tribute to his own and his supporters sincerity on the amendment because i know that they are concerned to see that conservation areas are indeed what their name implies <e> <s> it is therefore with particular regret that i find myself having to resist his amendment because however well-meaning and sincere its intentions my right honourable friend the secretary of state and i consider that the amendment is misconceived and its practical effect may well be misunderstood by my noble friend and his supporters for reasons i will try to explain <e>", "<cs> this amendment would allow redevelopment grant to be paid towards the cost of acquiring buildingsin conservation areas for refurbishment or renewal provided they were part of a redevelopment scheme <e> <s> i must point out as the noble lord has said however that grant would not be payable towards the costs of refurbishment or renewal as such <e> <s> the secretary of state already has adequate and more appropriate powers to assist the preservation or enhancement of outstanding conservation areas in section of the town and country planning amendment act and these powers are being extended to all conservation areas by the amendment in paragraph of schedule of this bill <e>", "<cs> local planning authorities have been able to designate conservation areas since <e> <s> over such areas have been designated and i am sure that most people would agree that they have made a useful contribution towards the preservation of our architectural heritage <e> <s> there are however few obligations placed on owners in conservation areas <e> <s> the only significant ones are that consent is required for the demolition of any buildings in the area whilst under section a of the town and country planning act the local authority must be notified of any intended felling of or major alteration to trees <e> <s> normal planning control is unaltered but local planning authorities are required to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of the area when exercising all their powers under the town and country planning act <e>", "<cs> yes we do accept that <e>", "<cs> i cannot give the noble baroness the assurance she wants <e> <s> i will certainly look at what she has said to find out exactly what the precise interpretation is <e> <s> as is often the case one can give an off the cuff interpretation but i prefer not to do that and in those circumstances i wonder whether she will let it go <e>", "<cs> i am really very surprised that we should be having this debate as much upon the amendment as upon the general principles <e> <s> indeed i thought that was what we should be mostly debating and that the amendment would be a lead into that <e> <s> however as a few very important points have been raised i think that i should initially cover those at least <e> <s> i say at once that for the reasons that the noble lord lord evans has just touched upon i am frankly amazed when i consider that at second reading and after all i have read and heard discussed over all the period that the udcs were ever suggested the one thing that everyone has said is that the danger is that we shall put them everywhere <e> <s> we in government have gone to great pains to say to people first that that is not the intention <e> <s> indeed my right honourable friend the secretary of state in another place in i think his opening second reading speech on the bill itself went to considerable lengths to stress that for reasons which i hope are by now known and if not i will gladly dilate upon them it was in those two specific areas that the government wanted to set up udcs and it was not at all the intention to go beyond that <e>", "<cs> we entirely accept the need for consultation as proposed in the first of the amendments but we consider it important not to make this a legal requirement since if such procedures were to form part of the main legislation they could be used to delay the establishment of udcs <e> <s> for udcs a designation procedure similar to that in the new towns act could lead to a long period of delay and uncertainty <e> <s> the need to avoid any hiatus in tackling the problems of decay in these two areas calls for quicker designation procedures than would be possible as for instance under the new towns model which includes a public inquiry and that is a procedure that can take up to two years <e>", "<cs> may i first say that of course i am well aware that the governments udc proposals have generated controversy and that leaders of some local authorities have expressed particular anxieties <e> <s> equally i think it is fair to point out that the government proposals have also attracted considerable support <e> <s> i am the first to recognise the point that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones made when speaking of london about the existing organisation under the docklands joint committee which he said had made much progress <e> <s> i entirely accept that <e> <s> i would pay tribute to it <e> <s> indeed i know something of it <e> <s> i have made it my business to find out and not for a moment do i wish in any way to detract from that <e> <s> but as i shall point out in a few moments what the government are concerned with is the scale and the rate at which progress is being made <e> <s> it is because we feel as we do about this that in a session which really is so crowded with other important business we have nevertheless thought it right to bring forward legislative provisions to enable these urban development corporations to be established <e>", "<cs> both the principles and the mechanics involved in the amendment present serious problems <e> <s> there is every intention on the part of the government to ensure that people with local knowledge and experience serve on the boards of the udcs and indeed witness the appointments that we have been talking about earlier such as those of bob mellish sir kenneth thompson as deputy chairmen of the two shadow udcs <e> <s> there can be no question of tying the membership irrevocably to a particular mix of local party politics in an area as the amendment seeks to do <e>", "<cs> there is no requirement upon new town development corporations to admit the public to their meetings and we see no reason why there should <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for what he has said <e> <s> yes we will consider that point of discretion <e>", "<cs> just to set the record straight i do not recall saying that i did not mind if powers were to be whittled away <e> <s> i think i should have said exactly the opposite <e> <s> in fact i made an impassioned appeal to noble lords opposite please not to try to whittle away the powers but to give it a chance to show what it can do <e> <s> that is why i hoped that noble lords opposite would not press any of these amendments <e>", "<cs> i do not know if there has been a misprint <e> <s> as always i listen with interest and facination to what the noble lord lord ross of marnock says and if the position is as he suggests we welcome his drawing it to our attention and will be glad to make the necessary alteration <e> <s> if it is not a misprint but is correct i am sure he will know what to say at the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i understand that indeed it is a misprint it should be parts i ii iii and iv and i am grateful to the noble lord for drawing it to our attention <e> <s> i have sympathy with the point that my noble friend raised but it does not detract from the fact that the noble lord is correct and that we should gratefully accept that fact <e>", "<cs> to the best of my knowledge it is not normal to supply notes on amendments <e> <s> we have tried to do so in this bill because we have recognised its great complexity <e> <s> where we have had them we have gladly provided them <e> <s> i will try to do what the noble lord requests if i have them <e> <s> if i have not i know that he will understand <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can add much to what i said earlier <e> <s> this is a fundamental part of the proposals <e> <s> we debated them fully and divided on them <e> <s> they were accepted by the committee and this part is equally fundamental <e> <s> i have to ask that the clause does stand part <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to restrict the udcs to operating the london building legislation inner london rather than the national building regulations <e> <s> we accept that there may be a good case for allowing this to happen but we consider it important to provide the flexibility for the udc to operate either the london or the national regulations <e> <s> it is not yet clear whether building control functions need to be transferred to the udcs <e> <s> there may be circumstances in <e>", "<cs> if you have the alternative and that situation happily comes about one day they can indeed apply the london regulations they have the option <e>", "<cs> that with respect is not the point <e> <s> the udc might need these powers if it were to take on a housing improvement role say within the urban development area <e> <s> as with an order made under clause the order transferring any powers under this clause would be subject to affirmative resolution and the powers would be exercised by the udc instead of the local authority or even concurrently with the local authority depending on the terms of the order <e> <s> powers would of course not be needed unless it were decided that an order giving say local authority housing functions to a udc were necessary <e> <s> it is really a kind of reserve power in case it proved to be necessary <e>", "<cs> in fact i should be rather surprised if they were to set up separate operations of the type referred to <e> <s> clearly this is where the whole area of working in conjunction with the local authorities applies <e> <s> i do not see that there is any conflict in what we are seeking to do here by giving powers should it be necessary <e> <s> it is technically necessary and i do not think it is at all sinister as the noble baroness may fear <e>", "<cs> there is a distinct likelihood indeed i should have thought almost a certainty that they would do just as the noble baroness suggests <e> <s> with things such as issuing certificates and powers to make loans to meet expenditure alterations to buildings and powers to make grants towards the cost of thermal insulation of buildings i should not have thought that there was anything there to give cause for concern <e>", "<cs> now i understand what an illustrious predecessor meant when he used the phrase intoxicated by the exuberance of his own verbosity <e>", "<cs> the fact is that when all the rhetoric has died down and all the drama is finished what we are talking about here is giving to the udcs who may well need to exercise housing improvement functions and the like certain powers which would not go to the udcs in any event other than by specific affirmative orders which at the end of the day rest with parliament <e> <s> either one accepts that udcs are going to have a chance to do the job or one does not <e> <s> as i said <e>", "<cs> i do not want to drag this matter out <e> <s> the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead said that i should keep on trying to convince him well i do keep on trying but it seems that i very rarely succeed <e> <s> but i shall keep on trying <e> <s> the fact is that as regards housing and indeed the other powers that we seek to give to the udcs there will be certain functions which will continue to stay with the local authorities entirely and they have been specified <e> <s> i do not want to go into all that again <e> <s> but the fact is that hopefully there will be co-operation indeed if there is not co-operation then as i have said two or three times today i think that the udc <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was not present when i touched on that point a little while ago when i said that we have tried to give everything that we have got on this bill including both notes on clauses and notes on amendments <e> <s> to the extent that we have them we shall see that any noble lord who wishes can have them as well <e> <s> we would keep on doing that right through to the end of the bill <e> <s> so if we have anything it is available to noble lords as well <e>", "<cs> i must say that at this hour after all the hours in six days and six nights the hectoring tone of the noble lord lord bruce is not really conducive to making me want to make any kind of response to him <e> <s> yes i am getting on with it <e> <s> but the fact is that i really do not take kindly to that kind of hectoring at this time of night and i have not the slightest intention of bringing forward the kind of amendments to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> i will simply say that part iii allows the secretary of state to direct the necessary detail <e> <s> the accounts will be audited by external auditors and will also be subject to the comptroller and auditor general <e> <s> the intention is to have very full accounts <e>", "<cs> not for the first time in matters of this kind during the passage of the committee stage of this bill i am grateful to the noble lord lord northfield for having put the points so well that i had intended to make <e> <s> i think we must accept right from the beginning that this is an attempt at an <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that this is the moment at which we should be talking about this <e> <s> i think we should recognise that this is going to be a costly <e>", "<cs> i am terribly tempted to say need i say more <e> <s> as to the noble lords plug for his application or wish i can only say i hear what you say <e> <s> of course that will be done in another place in another way <e> <s> i have noted down some splendid points to make but frankly i do not see there is any point in making them because the noble lord has put the case so well <e> <s> there is an absolute wish here for a total involvement in this matter by the local authorities <e> <s> this thing is never going to get anywhere if the local authorities do not want to do it and we have no intention at all of pressing anyone to do it <e> <s> in regard to the new town development corporations and so on whatever i said would simply repeat what the noble lord has said and in those circumstances i wonder if the noble lord lord ponsonby may feel able to withdraw his amendment <e> <s> i will go into more detail if noble lords would like me to do so <e>", "<cs> it will have been seen from those already designated that the clear emphasis obviously is to the local authorities the districts concerned <e> <s> that must be a priority <e> <s> but to take statutory steps to exclude as this does would be wrong <e> <s> at the end of the day the priorities the decisions must be based on a judgment <e> <s> to exclude the opportunity for new town development corporations and the others to have their chance to make their case is further than we ought to go <e> <s> that is really all i am saying <e>", "<cs> may i say <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord would allow me it might be helpful if i were to tell him straight away that we are prepared to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i remain firmly in my seat <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that this was arguably one of the most difficult aspects of the proposals some would say the most difficult aspect of the proposals but speaking to the specific amendments these amendments would exclude businesses with more than square metres of retail floor space from the rating exemption <e> <s> that would give rise to practical difficulties <e> <s> there would be for example a powerful incentive for retailers to try to subdivide their activities in some artificial way so that they might become separate and smaller units <e> <s> this surely would be a recipe for litigation uncertainty and possibly even waste <e> <s> however i know that a number of <e>", "<cs> my information is that the way to deal with that situation would be by planning restrictions and <e>", "<cs> there is in fact already a scheme for the payment of compensation to local government staff who are made redundant or lose their jobs in the interests of greater efficiency <e> <s> this scheme which was extended to cover new town staff was agreed between management and unions and is at present embodied in a departmental letter published in march <e> <s> the scheme is in process of being converted into regulations which it is hoped can be made later this year <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend that it is an unnecessary restriction to require action areas to be indicated in structure plans before action area local plans can be prepared to propose the comprehensive treatment of an area <e> <s> unfortunately however the amendment goes only part of the way <e> <s> there ought also to be corresponding amendments in schedule to the act so that the changes extend to greater london <e> <s> i fear that all this is rather more complex than my noble friend might at first have imagined <e> <s> but i assure him that my right honourable friends and i welcome the change in principle and we wish to consider it carefully <e>", "<cs> i think many of those interested in the structure and local plan system recognise that too much time has been taken to prepare these plans <e> <s> the town and country planning act requires authorities responsible for a local plan to arrange public participation in the preparation of the plan and to consider objections to the plan proposals <e>", "<cs> i respond to the noble lord lord mishcon with equal seriousness <e> <s> your lordships have heard the argument he has put and ours to the point of weariness and strongly though the government feel on this issue i do not think your lordships would welcome hearing it all again <e> <s> on his amendment i will say this <e> <s> the long title of a bill according to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might comment first on what the noble baroness lady birk said which i felt was really rather more of a general speech on the governments housing and economic policies than on the statement itself <e> <s> if i may pick up the points that she made i think what we must either accept or not accept right from the beginning is whether or not a cash limit is sacrosanct <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the position of wales and scotland is an entirely separate matter for the secretaries of state there <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very easy to make a point that sounds so clever <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be allowed to respond the noble baroness asked me whether i was aware <e> <s> of course i was not aware that that phone call had been made <e> <s> i am not sure of the significance of a particular authority being called by my department <e> <s> it must be that they have some very special line into the authority <e> <s> i really do not know why and i truly do not appreciate the significance of the point made <e>", "<cs> my lords i come back to my first point <e> <s> either we believe that a cash limit is what it says or we do not <e> <s> if we do and say that this is what the country can afford on this item of expenditure it is surely not wrong for a government seeing an indication of a very considerable overspend to want to say you must look at it because you cannot exceed it <e> <s> there aint any more money for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on the individual figures that my noble friend mentioned <e> <s> but i think it ought also to be said that if when we have the information required it proves that the figure is not to be that then the government will decide what they have to do <e> <s> but i do not consider it at all unreasonable to call for the information and that is what this circular does in the form that it does and within the time that it does <e> <s> i think it is essential <e>", "<cs> my lords i am responding to this and i cannot make any comment on scotland <e> <s> i have no information at all and i do not want to start to conjecture on that <e> <s> i am sorry but what was the noble lords first point <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> clearly we hope to have the information by st october <e> <s> as soon as we get it we will immediately start to analyse it and see exactly what it shows <e> <s> of course there will be a decision to be taken as to where we stand once we see exactly what it means <e> <s> as i said if it proves that the indicators are wrong then we shall know how to act <e> <s> but of course another announcement will be made based upon the outcome of what we find <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no intention whatsoever to stop building <e> <s> the intention is that the billion which has been allocated for housing <e>", "<cs> my lords when the allocations were first made in february the needs and requirements of authorities were then considered and allocations were made based upon that <e> <s> it is those figures which it is still important that authorities spend not more than that but not less than that <e> <s> therefore the question of need was decided in february <e> <s> what we are now talking about is an increase above that decided if the figures prove to be so by the authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords if i add more i shall be repeating myself <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord does not wish me to do that <e> <s> the time for deciding on the needs on the one hand and the availability of resources to go towards those needs on the other is when the allocations are made <e> <s> that was done in february <e> <s> if there is now to be a very substantial overspend of that then that is something that breaches the figures and that we just cannot have for the simple reason that we cannot afford it <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that we are covering amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for covering the topic in general <e> <s> he is quite right when he says that we are talking about the principle <e> <s> there is only one amendment with which i shall deal in detail <e> <s> may say that there is absolutely no difference between us on this <e> <s> i take the point that the noble lord made about the importance of allotments what they have meant and what they might still mean and what they coud mean in the future <e> <s> with that i am in full agreement in every respect so far as that goes <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that the concern which the noble lord lord avebury expressed about what might be done in the situation he outlined really should not be a problem because as he knows the way that local authorities deal with their estimates and the committee procedures are a tremendous safeguard <e> <s> nothing of the kind that he mentions can be done without the approval of the elected members in committee and indeed of the council which has to verify and debate the matter in public <e> <s> in any case most committees now operate in public <e> <s> even where they do not everything is written and has to be approved by the council <e> <s> there should not be much if any danger of people not knowing what happens <e> <s> it is also the wish of government and we have tried to express this in the bill and we are very anxious about this issue of accountability that people should know exactly what is happening <e> <s> therefore we approve of anything that makes that more evident <e> <s> we know that discussions are going on about codes of practice regarding the provision of information and the way it should be presented to people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in a slight difficulty <e> <s> i will cover the point that the noble lord raises but i do so only by leave of the house in that i have spoken twice <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say dealing with amendments no <e> <s> and no <e> <s> together that we have here amendments at least so far as no <e> <s> is concerned that would prevent a local authority when presented by a landowner and i use the term loosely to describe the owner the occupier or the lessee of land with an application for the diversion of a footpath or bridleway that crosses his land from entering into an agreement requiring that person to defray some or all of the costs that might be incurred in the payment of compensation under the order and to bring the new path into eligible condition unless they were first satisfied that the landowner would secure significant economic benefits from the diversion <e> <s> in other words the authority would be called upon without any facts or information to make a commercial judgment on the economic benefits to another person of the diversion of a right of way <e> <s> i would suggest that this is not a function the local authorities should be expected to undertake when determining in particular circumstances whether or not the making of an order should be conditional upon the reimbursement of their costs <e> <s> it is surely for the landowner in the full knowledge that he may be required to reimburse the authority to take account of all the relevant factors including economic benefits before deciding to apply for an order <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholeheartedly acknowledge the lack of expertise on farming matters so far as this minister is concerned <e> <s> i hope that that statement will not be held against me when we come to the bill <e> <s> section of the highways act as amended by section of the countryside act permits a footpath or bridleway that crosses agricultural land to be ploughed up along with adjoining land if it is convenient to do so in the interests of good husbandry <e> <s> the surface of the path must be made good within three weeks or if prior notice of the intention to plough was served on the highway authority within six weeks <e> <s> in addition the occupier of land may apply to the highway authority for an order temporarily to divert a path for a period not exceeding three months thereby extending the period within which restoration must take place <e>", "<cs> my lords while the government were at one time inclined to support an amendment on the lines of amendment no <e> <s> further consideration has given rise to doubts as to whether the offence as amended would not cover too wide a range of circumstances <e> <s> it might for example catch relatively trivial actions such as a lorry driver or other long distance traveller stopping in a layby for a sleep <e> <s> again it could conceivably cover people who had stopped to picnic on a highway verge <e> <s> that is why i cannot recommend acceptance of the amendment <e> <s> however speaking as the noble lord lord avebury did to a very similar amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am very much aware of my right honourable friend mr fowlers enthusiasm for cycling and his desire to encourage it and as i have noted from what has been said today there is obviously much support for that and i would not differ at all <e> <s> but i am not in agreement with the noble lord lord avebury that the best way to encourage it is to place new liabilities and duties on local authorities by statute <e> <s> my right honourable friend is considering a consultation paper on cycling which will follow up a number of the issues that the noble lord raised and others have touched upon <e> <s> i would have thought that was a very good thing to do because it will bring the whole thing into the open and we shall get some constructive comments on it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to my noble friend that having discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord was a secretary of state for eight years and was dealing with matters like planning appeals i wonder how he <e>", "<cs> what did the noble lord do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment has no effect on subsection the need to prepare prior written statements of price <e> <s> the amendment restricts the conditions which may be imposed on an authoritys allocation of work to its dlo to the simple competitive conditions which are fully detailed in subsection the requirement that tender invitations be invited from three other contractors and that they publish the results of that competition <e> <s> that had always been our intention but we found on close examination that we had given ourselves power to impose other conditions of an unspecified sort on the allocation of work which did not fall into the categories for which tendering will be compulsory <e> <s> we do not want that power and in moving this amendment i am inviting the house to take it away from us <e> <s> the discretion that will remain to us will then be limited to the prescription of the categories of work for which competitive tendering will be required and to variation of the number of competing offers to be invited if experience shows that the present three is the wrong figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had touched on that point <e> <s> i said that the amendment had no effect on subsection which is the one that refers to the need to prepare prior written notice of statements of price <e> <s> the other point the noble lord raises i find puzzling <e> <s> we tried hard to follow down the points that were made when we discussed this matter <e> <s> i think the noble lord himself brought this forth <e> <s> we tried to come forward with amendments which would cover in the main the points he has made <e> <s> i think that they do so and he has no need to fear <e> <s> there are many areas where we disagree and i suppose that we shall have to go on doing so but i should not have thought that that was one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have gone through a lengthy process of consultation on a possible rgime for regulating dlo tendering <e> <s> we have listened to the arguments from various quarters for both relaxation and indeed tightening of the proposals before my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state announced our <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i ought to comment on what was said by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> he quoted the observations of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> if he had gone on to quote the rest of that particular debate he would have found that when i responded to it i indicated i think i indicated this even before i responded that from my own experience of dlos i was not so far-reaching in my observations about them and that there were circumstances when they were very necessary <e> <s> as i am speaking for the government i think i ought to say that if the noble lord is referring to a government attitude i shall have to stand by what i said then <e>", "<cs> my lords before i respond to the noble baroness commenting upon the observation made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington may i say that had i had any aspirations of the kind to which he has referred i fear that his observations well-intentioned though they might have been would have been the kiss of death coming from where they did <e> <s> however as i have no such aspirations i am afraid i cannot help him on that <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would give way <e> <s> i know <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission of the house i cannot accept <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house may i just quickly say although how could one quickly dispose of a problem of the enormity of that to which the noble lord referred that when i said mind boggling i meant precisely that <e> <s> i do not come along a week later and say eureka <e> <s> i have the solution <e> <s> i indicated when we discussed this subject in committee my personal recognisance of the situation and in no way was i willing simply to shrug it off and say well it is just another problem for local authorities <e> <s> i accept that it is arguably potentially the greatest single problem that could face not just local government but everyone because i have some idea of the enormity of the matter to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> yes indeed <e> <s> i do not have an answer but the noble lord might he interested to know that i have discussed the problem even in the time since we spoke and it is only a few days at the highest possible level in the country and you know where that might be because i consider it so important <e> <s> i really do not think that in the context of this bill we have a solution to it at all <e> <s> it goes way beyond anything that is in this bill and must be looked upon on its own <e> <s> i just assure the noble lord again as i thought i had done previously that this problem is something we cannot turn away from nor do we intend to <e> <s> i do not have ready solutions but i promise him that we are well aware of what he is talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say straight away that the government are happy to accept the spirit and intention of this amendment <e> <s> however again we have doubts about its drafting as i indicated on committee stage <e> <s> on the substance let me repeat that we agree entirely that no hindrance must be put in the way of local authorities choosing any means at their disposal to deal with <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand the point which the noble lord lord mishcon is making <e> <s> i do not know that i can say any more than i have done about our intentions <e> <s> i can only say to him and to the noble lord who would have moved amendment no <e> <s> a that for the moment i think we must leave it as it is <e> <s> we will take this point away and think about it to see if we could not cover it in some way perhaps within regulations <e> <s> i should have thought it was possible <e> <s> i understand why this was put in <e> <s> my dilemma is that the point is a fair point but in practice it would not be a problem <e> <s> it could happen but i cannot see that it would <e> <s> taking the example to which the noble lord referred if an emergency arose and if somebody immediately embarked upon doing something to put it right it is unlikely that later someone would turn round and say you might have foreseen that that was so therefore you should have gone out to tender <e> <s> i am sure it would not happen in practice <e> <s> i can see where it could happen in theory and i hope we can cover it entirely by the wording of regulations <e> <s> if there is any doubt about that i shall want to think about it again <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house my lords i rise again to say that i really do not want to get involved in this any further <e> <s> we are talking about situations which arise in an emergency <e> <s> i did not say in connection with amendment no <e> <s> a that i would introduce an amendment at third reading <e> <s> i could not undertake to do that <e> <s> i have gone as far as anyone could go in assuring the house as to what our intentions are about competing in emergencies and i have been absolutely clear in that respect <e> <s> i said this must be my final word on the subject that i would look at what the noble lord lord mishcon had said and that if i felt that what we were proposing would not cover all the possibilities we should then have to decide what to do about it but beyond that i cannot go at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord moved this amendment in committee i indicated that although we understand the motives behind it and <e>", "<cs> my lords when we had quite a lengthy discussion on this in committee i undertook to have another look at the drafting but i hope i was <e>", "<cs> my lords i will do my best to answer the points the noble baroness made when she referred to the different bodies <e> <s> so far as i am aware there is not in the bill a definition of dlos as such but i think that what a dlo is will be obvious to most people <e> <s> here i am taking a chance in giving my definition but it seems to me that it would be a unit of people employed directly by the local authority themselves to carry out certain works <e> <s> we know that in practice what that usually means is either works of maintenance or in some cases of new building or whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords i think what we have to do immediately is to get this whole thing into perspective <e> <s> what are we talking about <e> <s> so far as this amendment goes we are talking about calling for a special report <e> <s> we are talking about the secretary of state calling for a special report to consider the position in a direct labour organisation where for the reasons we have talked about before or indeed for any other reason he feels he ought to look at exactly what is going on in that organisation <e> <s> with that as the basic fundamental point everything else falls into place because not only can i see no harm in that but i think it is eminently desirable and indeed long overdue that there should be such an interest taken in the interests of those people who are not always able properly to see that their interests in this way are looked after <e>", "<cs> my lords we agree that dlo performance must be judged over a reasonable period and we think that three years is a fair minimum <e> <s> there is of course nothing to stop a local authority from preparing a report which covers a period longer than three years <e>", "<cs> my lords of course following the discussions in committee we have examined very closely the drafting of this clause to which my noble friend spoke in committee <e> <s> we agree with him that these two paragraphs look odd they certainly do to me as a layman <e> <s> nevertheless having looked at it carefully it seems that they do serve a useful purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said whenever my noble friend lord renton speaks on these matters one has to listen particularly carefully because of his obviously great expertise and indeed interest and background in all such matters <e> <s> because of that i say that not only have i listened carefully to what he has said now but i also listened carefully in committee the other week as indeed i did when my noble friend lord sandford was moving his amendments both on this and on past occasions <e> <s> in other words this was the amendment to impose the same restriction on the secretary of states power to call for a special report <e>", "<cs> my lords the ultimate sanction against an authority which fails to get its dlo operations under firm continuing control will be an intervention by the secretary of state to remove or restrict its powers to use direct labour <e> <s> such action can come only after the submission of a special report required under subsection and cannot therefore happen until the authority has had an opportunity to explain itself <e> <s> closure or restriction will not follow automatically <e> <s> there may be special circumstances which explain an unsatisfactory performance or there may be a need to retain a small direct labour force to deal with certain sorts of work for example winter highway maintenance in remote areas for which no contractors can be found and the decision of the secretary of state will be able to take account of those factors <e> <s> furthermore the close-down or restriction will not necessarily take even immediate effect <e> <s> the subsection allows the secretary of state to set the effective date so that authorities would have time to make the necessary alternative arrangements to enable them to fulfil their statutory duties by means other than through their own directly employed labour force <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have recognised that there is a point at which the full benefits to be gained from the bill will not be realised <e> <s> it is a matter of judgment to decide where that point comes <e> <s> we believe that point is reached when an authority employs or less in its direct labour organisation <e> <s> by building industry standards an organisation employing operatives and with an annual turnover of about a quarter of a million pounds is quite big <e> <s> the clause will permit those organisations which are genuinely minimum-level dlos to escape the rigours the bill imposes <e> <s> we should not wish to see a higher figure <e> <s> i recognise that what my noble friend suggests gives a certain discretion but we have been assailed on all sides for precisely the opposite reason <e> <s> i do not think that at this moment we should depart from the path on which we have embarked <e> <s> therefore perhaps he may not feel so deeply about it as to wish to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite true that i promised the committee that i would examine this provision and look into the procedures <e> <s> i assure your lordships that i have done exactly that and very carefully <e> <s> but i have to advise that i see no case for it <e> <s> before i say anything else i ought to say that i have been impressed by exactly what is involved in the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> i have heard it diminished in its importance so often in your lordships house that i assumed in my ignorance that only the affirmative resolution procedure could be the real safeguard <e> <s> but the more that one looks at exactly what is involved the more one realises that it is indeed very much a safeguard <e> <s> i think it was my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter who said something on those lines not long ago <e> <s> having had a look at it i endorse that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know where this figure of technical officers comes from and with great respect to my noble friend i just do not accept it at all <e> <s> i should want a lot more information <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house may i say not in the slightest <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord monson that indeed we do think very carefully about this particular aspect because it goes to the heart of the whole rates debate but as the noble lord said when we debated this at the committee stage i argued then that putting a freeze on all rates at the levels pertaining to would penalise those authorities that in had low rate poundages while favouring any that rated highly in that year <e> <s> as the noble lord has said this is an attempt in this new amendment to try to make some allowance for that it attempts to overcome it by allowing rating authorities to select at which of the three years they would wish to see the levels frozen <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i thought that in responding to the noble lord lord monson i had in fact expressed considerable sympathy with the motives behind the amendment and i do so again <e> <s> i entirely accept what my noble friend has just said that there will be even deeper resentment if despite the block grant we see rate increases of the kind that some threaten they will punish their ratepayers by imposing <e> <s> what they fail to appreciate is that industry and commerce pay per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> of all rates anyhow <e> <s> the people they are punishing most are those who are there to provide employment and that is why it is not uncommon now in fact it is beginning to be more and more common to see people moving away from areas precisely because rates are becomng so punitive that they simply cannot afford to carry on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that really impressive contribution from my noble friend lord colville <e> <s> as i explained to my noble friend lord mottistone at an earlier stage when he raised the subject sir derek rayner has been conducting a review of the procedures governing valuation lists and the statutory position of rating authorities is being covered in that review <e> <s> i also said that i did not wish to reach a premature conclusion about this matter <e> <s> i am afraid i can still go no further than that <e> <s> the government have yet to complete their wide consultations on this subject and their examination of the issues and therefore no conclusions have yet been reached <e> <s> i hope that as before your lordships will agree not to take this amendment further but to await the outcome of the review <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is identical to one that was put down in committee and was rejected <e> <s> it would impose on the secretary of state a duty to consult with every authority whose grant was to be reduced as a result of the provisions of the clause before making the reduction <e> <s> although the amendment stems i believe from a concern that the secretary of state might act arbitrarily under the powers of this clause this is precluded by the fact that under clauses and the secretary of state is required to specify in an order the principles upon which he proposes to reduce grant under the transitional arrangements <e> <s> this order is then subject to the affirmative resolution of the house of commons <e> <s> as i have made clear before this in no way precludes an individual local authority making representations to the secretary of state <e> <s> i went into this subject at considerable length in committee <e> <s> i have in front of me copious notes indicating how all the authorities had every indication of the situation <e> <s> i have no intention unless pressed to do the same thing all over again and therefore i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords again this amendment is identical to one that was put down at the report stage in another place and was rejected <e> <s> it is intended to prevent the transitional arrangements from being used this year <e> <s> as i tried to emphasise in committee this is the one year and after the introduction of the block grant the only year in which they will exist because they will then lapse <e> <s> the amendment will not be necessary and hence we cannot accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i would i suppose have to trot out a list of people who come in the category mentioned by the noble lord but who feel precisely opposite to the way he does <e> <s> i could produce such a list <e> <s> the fact is that i would commend the house to read very carefully exactly what i said on this subject in committee because to do justice to what has been said this evening i should have to go over that almost word for word <e> <s> but i will refrain from the temptation and perhaps comment upon one or two of the observations that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords first i <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not take the point at all <e> <s> the authorities concerned know quite clearly where they do or do not stand in relation to the calculations <e> <s> there is nothing secret about it <e> <s> they knew all along exactly where they stood <e> <s> they have had the chance and they have the chance to this day to come along there is still time and as i tried to say to the noble baroness some of them are indeed doing just that <e> <s> and when they do come along they know quite clearly where they have to get to and what they have to do <e> <s> the last thing we should want to do as the noble baroness lady david said would be to say you should spend more on education and less on housing or less on social services <e> <s> that is the very last thing that they would ever want central government to do <e> <s> it is not our job to do it nor would we try <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord lord underhill would mind very much if i spoke also to amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i will try not to make that particular point when replying <e> <s> at committee stage of the bill amendments were proposed which would have had the effect of preventing orders from being made abolishing tsg completely and would have ensured that the grant had to continue at least for a more limited range of expenditure or for fewer than the total number of counties <e> <s> on that occasion i gave a number of reassurances <e> <s> these amounted to the fact that any decision to abolish tsg would not be taken lightly and would be made only if the government were satisfied that whatever arrangements succeeded it met the objectives of tsg <e> <s> moreover i pointed out that under existing legislation it was already possible to pay tsg to fewer than the total number of counties <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose i had better deal first with the noble lord lord evans and the various points he made <e> <s> i would start by referring him to what i said before except that he has quoted so extensively that i have to assume that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know for how long the noble lord has been there but i assume that it is longer than i have and he must have been there for some time while the previous administration were there <e> <s> therefore i hope that for the whole of that time he was pressing them to explain exactly how rate support grant settlement was arrived at <e> <s> the fact simply is and it seems i am saying it again and again that the previous system based as it was in the main upon the multivariant regression analysis was so very involved and was so very much a secret within the black box as i referred to it that no one did understand it at all <e> <s> the levers that were pulled produced the answers that you wanted <e> <s> as i have said time and again the present system differs from that <e> <s> simple it is not because any system that sets out to distribute grant to equalise among some authorities cannot be a simple calculation <e> <s> but at least we are going much further than anyone has ever gone before in bringing into the open what it is all about and how it works <e> <s> indeed this will be debated in parliament in a way that has never taken place before it was not possible for it to take place because the information simply was not there <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the secretary of state already has to have regard to the current levels of pay and prices and likely future movements as they will affect local authorities in the grant year <e> <s> in so doing he has to consult the local authorities whose representatives are quick i assure your lordships to draw attention to all factors which they think will affect authorities <e> <s> subsection c largely recognises present practice in preparing rsg settlements and reports <e> <s> the level of relevant accepted expenditure and the price base are specified <e> <s> so is the general allowance to be made for pay and price movements in the grant year <e> <s> the present requirements of subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords when we discussed this amendment at committee stage the noble baroness argued that it would be quite wrong if authorities which have increasing populations were to experience a decline in grant <e> <s> i explained then that this would only be wrong if block grant were to be paid out on the basis of so much per head of population <e> <s> but this is not the case <e> <s> block grant is an equalising grant and authorities receive sufficient grant to enable them to levy the same rate poundage as authorities providing services at comparable levels <e> <s> this may mean more or less grant for expanding authorities depending upon how the increase in population affects the overall balance between their needs and resources <e> <s> i said then that this amendment by seeking to establish a direct relationship between population and grant would undermine the equalisation objective of block grant and was incompatible with the block grant system <e> <s> this remains the case <e>", "<cs> by leave of the house may i say to my noble friend lord renton that i cannot go any further than i have <e> <s> the fact is that population is a factor <e> <s> i indicated that it will be more of a factor than it has been in the past but it cannot be the only factor and in my view it would be wrong to write it into the bill because if you can think of a large population in an area of great need and a small population in an area of relative wealth and then transpose them you will quickly see why population can never be the only factor in this whole matter of assessing need for grant purposes <e> <s> that is why while i tried to explain and indeed to emphasise that we took very much to heart the importance of the point which was made by the noble baroness i do not think anyone would want to argue beyond that <e> <s> i have just given the assurance i have as to the weight the government propose to attach to this in the future which is a change from the past but it cannot be the sole the major element in the sum <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in absolute sympathy with the new clause but when one looks closely at this matter it can be seen that the case for a specific grant of this kind is at best a marginal one <e> <s> under the resources element of the present rate support grant almost all rating authorities receive compensation for the relief that they must give <e> <s> under our new block grant even more authorities will receive compensation <e> <s> there will only be a handful of authorities at most which do not receive grant because they have such large resources of their own <e> <s> that would appear to give adequate recognition to the authorities loss of income <e>", "<cs> my lords when expenditure on the reclamation of derelict <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is very closely related to amendment no <e> <s> c <e> <s> i do not think that your lordships would thank me for repeating at length my reasons for believing that it would not be right to exclude from control expenditure on derelict land clearance <e> <s> the fact that this expenditure is grant-aided in some cases up to per cent <e> <s> is strictly speaking irrelevant because the main objective of part viii of the bill is to introduce an effective fair means of keeping local authorities total capital spending within planned levels no matter whether the expenditure is financed out of government grant local rates borrowing leasing or whatever other source of money <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely take the point that my noble friend makes and gladly assure him that we are in full agreement with what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not possibly attempt to put any figure of that kind upon it <e> <s> everything will depend on the extent to which the private sector become involved come in and do what we hope they will do <e> <s> in quite what form they will do it in terms of manufacturing warehousing or whatever else it may be obviously i cannot say at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the concept is a very radical one in what it sets out to do something far more than giving help to assisted areas or whatever all of which is helpful but which does not in any way go as far as these proposals do <e> <s> as we have said all along they are an experiment <e> <s> they are a bold attempt to try to do something in some of the worst areas <e> <s> what they will achieve only time will tell but we have high hopes for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that we were excluding anything as such at all <e> <s> we hope that the authorities within whose areas the zones will be set up will do everything to encourage <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am sure that the noble lord would not expect me to respond in the affirmative to that <e>", "<cs> the fact is that we are dealing here with areas which have been in this state for many years now <e> <s> had the previous administration been willing to do something about them we might not have to deal with them in the way we are doing now <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had spelt out that these were printing errors and hence my having taken the first opportunity and indeed the appropriate opportunity to put them right <e> <s> i do not know that i can add more for my noble friends benefit on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said when we were discussing this in committee indeed i believe it was almost an identical amendment that we had then and that we decided the issue on a division i as well as anyone i think understand why it is important for local authorities to have some reassurance about the availability of expenditure <e> <s> and as i have said previously we will go on giving as the noble lords lord mishcon and lord evans have said as much information and practical assistance as possible in that direction <e> <s> but as i also said in committee we cannot tie the government to a statutorily fixed level of allocations <e> <s> any government must be in a position to decide each year what the country can afford to spend <e> <s> this would have to be reflected in allocations which is not to say that we are not cognisant of the problem <e> <s> i think both noble lords who have spoken would accept that <e> <s> we will do everything we can to be helpful in that direction because we recognise how important it is but that does not mean that i can accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not very far apart in this matter <e> <s> i have for long been one of the staunchest advocates of the very policy of an authority using its resources to best advantage if it had some lying idle and doing nothing for years then what better way to get funds than by accumulating capital receipts selling those resources off and re-applying those receipts in the way that the authority felt it wanted without the need to borrow or go to ratepayers for money <e> <s> clearly as a philosophy it is something of which we approve wholeheartedly <e> <s> that is why the bill allows the authority to do that <e> <s> if we are to talk about what is permitted in so far as presently accumulated receipts from the past are concerned we should get into deeper water but even there the government take a very flexible approach to the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as lotteries are concerned we have agreed with the local authority associations that such proceeds can be treated as capital receipts for the purpose of permitting increased capital expenditure <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon has been successful in that part as indeed he has in some other parts of the bill reluctant though lie may be to acknowledge it well perhaps not reluctant <e> <s> i should not say reluctant my lords <e> <s> beyond that i fear the amendment is unacceptable in that it does not seek to permit allocations to be supplemented <e> <s> it does refer correctly to section of the local government miscellaneous provisions act but basically the rest of it is still unacceptable simply because it would weaken substantially the effect of the proposed controls <e> <s> for that reason i fear we cannot accept it <e> <s> having made some progress i hope the noble lord will feel that he does not want to press the rest of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should first get clear the difference <e> <s> if we are talking about airports and indeed we are very much doing so in the sense that they touched off this debate i should make it clear that the government have said and i have tried to indicate this to the noble lord lord hill that we take a very positive view of the expansion of airports <e> <s> we consider that to be a matter of regional and to some extent national importance and any projects that are subjects of regional and national importance are eligible for specific grants on top of allocations <e> <s> therefore we have looked closely at luton airport and while i cannot give any undertakings here nor would noble lords expect me to do so i have indicated to the noble lord lord hill that hopefully there will be a very favourable look and very shortly too i hope at specific allocations for them on top of the other allocations <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i was making was not that the allocation that comes from the department of <e>", "<cs> whatever is allocated to luton by the department of trade as a specific allocation on top will be used for the purposes that the department specify <e> <s> but additionally luton will have the other allocation for which they can decide the priority <e> <s> that can be used for some of the other purposes that are not specifically set out in the allocation from the department of trade <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house for the sake of procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is similar to one moved in committee by the noble lord lord davies of leek <e> <s> i was not able to accept that amendment but i was aware of the valuable work that many local authorities did and do in assisting local industry <e> <s> i therefore offered without any commitment to have a look at the matter again <e> <s> i have looked further into it but i am still not able to accept the proposal either in the previous form moved by the noble lord lord davies of leek or in the form of the present amendment <e> <s> the immediate reason is quite simple <e> <s> in either case it could involve the acquisition of assets by an authority in one year being recorded as having been acquired in the next <e> <s> that sort of manipulation of accounts would be unacceptable in any sphere of activity <e> <s> it is certainly unacceptable where public bodies such as local authorities are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords at first i had some difficulty in recognising the amendment at all but i understand that the noble baroness i think very fairly took the opportunity to raise this particular point <e> <s> i have no complaint as to that except that in return i am sure she will not have any complaint if i make a few observations on her remarks <e> <s> the noble baroness referred to the housing investment programme being slashed <e> <s> i would simply tell her that we still have a long way to go before if ever we reach the point of slashing it if that is the right word as much as the labour government slashed it during their term of office but perhaps the less said about that the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard of a step-by-step rearguard action but this is ridiculous <e>", "<cs> before i indicate our view of this amendment may i clarify the existing arrangements for notifying the secretary of state and also what we are proposing to do under the arrangements to be introduced by clause <e> <s> under the existing definition of county matters counties deal with all applications which would conflict with or prejudice the implementation of fundamental provisions of the structure plan <e> <s> in other words counties deal with cases which are major departures from the plan leaving districts to deal with minor ones <e> <s> the town and <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will make a few more comments not least in view of what my noble friend said about going into the lobby against us and a few additional observations may influence the noble baroness lady stedman even at this last gasp stage <e> <s> i should point out that the inescapable consequence of the amendment all else apart would be a greater flow of paper applications that would not <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to enter into an argument as to whether a brickworks is more like a cement <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that it is for the convenience of the house that i should speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> a to g and <e> <s> in committee we debated at considerable length the general principle of charging for planning applications <e> <s> i set out extensively the governments reasoning on it <e> <s> i do not think that your lordships will expect me to repeat at length all that i said then <e> <s> i have gone into the matter very closely since that time in correspondence with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and in discussions with my noble friend lord caithness and others and have thought and discussed this matter extensively <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i should like to say that i did not particularly pick up this point <e> <s> i will do so at my noble friends special request <e> <s> his point concerned lord belsteads statement about responsibility for magistrates courts <e> <s> my noble friend lord belstead in responding to the arguments in favour of restoring responsibility for magistrates courts to large non-metropolitan districts was not enunciating a general principle <e> <s> he was surmising what might happen if discussions between the local authority associations broke down <e> <s> of course we should consider what to do if that were to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should want some notice of the second of the points made <e> <s> i should think it may very well not apply but i should not want to say that categorically without having it confirmed that is my feeling about the point <e> <s> i think the other point is not valid <e> <s> one can take every service and it has always been open to debate when does one charge specifically and when does one not charge specifically <e> <s> in that case i think i should have to say one should never charge for boating on lakes one should never charge for the many things for which local authorities charge if one is against the principle of charging as such <e> <s> the point i am trying to make here is that here is a service which costs some million a year to run <e> <s> it is for the benefit not of all the people surely this is the asnwer <e> <s> the services to which my noble friend refers are available to everyone at any time whether or not they wish to use them <e> <s> one decides on ones own whether or not to make an application for planning permission <e> <s> i think there is a considerable difference <e> <s> just before i sit down may i say that i have been handed a note which says that the point about the playing field is a fair one and there may well have to be concessions on that so my first instincts on it were not too far away from fact <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house this is report stage and i have stood up four or five times now so i am very much out of order but i will try to cover the point the noble lord makes <e> <s> to the best of my knowledge the position in the enterprise zones is that the whole of the planning regimes the planning structures subject to health and safety factors do not apply <e> <s> therefore i assume that the same goes for planning applications <e> <s> but i had better state straight away because i am well aware of the fact that i speak for government on this that i will have to confirm it <e> <s> i am virtually certain that is so and i will confirm it both for the noble lord and any other of your lordships who wish me so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords yet again by leave of the house yes i am happy to confirm that the government have conceded all those cases <e> <s> i was very careful to read them out slowly to make sure that they were on the record <e> <s> we do accept that is so and that they will not be subject to the charges <e>", "<cs> my lords again by leave of the house and i hope for the last time with regard to the point made by the noble baroness i would say that there is still an option <e> <s> first please do not let us talk about the garage because if the garage does not come within the per cent <e> <s> i for one would be very surprised indeed so no application will be required <e> <s> but you will still have the option of considering what the total cost is likely to be and if it is thousands of pounds and we are talking about you would have to decide whether or not it was worth it <e> <s> that would be your decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the undertaking that the noble lord asks for <e> <s> i can only tell him that i will talk to colleagues about this <e> <s> i am not sure myself quite what the implications are <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord has much greater knowledge than i of that but i have heard what he says and i assure him that we will think about it <e> <s> of course he knows i can give no commitment but i will talk to colleagues about it <e> <s> i can go no further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt very much whether it will be possible to see the regulation beforehand <e> <s> but i certainly undertake to tell both the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble baroness lady david what we may or may not be able to do <e> <s> i doubt very much whether the regulation if that is what it proves to be would be available in time <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say at once that i am also speaking here to amendment no <e> <s> za <e> <s> i am sympathetic to the argument that says that the scale of charges may throw up hardships or anomalies which would justify a refund <e> <s> that is precisely why we have resisted amendments which would have removed <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house on this point of renumbering is it not a fact that the point is met by government amendments nos <e> <s> a and <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i admire the way in which the noble lord lord mishcon sets up his own point and then so very well knocks it down again <e> <s> i fear that i cannot help him as i think he suspected <e> <s> therefore the decision must be his as to pressing the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should think the answer must be no and no <e> <s> i cannot think of any circumstances in which it might be any permutation of yes and no or no and yes <e> <s> i am sorry not to be more helpful to my noble friend but i feel that would be the answer my lords you might not believe it but i have had a note handed to me which says yes and no <e> <s> therefore the permutation in fact was one that could have come about <e> <s> so i say formally now to set the record straight that the answer is yes and no <e>", "<cs> my lords i did undertake on committee to take this point away and think seriously about it <e> <s> i am rather surprised to learn from the noble lord lord evans that this is a subject on which i did not write to him or give him words of solace in one way or another <e> <s> i can see very clearly the force of the argument that when it comes to meeting charges the owner-occupier is in a different position from the big organisation or company <e> <s> nevertheless i finally cannot accept the argument that the owner-occupier whatever his circumstances should meet none of the cost of the development control system <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that i can add anything to what i said when i spoke previously to this particular amendment <e> <s> i fear that anything i say will be repetition <e> <s> in the circumstances i hope that the noble lord lord monson will excuse me from dilating further <e> <s> he knows the reasons why i said we could not accept the amendment while i personally expressed some sympathy for what it tries to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords with this amendment may i also speak to amendment no <e> <s> xa <e> <s> the government appreciate the desirability of clarifying exactly what constitutes a decision on a planning application <e> <s> the existing legislation and decisions of the courts leave the position unclear <e> <s> our own proposals for clarifying the position had to be excluded from the local government planning and land no <e> <s> bill for lack of space <e> <s> the noble lord has put forward his own proposals on lines different from the governments and i am grateful to him for his efforts in tackling this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment would be to make the county planning authority instead of the designated planning authority which may be the district responsible for deciding what modifications are necessary to keep an expedited local plan in general conformity with a county structure plan as it stands for the time being <e> <s> clearly therefore the noble lords amendment is in conflict with the existing provisions of the act and in particular with section c <e> <s> i respectfully suggest that the proposal advanced by the noble lord is unnecessary because regulation of the town and country planning structure and local plans regulations requires that when the authority which prepared a local plan proposes to modify it before adoption it shall prepare a list of the proposed modifications with reasons for proposing them give notice by advertisement of the proposed modifications and give an opportunity for objections to be made to them <e> <s> the authority has a duty to consider those objections and also a duty to ensure that on adoption the local plan is in general conformity with the structure plan <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a very fair comment <e> <s> the local planning authority is always the district planning authority <e> <s> the county planning authority deals with the structure plans and matters pertaining to them <e> <s> local plans are dealt with by the local authority <e> <s> unless someone tells me otherwise i have never known it to mean anything other than the district planning authority <e>", "<cs> of course my lords with many apologies <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble lord lord ponsonby will be glad to know that we accept these two amendments <e> <s> just before i sit down although i realise that my noble friend could not move his amendment i hope it will not be out of order for me to say that we have some sympathy with all these purposes as we have shown by what has been said to the noble lord lord ponsonby <e> <s> if we can look at third reading at the particular point that concerned my noble friend about this whole area we shall endeavour to do so if not it could be done at some date in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept entirely the purpose that my noble friend lord sandford is seeking to achieve by his group of amendments nos <e> <s> a b a and but i regret to have to confirm that the drafting of no <e> <s> a which is the main amendment of the group is defective in that the wording of the new subsection which he seeks to insert into section of the act does not at one point make sense i mean that with no disrespect <e> <s> in view of all the complexities i certainly should not attempt to criticise anyone but it would appear that a rather more elaborate provision than that contained in the amendment is necessary for the proper achievement of my noble friends purpose <e> <s> but we will see whether anything can be done at third reading <e> <s> my noble friend knows that we will try very hard to do that although there is not much time <e> <s> if not he can rest assured that the point will be noted for legislation on the first suitable opportunity that may present itself <e> <s> but let us not be pessimistic <e> <s> we really will be trying to have this ready for third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave or the house if my noble friend feels able to withdraw the amendment we will try to work together to achieve something <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier i confirm that this is acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to accept the amendment as amended <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say at once that we do take the amendments very seriously indeed <e> <s> when we discussed the noble lords amendments in committee i emphasised that the government recognised the value of high quality agricultural land and i readily do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must smile <e> <s> if i state based upon considerable discussions and advice from officials what the intentions are i really am not going to say that unless i am satisfied that this is exactly what is proposed <e> <s> it is not always possible for me at a moments notice to trot out regulations some of which are in any case not even completed in some cases because it is quite normal for that to be so before a bill is finalised <e> <s> when i said what i did say about intentions and the position based on advice given to me in some cases and upon my own experience in others <e> <s> i would hope the noble earl might be willing to accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful particularly to my noble friend lord caithness for his last remarks <e> <s> yes i suspect that he is quite right about that <e> <s> however the drafting of the amendment is somewhat ambiguous as it is not clear whether the objection needs to be withdrawn before the days or the secretary of state shall direct before the days <e> <s> it seems likely that the former was intended <e> <s> it seems also that if the former were the right interpretation and the minister of agriculture took longer than days to decide to withdraw the objection the plan must be called in even if the minister of agriculture did not wish to maintain his objection <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friends understand that <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house and with great respect thought that i went to considerable lengths when speaking earlier to the previous amendment to spell out slowly and in detail precisely why i believed that my noble friends fears were in fact unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend brought forward a similar amendment in committee when i explained that while we supported it in principle we could not accept it because of its then minor technical defects <e> <s> he obligingly withdrew that amendment for further consideration and will be glad to learn that the government are happy to accept the present amendments all four of them <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the government i am glad to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i said at the time that we would accept this amendment too <e>", "<cs> my lords this altered form of the amendment originally proposed by my noble friend lord mottistone in committee goes beyond the recommendation of the franks committee which was that the principal parties should if they wished have an opportunity of proposing corrections to the factual part of the inspectors report <e> <s> it tends to bear out what my noble friend lord colville of culross said in committee by extending that opportunity to all the parties appearing at the inquiry which of course is the scottish practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope my noble friend lord mottistone will not feel that there is any particular significance in it but yes i do accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will recall that we discussed this at some length in the context of clause and its dependent schedules and i do not want now to repeat the excellent arguments made then by my noble friend lord ferrers <e> <s> schedule to the bill however with its provisions relaxing the secretary of states involvement in smoke control orders and noise abatement orders was then approved and i believe that it would be inconsistent to abandon this principle by the deletion of paragraph of schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have emphasised all along my noble friend and i fully appreciate and understand the importance of respecting and preserving the character of areas of architectural and historic interest particularly conservation areas <e> <s> in order to meet the-concern expressed today and during the committee stage we propose to send a letter to local authorities urging them to make fuller use of the powers already available to them for controlling advertising <e> <s> this is something that we shall certainly be watching <e> <s> in regulation of the control of advertisement regulations there is a power to issue a discontinuance notice in any circumstances where the local <e>", "<cs> my lords i did say that we would send out a letter <e> <s> i chose my words very carefully to indicate the line that that letter would take <e> <s> i was also careful to say <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed different from a circular <e> <s> we set about reducing the number of circulars that we would send out <e> <s> subject to confirmation currently per cent <e> <s> fewer have been sent out than were sent out by the previous administration <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to say had i been allowed to finish that it does not mean that at all <e> <s> it is all really part of this whole question about how far one wants to govern by circular as was done so often in the past <e> <s> sometimes the local authority associations themselves like to send their own communications to their members but in this matter we are not seeking in any way to get away from the point we have promised namely that each authority will individually receive a letter from us <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not the slightest intention at pm and after several successive hours of consideration of this bill of debating semantics or definitions least of all with the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may try to pick up some of the points which have been made <e> <s> first i should like to say a sincere thank you to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for his support in this matter <e> <s> he is always highly respected in your lordships house and even more highly appreciated i may say by this not minister of state regrettably but parliamentary under-secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i make no comment on that <e> <s> i shall begin the wrong way round perhaps but i know <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that that was the last point that i touched upon <e> <s> in practice there is always talk that is ongoing <e> <s> anyone who has been involved in government knows that there are always discussions and commissions <e> <s> there are the new town corporations and it is an ongoing process <e> <s> one does not suddenly say stop <e> <s> shall we now go and see this new town <e> <s> there is consultation all the time with the regional officers and so on <e> <s> but if we write on the face of the bill a requirement like this it opens up a whole series of opportunities for those who may not be as anxious as is the noble lord or even in agreement with the philosophy expressed <e> <s> it gives many opportunities for delays and frustrations for going to the courts and so on and that we cannot have <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had covered the point of precedent <e> <s> when we look at the enormity <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an answer which i think is a fair one <e> <s> i am sorry if i did not sound fair to the noble lord i think i often do but perhaps on this occasion i did not <e> <s> will the noble lord perhaps repeat his other point <e>", "<cs> my lords that indeed was also the point touched on by the noble baroness when she said what guarantee do we have <e> <s> of course the noble lord is right on the face of the bill there is nothing but the guarantee is the commitment of the government to the future of new towns <e> <s> on the face of the bill no but i believe the government must have the opportunity and must be able to function in this way which even the labour government were seeking to do originally in their roll-over proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of correction may i simply say this <e> <s> in the first place i did not seek to stand up in the middle of the debate and end it i waited for over an hour listening to many people speak <e> <s> secondly it is not my way to seek to take advantage procedurally in any way <e> <s> i do not think anyone in your lordships house would say that of me i do not think the noble lord lord foot would say that <e> <s> thirdly as to his point of whether it is right for the government to bring something back we have had in this report stage i do not know how many certainly it is in double figures occasions on which issues which were defeated by the government at committee stage have been brought back in the identical form and discussed again without the right of people here now to know what went on at that time <e> <s> the government have made no comment as to that <e> <s> my noble friend made an observation but the government made no comment and no objection at all <e> <s> nor do i i see nothing wrong there <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak by leave of the house yet again i think that i have covered this point very carefully <e> <s> i tried to do so when i responded before by saying that the objections are that they throw up so many possibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords may i reply on this to say that if we are talking about leaseholds and freeholds as the noble baroness knows when leaseholds are sold in these circumstances usually one is talking about long leases of years or years or whatever <e> <s> the long-term intention of the new towns was always that at the end of the day they would go back to the local authorities where they were situated <e> <s> it is now years on that we see the first ones are going back <e> <s> i should have thought that as far as new towns development corporations themselves are concerned the issue of leasehold or freehold in terms of long leases would not be an issue to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment raises two important and quite distinct issues and i wonder whether i may begin by referring to the general policy question <e> <s> i must reiterate the fact that we moved an amendment at committee stage to restrict the type of area in which x udcs could be set up as a positive response to suggestions made by many people both at second reading in this house and elsewhere <e> <s> given that the legislation affords the secretary of state general and wide powers as to the areas that he can designate the argument was forcefully put to us that the powers of designation should be restricted <e> <s> we accepted that <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand why the noble lord lord bruce brings this amendment forward but i would suggest to him that to have a statutory requirement for a registered office is not appropriate to a body like a udc which will be appointed by the secretary of state and will be answerable to him <e> <s> as the noble lord so rightly said companies are required to have registered offices by the companies acts so that documents can be served on them particularly in legal proceedings and evasion of service is rendered impossible <e> <s> this is not appropriate for udcs whose whereabouts of course will be public knowledge and whose status will be guaranteed by the supervision of the secretary of state <e> <s> for this reason i am confident that the noble lord will feel able not to press this particular amendment <e> <s> in practical terms i think he will find that it will not be necessary because it does not have the problems that face the procedures required by private companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i should think that is right <e> <s> may i thank the noble viscount for that <e> <s> if that should not be so of course i will come back but it sounds absolutely right and i am grateful to the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble viscount lord simon particularly in view of what was said earlier when we were discussing this whole area of udcs will accept that the government attach considerable importance to consultation with local authorities which would be concerned with udcs <e> <s> that is why we tabled amendment no <e> <s> and why we shall now have a requirement for a udc to prepare a code of practice as to consultation with the relevant local authorities about the exercise of its power <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to answer the noble viscount by saying that it can but it may not necessarily be the same it will depend on the kind of area it is <e> <s> we debated this point at length previously <e> <s> if udcs should ever go beyond the two into urban and metropolitan areas then it will depend on the circumstances <e> <s> the county authorities and metropolitan areas have certain functions as regards highways and streets whereas the district authorities do not have that function <e> <s> that makes it difficult for me to give a simple answer to the noble viscount much as i should like to do so but i think he follows the gist of what i have said <e>", "<cs> my lords as clause provides for local authorites to supply goods and services to a udc we have enabled local authorities to be paid for a wider range of goods and services that a udc might require <e> <s> what however we do not wish to do is to provide for local authorities to become agents of a udc for the central purpose of achieving the object of the udc under clause <e> <s> we should not have taken steps to set up udcs in the first place if we thought there was a likelihood that the main function would be contacted out in the manner suggested in the amendment <e> <s> that is the problem and i recall that when we discussed this in committee there was not a great deal between the noble lord lord evans of claughton and myself over this <e> <s> he just wanted to see whether he should take it further which obviously he has done but my answer is the one i have given namely that the amendment would go further than we believe is necessary in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that at the end of the day it will very much be a matter of what makes good sense <e> <s> as the noble viscount rightly said if the situation is obvious and logical it would be silly of those who are running udcs not to take advantage of what is available i should certainly hope that they would <e> <s> but there is a great difference between that and spelling out obligations and it is probably there that we would slightly part company <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say at once that i by no means share the pessimism of the noble lord lord bruce on the likely outcome of the requirements called for under these parts of the bill and i wonder whether i need remind him i am sure i do not that we are here dealing with areas which are arguably among the most derelict and needy in the whole of the country <e> <s> they require drastic action and that is what these udcs are all about <e> <s> therefore when we talk of comparisons with other areas in other ways i would respectfully submit that they really are very special and that is why they are entitled as we propose to have his special treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish the noble lord would not keep referring to quangos with such i was about to say opprobrium but perhaps if i were to put it in the way i should prefer it might not hit just the right note at this time of night <e> <s> the fact is that this government have if you like set up quangos but they would have to run into hundreds to equal the number set up by the previous adminstration <e> <s> if you offset the hundreds that we are disbanding and have disbanded i think that sets the record straight <e> <s> but we have never said that there is no room for special bodies to do special work we have said that there were so many of them that they proliferate and grow like topsy and that one must be careful about them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is much that i can add to what i have said <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> the point he made is valid <e> <s> there is a great difference between accounts audited in the say we intend and in the way one would need them for laying before parliament <e> <s> i see no way in which we could agree that we could put a statutory requirement like this in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that the noble lord is tonight at his most persuasive <e> <s> we do not object in principle to this amendment but it seems to us that this is the sort of matter which would be far better left to directions given to the secretary of state under clause of this bill <e> <s> the power to require udcs to publish information is contained in clause alongside that for other public bodies such as the new town development corporations water authorities and so on <e> <s> the powers are exercisable by directions which may specify the manner form and occasions on which such publication is made <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the noble lord is correct but i wonder whether i may be allowed to say just a few words to the whole range of the amendments a to h <e> <s> i am pleased to accept amendments nos <e> <s> a to h on the understanding that the noble lord has changed the word the at the end of the first line of c to their and that the words or used in the second line of h are omitted <e> <s> in accepting these amendments the government recognise the constructive approach exemplified by the amendments in extending to local authorities a similar kind of protection to that afforded under the clause to statutory undertakers <e> <s> as i shall indicate in relation to amendments nos <e> <s> a and b the government propose to table at third reading an amendment to incorporate the amendment consequential to a to h and which a and b seek to achieve but in their present form they are defective <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the intention to move just this amendment but if i may i too will speak to no <e> <s> ya as well <e> <s> this amendment seeks to prevent a new town development corporation from drawing up a scheme for an enterprise zone and subsequently being designated as the body responsible for the zone <e> <s> promoting development and creating the right conditions for industry and commerce to flourish are particular strengths of the development corporations <e> <s> we felt that in some cases it might be desirable in order to ensure rapid development of difficult run-down areas to combine the expertise and single-mindedness of the development corporation with the incentive of enterprise zone status <e>", "<cs> my lords i am entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords the first statutory step in setting up an enterprise zone is for the secretary of state to send an invitation to the authority concerned asking them to prepare a scheme <e> <s> the invitation will specify the boundary of the zone and certain other matters for instance the bodies which must be consulted about the scheme <e> <s> as i understand it this amendment would repuire the secretary of state to include in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i gave the wrong impression <e> <s> we are cognisant of their problems as well <e> <s> but if we are talking of a hypermarket or even a very large retailing unit we would have to look at each separate area <e> <s> i do not know each of the areas where it has already been designated subject to agreement and i do not know each individual situation but it would probably be right to say that there must be some areas where they would very much welcome the kind of retailing units about which we are talking <e> <s> so we must do it in a very flexible way and be aware of the kind of problems that have been mentioned and we are aware of them <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make one brief observation which may be helpful <e> <s> noble lords might like to know that the possible solutions under discussion at present are about planning restrictions and not so much about changes to rating exemption because our conclusion is that the rating exemption itself should stand <e> <s> therefore i want to stress that we believe that there is much scope for protecting other traders through the planning regime <e> <s> as regards corner shops the chances are that they have a very local market and would be less likely to be affected but that again will depend on the area and the individual situation <e> <s> i think that we would have to wait and see the outcome of what we set up in each case <e>", "<cs> my lords as i made plain in committee it is the belief of the government that there is adequate provision for any staff who may be affected by the bill in the compensation terms already available for local government staff who are made redundant or lose their jobs in the interests of greater efficiency <e> <s> these terms were agreed between both sides of local government and are available for the staff of new towns as well as those employed by local authorities <e> <s> the scheme is in process of being converted into regulations which it is hoped can be made later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is part of a series with all the us and vs and ws <e> <s> this is acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how nice of the noble baroness to make her last point in the way she did <e> <s> i think we need not weigh too much on this point of definition <e> <s> the phrase direct labour organisation is not used in the text of the bill <e> <s> it is used in the title but it is not used in the text of the bill except in the phrase dlo revenue account which is defined <e> <s> therefore strictly speaking there is no need for a definition as such <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord henley <e> <s> my noble friend lord morris in moving his amendment to this subsection in committee gave notice that he would be considering the matter further and i agreed that the drafting would repay closer examination <e> <s> it is as my noble friend lord henley says a matter of drafting and no one in this house or in another place has ever challenged the substance of this provision <e> <s> there is happy unanimity on what is required the publication of tender competition results without the breach of any commercial confidentiality between authority and contractor <e> <s> the present amendment appears to have the merit of simplicity and certainly shortens the clause and i accept it willingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i say at once that i entirely and unreservedly accept the intentions of the noble lord lord bruce of donington in moving the amendment and i am not unaware of the concern to which he referred <e> <s> i know that many local authorities are anxious about their ability to get to where the bill calls on them to be within the time stipulated <e> <s> however the amendment presents problems because as noble lords will know we are anxious that the earliest possible start should be made and therefore this is a problem of striking a balance <e>", "<cs> my lords as i hope everyone in your lordships house will know by now quite clearly i am sure they do the purpose of the rate support grant system is to enable authorities to provide a comparable standard of service for a similar rate in the in other words it is an equalising grant <e> <s> this amendment is about whether the poundage cost to authorities of equal increments in expenditure should be equalised as the noble baroness suggested on a <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate the point the noble baroness is making i do not accept that there is cause to be alarmed about the clause in its <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord hill for what he has just said <e> <s> in fact i think it is the next amendment which covers the point <e> <s> nevertheless the sentiments are most appreciated and i am very grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that i was being unusually genial if genial is the right word <e> <s> if that is so it can only be because of the approaching end of some of our labours <e> <s> but i think we had better just hang on a little because there are still some amendments to come yet and who knows <e> <s> nevertheless i appreciate the spirit of what the noble lord said <e> <s> would that i was able to be so helpful <e> <s> i hope noble lords will have noticed the fact that it was my noble friend lord avon who accepted the noble baronesss amendment so perhaps it is to him that the words should be directed on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see why one should assume in the first instance that briefs are necessarily not common sense <e> <s> i could be accused perhaps more than most of not sticking closely to mine <e> <s> indeed i assure the noble lord that the complaint i get is that i depart too often from the briefs and do not stick to them <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mishcon has said the amendment is in two parts and i must say at once that the intention behind the first part is not at all clear to me <e> <s> it could mean either that where the minister withdraws an expenditure allocation he must follow the principles set out in subsections and of clause or it could mean that the minister must not apply different principles to the withdrawal of different expenditure allocations made for the same year but in either case the first part of the amendment seems to be confusing <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no need because we have made it clear that where a contractual obligation is undertaken that simply stands <e> <s> there is no question that it can be interfered with in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting point and offhand i would say that it would not be covered <e> <s> in other words in such an event the authority would not be able to enter into the further commitment to finish off <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that i can add much to what i said before <e> <s> i think we may be on slightly different ground here i suspect we probably are <e> <s> to me the great strength of the argument that i was putting was the one where the noble lord asked would authorities behave like naughty children <e> <s> that is not the term i would use but i would have to say that in my experience it is not unknown for authorities either anticipating or knowing that certain directions will take place to take steps to if you like nip in beforehand <e> <s> i think in some instances this is not an unreasonable thing to do <e>", "<cs> well my lords i am not going to say <e> <s> certainly it is the kind of matter that one has thought about <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems as if i really need to emulate houdini but i think that i can do just that <e> <s> let me say at once that i really do not know what this is all about <e> <s> i do not know why there is all this major concern <e> <s> let me make it absolutely clear and i sincerely hope that this will assuage the major concern of my noble friends and indeed of noble lords opposite that in fact with three exceptions to which i shall refer in a moment all nationalised industries make planning applications and will pay charges for so doing <e> <s> that surely is the matter which is causing most concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i would refer to section at page of the town and country planning act <e> <s> that applies to transmission lines and power stations <e> <s> the opencast coal mines have special legislation and i shall get that information in a few moments <e> <s> if i could read the writing before me i would give it to noble lords now <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend lord mackay who so often comes to my help assures me that you do not have to apply for planning consent <e> <s> i have before me a piece of paper which says that in fact section of the opencast coal act covers the point about opencast coal mining <e> <s> the point i make is that with the three exceptions that i have mentioned for the specific reason i have given nothing in what we propose in the bill sets out to exclude any nationalised bodies <e> <s> they all fall within this bill they will all have to make applications and pay charges <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mishcon made clear the amendment returns to ground which we debated exhaustively both in committee and on report and on which we divided <e> <s> throughout the debates the noble lord has expressed fears about the lack of a direct precedent for the wording of this clause <e> <s> he has wanted to see the powers of the secretary of state limited in some way by the wording of the clause <e> <s> i think his latest attempt is an improvement on the previous one since it would make the decisions of the secretary of state less susceptible to delay through challenge in the courts <e> <s> however i still cannot advise the house to accept the amendment and i will explain why <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to have a very quick word since i recall that the noble baroness <e> <s> lady denington was not present when we discussed this matter at report stage <e> <s> i know the noble baronesss interest in this matter and so i should like very briefly to say again something that i said at that time and which i strongly believe <e> <s> i said that i felt that this particular case was as strong as most if not all cases about which i had spoken in your lordships house <e> <s> it is about how we deal with national resources <e> <s> there must be a point in time when a government putting hundreds of millions of pounds a year into any sector and here we are talking about new towns which we support must ask can we afford to do this and if we must do it where do we get the money from <e> <s> if there is a possibility of taking assets from those new towns that have been there for some time putting the assets into liquid form and then redeploying them to the benefit of new towns as has been the case in the last two years i see nothing wrong in doing that <e> <s> furthermore i think it absolutely vital that sooner or later we accept the reality that there is only so much money available <e> <s> redeploying money in this way puts it to the best use without forever printing new money <e> <s> i believe passionately in the case for what we are doing and i am sure that if we divide on this issue my noble friends will fully support me <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say very quickly that this question still comes back to the basic principle <e> <s> the government have shown their intentions in that in the last two years they have ploughed million into the new towns <e> <s> i think that that is great evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords as on one or two other occasions today i have been close to the noble lord but just have not managed to get all the way with him <e> <s> i understand the purpose behind this amendment <e> <s> direct labour organisations do work mainly for their own authorities and part iii of the bill is concerned that the true cost of having work done by a direct labour organisation including depreciation and replacement cost of equipment used should always be shown <e> <s> it is not unreasonable therefore to argue that the cost of providing that equipment for the organisation should not be controlled separately since to do so could result in double counting once when the asset is acquired by the authority for the organisation and once when the use of the asset is included in the cost of using it for example for building a school <e>", "<cs> my lords there is very little i need to add to what my noble friend lord sandford has said <e> <s> he has explained fully the reason for this group of amendments <e> <s> i am very grateful indeed for all the trouble that he has taken <e> <s> i am happy to advise your lordships that these amendments should be agreed <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and are consequential on the previous amendments which i have now accepted <e> <s> i am very happy to accept these too <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not noticed the acc had done too badly out of the discussions that took place as we went along <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment makes a useful alteration to the provisions of section c giving the secretary of state direct powers to amend a development plan scheme in response <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the principle behind this amendment <e> <s> it is indeed the governments intention that udcs should operate in as open a way as possible and i am sure it is right that their reports should be made widely available at a reasonable charge that they should be capable of inspection and that these facts should be advertised <e> <s> i am very happy to give the noble lord an undertaking that we shall ensure that this gets done under the powers we have to give directions to udcs <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say immediately that i cannot give the kind of undertakings the noble lord asks me to do specifically <e> <s> the fact is that there are still questions to be answered in this area and the whole thing turns on discussions with individual authorities <e> <s> clearly i am not going to comment upon what any particular authority is saying because i shall need to be discussing it with them myself before i could do so <e> <s> but the fact is that it is the authorities themselves who have applied to us to be included in this <e> <s> when i said earlier that we were concerned about hypermarkets i meant exactly what i said <e> <s> but i cannot give an undertaking to accept an amendment which places a restriction in this way when i know how different the circumstances are in different areas and that what applies and is right and proper for one may be quite wrong for another <e> <s> nor would i want to mislead the noble lord lord ponsonby or this house that i would do so <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a long-awaited moment i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> it is virtually three months since we approved the second reading of this bill and although it is a long bill and in some parts a somewhat complicated one we have had a <e>", "<cs> my lords at this time i too have no intention of making another second reading speech but i ought to respond as briefly as i can i shall try to do so very briefly to some of the points that have been made <e> <s> may i begin by thanking everybody who has spoken for being so kind to me personally <e> <s> i appreciate that very much indeed <e> <s> it is quite a traumatic thing to go through and even more to hear nice things said in this way <e> <s> it makes one feel very humble <e> <s> that is certainly how i feel at the moment <e> <s> however i must pick up some of the points which have been made <e> <s> i am only sorry it seems that in debates which take place on that the bill do now pass <e> <s> that in addition to the courtesies and the expressions of mutual respect there has to be a reference to what the legislation is about <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point yes it is interesting that so many people asked and we shall have to see how many of those requests are translated into actual sales <e> <s> on the second point we know of what we read and what we hear and we shall watch the situation very carefully <e> <s> of course one would deplore a situation such as that which my noble friend described <e> <s> i would only repeat what my right honourable friend has said that we shall take all steps necessary to ensure that the statutory rights of individual tenants will not be frustrated <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not agree <e> <s> i should only like to reiterate what i have said before on this point that because tenants buy the homes in which they live and in which they have lived for some time they make neither more nor less of such dwellings available to those who are on any waiting list <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that exposition <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall have better intimation of that when the many forms which i described earlier have been processed and handled but it is no secret that there are great numbers of people who wish to buy as was indicated by the fact that people have sent in a form directly from newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter for the individual authorities and it will be done either way <e> <s> it just depends how they propose to operate the scheme in their individual areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the regulated tenancies procedure regulations which were laid before this house on th october be approved <e> <s> these regulations are concerned with the procedures followed by rent officers <e> <s> schedule i deals with the procedures for registering a fair rent and schedule with the procedures for issuing a certificate of fair rent <e> <s> they amend schedules ii and to the rent act <e> <s> the objective of the changes is to streamline rent officer procedures and to reduce delays affecting the quality of service to the public <e> <s> the proposals flow from a working party consisting primarily of serving rent officers who reported earlier this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i will just quickly cover some of the points made by the noble baroness <e> <s> of course i will gladly write to her and tell her how many mandatory consultations were not attended under the old regime <e> <s> she was concerned that tenants under the new regulations may be afraid to ask for a consultation <e> <s> i do not see why they should be <e> <s> the tenant has full security of tenure under the rent acts and has nothing to fear in asking for a consultation <e> <s> however if there was any hint of a tenant being intimidated which i would condemn just as much as would the noble baroness the rent officer has the reserve power under our proposals to call a consultation himself <e> <s> it is precisely this kind of circumstance which albeit remote has led us to give this discretion to the rent officer <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point i agree that the rent officer must tell the tenant in simple language that he has a right to a consultation and because of this the government will prescribe by law the letter to be sent to the tenant <e> <s> it will be in simple clear language and subject to tonights proceedings we shall lay regulations before the house tomorrow containing the prescribed letter <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness is duly impressed by the expedition brought forth by her suggestion <e> <s> i am sure she would also realise that it was anticipated <e> <s> i should have said this when i responded in the first place <e> <s> i apologise for not so doing <e> <s> as regards the other points she has made as i said we shall consider them carefully and if there are any proposals that are helpful we shall want to take them further <e>", "<cs> my lords i must object strongly to the suggestion that anything at all is being pushed through <e> <s> i come along here in the correct manner i present the regulations in the proper way and they are discussed by the opposition or by any other noble lord who wishes to comment <e> <s> because the noble lord does not stick to procedures with which i am less familiar than he he must not with great respect say that something is being pushed through <e> <s> whatever it is or is not nothing is being pushed through because that seems to imply that in some way there is something underhand about this <e> <s> it is nothing of the kind <e> <s> it is a straightforward alteration of the procedures <e> <s> it is nothing more than that <e> <s> it is an attempt to do things better <e> <s> it is attempting to change the regulations but it is not changing the basics of the act in any way <e> <s> with respect to suggest that something is being pushed through in any way is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm that security is not removed but the noble baroness must not confuse the right to buy which she mentioned and which as she knows has nothing to do with the private sector with the shorthold provisions <e> <s> these are entirely concerned with the private sector <e> <s> i confirm if anyone should still be in doubt that those who have security will not in any way lose it although in the case of shorthold it comes within the term of the agreed new lease <e>", "<cs> my lords there will in fact be publicity as was foreshadowed in the financial and explanatory memorandum to the housing bill <e> <s> it will take the form of press advertisements and in addition an explanatory booklet <e>", "<cs> my lords the short-hold provision as we went into it at great length when we were passing the housing bill here is a new attempt to try to encourage landlords who have hitherto not brought forward their accommodation to do so because they will know that they will get it back after the fixed term within five years <e> <s> we believe that it will bring that accommodation on to the market <e> <s> with great respect to the noble lord lord shinwell the two things are not quite the same <e> <s> certainly his other concern about what the rent officers are doing as regards fixing rents within the rent acts themselves has nothing to do with shorthold which is a totally new concept starting for the first time <e>", "<cs> my lords the act in no way affects the rights of tenants under the previous legislation <e> <s> it does not diminish them one iota and the redress if that is the word for those tenants who are unhappy about the new rents which are now fixed is to go to the rent assessment committees <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the question very seriously indeed <e> <s> it is a serious matter <e> <s> that is why i would repeat that a licence would be required from maff for disposal at sea after loading from a united kingdom port <e> <s> the question of the panamanian flag would not in any way affect that <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the last part of that supplementary because so far as i am aware that has not yet been decided <e> <s> i know and i gladly confirm as my noble friend said that the shipments are those which came in on the vessel to which he referred <e> <s> while repeating what i said to the noble lord lord hale that this is something worthy of watching very carefully i gladly confirm that because it is being so watched there has been proper notification in every way and we shall therefore be very alert to what ultimately transpires <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure where the drugs squad comes into this and i can do no more to help the noble lord than repeat what i said earlier namely that it is a serious matter which we watch very carefully <e> <s> at the same time there are proper commercial transactions which take place and provided there is no breach of any of the stringent and strict regulations which are laid down in this area i think we can at least at the present time be satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to repeal and re-enact with amendments the protection of birds acts to and the conservation of wild creatures and wild plants act to prohibit certain methods of killing or taking wild mammals to restrict the introduction of certain animals and plants to amend the endangered species import and export act to amend the law relating to nature conservation the countryside and national parks and to make provision with respect to the countryside commission to amend the law relating to public rights of way and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely that availability of land is a vital factor in this matter <e> <s> as to what the government are doing we have asked the local authorities to co-operate with housebuilders when asked in carrying out detailed site-by-site studies of just what land is genuinely available for development <e> <s> we have taken powers in the local government planning and land act to ensure that this happens <e> <s> the first of such studies has already been received <e> <s> we have called on the local authorities to maintain a five-year supply of house-building land consistent with development plans at all times <e> <s> we have taken a number of steps to streamline and speed up the planning system including development control in a circular which has just been published <e> <s> in the next few days we shall be laying an order designating the first districts which are to have land registers under new powers in the local government act to ensure that unused and under-used public sector land is identified and released <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i was referring to the circular which emphasised the serious cost to business of planning delays whether due to inefficiency or nit-picking involvement in irrelevant detail <e> <s> the circular urges the need for realism in talking about land supply and puts the onus firmly on the planning authority to provide a good reason for refusing a planning application <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know of the particular wording to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> i would suggest that it is somewhat outside the context of the question but if he likes to take it up with me separately i shall be glad to discuss it with him <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed seized of the need to rehabilitate that is the in term and upgrade the existing standards of dwellings rather than the massive demolition that pertained in the past <e> <s> it would also probably be fair to say that there was in earlier years a greater mass of problems regarding slum clearance than there is now and that the dwellings today are far more likely to be those which will lend themselves to rehabilitation than much of what was demolished in the past <e> <s> in general i agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should make this clear cuts have not been made to the housing associations at all <e> <s> what the government have said is that they are concerned at the possibility of an over-spend of the amount which has been allocated some million <e> <s> it is because of the grave concern to ensure that there is not this over-spend that there is at the present time the moratorium <e> <s> once we have the position clear once we are certain that there will not be an over-spend then everything can continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not blame anything on the high interest rates in my first reply <e> <s> what i said was that as interest rates came down they would help the situation <e> <s> that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot think of anything more likely to lead us to not having a construction industry at all than to do as the noble lord suggests and that is to reverse the policies upon which we are now embarked which most of us feel are the only hope of ensuring that we have the kind of economy that we need <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for putting the question in that way <e> <s> this is for each authority to decide in the light of its own particular circumstances and situation <e> <s> in general terms i entirely agree with what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure quite what the question is <e> <s> if there is no question the noble lord will excuse me if i do not answer <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the observations of the noble baroness lady birk are concerned she said that to continue the moratorium would be outrageous <e> <s> may i just repeat what needs to be said but which apparently has not been said often enough namely that the hips allocation of million has not been cut one penny piece at all <e> <s> the indications which we received at the time of the first returns that came in showing that there was to be a considerable overspend have been entirely justified by the later figures which have come in <e> <s> therefore the intention is to ensure that the total cash limit is not exceeded <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister does not have to get round that <e> <s> he only has to point out that this highlights the enormity of the failure by the previous administration to do what they should have <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness may say that but it is a matter of difference between us <e> <s> if i may turn to the observations made by the noble lord lord wigoder he said that a written answer might have been better <e> <s> need i remind the noble lord that it was only very recently in another place that there was a lot of adverse comment about statements being made in the form of written answers <e> <s> one really cannot win <e>", "<cs> my lords i was sure that the noble lord was aware of it <e> <s> as to his question about how many authorities are affected by the proposals all of them are affected by them to a greater or lesser extent depending upon their current individual situations <e> <s> the noble lord also asked where the cuts were to be made in current expenditure <e> <s> this is part of the rent adjustments <e> <s> some of the details still have to be ironed out <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to write to him with a detailed list <e> <s> i think that the noble lord raised a third point <e> <s> would he refresh my memory <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords last point i do not have the figure <e> <s> however i will include it in the information which i shall give when i write to the noble lord <e> <s> as to the point about contracts which are committed i think it would be helpful if i were to say that the moratorium will not stop authorities from incurring expenditure where they might otherwise be legally liable as a result of contracts already placed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord sandford for his confirmation of what i had said regarding the consultation procedure <e> <s> i listened carefully to what he said about a further relaxation in the moratorium and took special note of his plea that renovations should be allowed <e> <s> i will gladly discuss this point with my right honourable friend <e> <s> his observations on rent increases generally supported the points which i had made and i thank my noble friend for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard what my noble friend has said on this <e> <s> i am quite sure that the exhortations we have been making about planning have not as yet had the whole effect we would want them to have <e> <s> i will look carefully into what has been happening currently and if i can be of help i need hardly say that i shall be glad to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole study of housing finance is in fact an ongoing process <e> <s> it is something that never seems to stop <e> <s> there are so many factors each year almost each month that concern housing finance <e> <s> i do assure my noble friend that it is not a subject where one can say we have sorted this one out for the moment and we can leave it <e> <s> it just never stops <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that those questions roamed very far from the original question but i entirely understand that the noble baroness would not want to pass up an opportunity to make an observation on this matter and i of course respect that <e> <s> i would only say on the question of fairness between the sectors that owner-occupiers mortgage outgoings and hence their tax relief depend on the price they actually paid for their own houses whereas local authority subsidies are based on historic costs and are pooled <e> <s> so there is no unambiguous way of comparing the two and i am sure that the noble baroness would not want me to start to dissertate on the record of what labour did as regards housing subsidies and records <e>", "<cs> my lords for the reasons that i have just given the answer is no <e>", "<cs> my lords one would have to look at the whole of the way in which other countries manage their housing affairs and that is something which as i have said previously we look at all of the time <e> <s> there are some examples such as west germany where the extent of private sector accommodation is far far greater than exists in this country <e> <s> indeed perhaps if we had followed some of the same kind of policies as they have followed to encourage that situation we should be in the same position and a happy position it would be <e> <s> so i would say to my noble friend that yes there is of course scope to look at this whole area and indeed we must look at it the whole of the time and i assure him that we shall do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that i shall have to become used to being called a villain along with others and it really does not trouble me too much <e> <s> however what i must be concerned about is that i try to ensure that we do that which we see as right and best in the interests of everyone concerned <e> <s> having said that i entirely accept that private tenants do not get the same form of financial support as owner-occupiers or public tenants but substantial rent allowances are available to help meet private tenants housing costs and in the financial year ending march million was made available in rent allowances <e>", "<cs> my lords co-operative housing certainly has a part to play and i have always felt that it was one of the forms that we should follow in housing <e> <s> so i take the point made by the noble lord without question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i believe that it is something of a break with tradition for the government to introduce legislation of this kind on subjects which have been well cared for in the past by private members bills <e> <s> the cause of nature conservation has been well-served in the past by the efforts of voluntary organisations and their parliamentary supporters and by the willing co-operation of landowners and farmers <e> <s> we intend that the bill should promote and assist such activities not replace them by a plethora of controls on countryside activities <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i deal with the points raised by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> he said that not one local authority association in the country will approve of the statement <e> <s> well of course there are only three <e> <s> i do not know whether they will approve or not but it is important that they should know what line the government have been taking <e> <s> there has been tremendous consultation all the way down the line <e> <s> indeed it has been the local authority associations themselves who have been helping through their grants working group and in many other ways in coming to these conclusions <e> <s> so of course no one will approve of anything that reduces the amount of money that they have been given and to that extent i suppose that the noble lord is correct <e> <s> whether or not they will approve the final equity of the distribution is something upon which i cannot comment <e> <s> i suspect that they will not all disapprove of that <e>", "<cs> of course my lords but the sins are so many that who could deny me the chance to comment on them <e> <s> as to the virtues only time will tell <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a statement <e> <s> i am trying to respond <e> <s> i am probably being over-long but i am trying to reply as briefly as i can <e> <s> i am sure there will be many other occasions for further debate on that <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon made a very important point which i should like to comment on <e> <s> he asked what is being done for the special problem areas <e> <s> i would answer that by saying that the whole basis of assessment of need is in fact assessing the need of the problem areas <e> <s> if they have greater needs and in many cases they have then this should be taken care of in what we used to call the needs assessment <e> <s> it then became standard expenditure and now has the title of grant-related expenditure <e> <s> in that way there is an attempt here to make allowance for that <e> <s> the noble lord will also know that in the worst areas the partnership and programme authorities there is urban money which goes to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not rejoice at all in any way <e> <s> perhaps i am able to comment upon local government since the reorganisation as much as the noble lord himself having worked in it for some years as i did <e> <s> we probably should not quarrel too much between us about many aspects of that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says we made a mess of it that is a matter of opinion <e> <s> then the noble lord lord beaumont said what he did about equal punishment <e> <s> if by the word punish he means more or less grant let me say this <e> <s> the figures announced are figures based on the assessment of need and relate against base figures which have had to be calculated because this is a new system and now every authority receives its grant direct whereas before it was done in another way <e> <s> that is why we have had to make calculations <e> <s> but at the end of the day block grant will come into effect not at this stage but at the point when rates are fixed when spending is decided <e> <s> that will be the time when it comes into effect <e> <s> this has to do with grant-related expenditure as a basis of apportionment of this finite sum of grant <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that what matters at the end of the day is the amount that affects the ratepayer <e> <s> if there is this adjustment between the counties and districts it was so within the last three years i think that there was a massive switch of some million in adjusting the apportionments <e> <s> that figure is subject to verification <e> <s> two years ago there was a great shift from the counties to the districts the shire districts we are talking about and not the metropolitan districts and it was done on a totally arbitrary basis as the then secretary of state said <e> <s> he said there is no basis on which i can justify this it is something which i think i should do <e> <s> now at last as part of the attempt to get some semblance of reasonableness into the way in which grant is distributed there is a shift to the counties from the shire districts <e> <s> but at the end of the day when the ratepayer has to be affected by what is levied the two are added together <e> <s> so if county a receives a net gain and districts within its county have a net loss then when it comes to fixing the rate the two are added together <e> <s> therefore the effect on the ratepayer as such should not be adverse <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope noble lords will not think that the assumptions i made earlier were unrealistic because if that is so what hope does the country have if people are not prepared to work within the totality of what government feel can be <e>", "<cs> my lords in no way do i accept the point that the governments policies have imposed special problems on camden <e> <s> the fact is that in assessing need and in looking at the grant-related expenditure assessments the factors that the noble baroness has mentioned along with many others are of course considered <e>", "<cs> my lords capital allocations will be announced in the next two or three days <e> <s> the indi <e>", "<cs> my lords first i by no means agree that the rsg is now incomprehensible or unpredictable <e> <s> if i only look at what happened in the past i am astonished at its clarity <e> <s> would that it were more so <e> <s> as to whether there will be dampeners multipliers call them what you like yes there will be safety nets <e>", "<cs> dampeners multipliers yes my lords <e> <s> there will be multipliers as well <e> <s> for noble lords who may feel that this is a technical new word dampeners is a word which means that you spread out over a period of time the impact of something that you may do <e> <s> in terms of this subject that is what it means <e> <s> as to whether the rates will be in single figures i shall be very surprised and very disappointed if there are not very many authorities who vote for single figures <e> <s> certainly if they stick to the numbers that we have mentioned and which we have been talking about today there will be every opportunity for them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly not aware that that is the case <e> <s> the circular so far as it refers to the aesthetic aspects has been welcomed by architects <e> <s> i do not know at all that there has been the disadvantageous impact upon planning authorities to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i can do no better than to quote from paragraph which i think answers my noble friend i hope to his satisfaction <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that that is the case <e> <s> i hear what the noble lord says and will make inquiries <e> <s> as to interpretation the circular is there for everyone to see <e> <s> if there have been any doubts about it then hopefully what i have said today will help clear them up <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right but the same principles apply <e> <s> the purpose of the circular is to ensure that applications are speeded up and that there is no delay <e> <s> delay causes great concern <e> <s> nevertheless i agree with the point the noble lord made regarding other areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that there will be an opportunity to debate it in this house <e> <s> i am not sure of the procedural priorities or ways but i am quite sure that in one way or another someone will ensure that it is debated in your lordships house <e> <s> i have every confidence in that <e> <s> i hope that i have been able in the short time available to set out at least the key principles of the governments transport policy <e> <s> the motion of the noble viscount lord sidmouth implies that there is no transport policy <e> <s> may i respectfully suggest that that might be said by many who would disagree with the policy <e> <s> a transport policy we certainly have and it is clear and coherent <e> <s> furthermore i submit that it is an enlightened and progressive policy <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think that that is a fair observation <e> <s> it is one of the reasons why we have allocated more money this time than we did previously <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is a method of energy conservation and it is also a matter of great importance <e> <s> i think that we have shown that we feel that way about it by the introduction of the home insulation scheme which we introduced in with the various adjust <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the exact time but i can say that the time lag between applications being made for an allocation and the firm application for the grant itself has been one of the problems that have caused administrative difficulties <e> <s> that is why we have now introduced what we call the four-month rule whereby if you apply and are given an allocation but do not take it up within four months the money is made available elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a current advertising campaign to give publicity to what is available and we are continuing with that campaign <e> <s> if the noble lord would like me to let him have details of the whole of the spending and of the direction in which it is going i would be very glad to let him have them <e>", "<cs> no my lords what i said was that if anyone wishes to draw to my attention any authority which is in particular difficulty at present i would be glad to take the matter up <e>", "<cs> at the beginning of this committee stage i think i should say that i shall be resisting many of lord mottistones amendments <e> <s> i owe him a brief word of explanation <e> <s> i fully share his desire that of the cbi and other interested bodies to get this technical and specialised bill right in detail <e> <s> i am indeed grateful for the time and effort which they have given to help us to achieve this <e> <s> however by the time the bill was introduced these discussions had been going on for a considerable time <e> <s> as i am sure my noble friend knows many of their comments have already been incorporated in the bill <e> <s> of course there is inevitably still room for improvement <e> <s> i have put down a number of government amendments most of which arise out of our continuing consultations <e>", "<cs> i do not know that there is much that i can add to what i have already said <e> <s> i indicated that i had some sympathy with the objective of the amendment because the provision is a very wide one but i think that in the circumstances i would want to stick with the position as i have already outlined it <e>", "<cs> as i said in opening the second reading debate i fully recognise that clause encompasses rather more than is necessary <e> <s> however as i said then i think the best way of narrowing this down is through amendments to the general development order <e> <s> there is already a class of permitted development in the gdo which deals with the winning and working of minerals for the purposes of agriculture and if my noble friends would agree i think the neatest way of covering the point raised in this amendment would be by amending this class of the gdo <e> <s> i have already given an assurance which i gladly repeat that this clause will not be brought into operstion <e>", "<cs> i shall have to get used at this early stage to finding myself in agreement with the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> it is quite a novel experience for me and it makes a difference <e> <s> may i say at once that i am glad to be able to tell my noble friend and indeed the noble baroness that i accept in principle the extension of planning control to the removal of material from some of the matters listed in my noble friends amendment although i wonder whether and this is a point to which my noble friend lord gisborough referred the reference to disused road embankments is really necessary since i should have thought that the very few cases which exist would hence become part of the land <e>", "<cs> i had better get used at once to the feeling that the table tennis ball must have of being in between the parties <e> <s> i am sure that this will not take me too long <e> <s> i hear what my noble friend says and i am aware of his general concern and of his position in these matters <e>", "<cs> the government are in sympathy with the intention of the amendment <e> <s> we are conscious that this clause is wide <e> <s> this is necessary because of the difficulties involved in drafting the clause so as to distinguish between things we want to bring under control for example the reworking of large waste heaps and those which we do not such as the movement of stockpiles around a quarry site or the use by farmers of minerals on their own land for their own purposes <e>", "<cs> we have considered the point raised by my noble friends amendment but in our view we think that it is unnecessary <e> <s> it is considered that in scottish law any interest in minerals is an interest in the land containing the minerals <e> <s> for that reason the bill contains no scottish equivalents to clauses and which set out in the compensation context that an interest in minerals shall be treated in the same way as an interest in land <e> <s> we feel that the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will accept this <e>", "<cs> as i suspected a solomon-like posture is clearly called for on this issue and i suspect on many others before we are finished with this bill <e> <s> quite clearly there are important points of view on both sides <e> <s> when experts like my noble friend lord boardman and others speak on the interests of the industry their considerable experience must be listened to very carefully <e> <s> at the same time they would be the first to acknowledge that the concerns of those who are interested in the environmental aspects also are very important <e> <s> i think it is very gratifying in many ways that the government have finally come forward with a bill which is trying to strike a balance to grasp the nettle and to take on board these differences and try to get somewhere <e>", "<cs> as the amendment stands i am afraid that i cannot accept it <e> <s> where for example is the provision referred to to be made <e> <s> in the development plan <e> <s> are planning authorities to cater only for their own needs and not for wider requirements <e> <s> this latter point would go against so much of the good which has happened in recent years in the regional co-operation between the industry local authorities and central government <e> <s> as drafted the amendment is also defective in its reference to mineral planning authorities as these are not defined in the scottish part of the bill <e> <s> but even if these points were corrected i wonder whether this amendment is really necessary <e> <s> do planning authorities need to have this additional duty placed on them when they already have a duty to make proper planning provision for their area including housing employment and mineral working <e>", "<cs> this re-opens a debate that we had before and i hope that it comes as no surprise to my noble friend lord mottistone that in fact i cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> i suspect that it does not come as a surprise to him because he will recall the extent to which we debated this at the time and how the government went to such great lengths in this part of the local government planning and land act to draw a balance yet again between the functions of the counties and those of the districts <e> <s> that was another no-win situation if i may so call it where we could not satisfy everyone we were bound to be wrong somewhere <e>", "<cs> there may be cases where mineral working is being carried out without an express grant of planning permission including cases where working began before the onset of planning control <e> <s> it is clearly necessary in our view to review these workings so that the possibility of imposing up-to-date environmental or restoration conditions can be considered <e> <s> i accept that in some but not all of these cases enforcement action could provide an alternative procedure <e>", "<cs> i said that i think that we ought to consider what my noble friend has said and that i gladly undertake to do <e>", "<cs> i would just say here that there are two reasons why we are unhappy about this amendment <e> <s> first we believe that there are some mineral operations which are being carried out without an expressed grant of planning permission because for example they predate planning control <e> <s> if it is necessary to update <e>", "<cs> there is little i can add to what i said on the previous amendment the situation is the same and we do not want to accept this amendment for the reasons i gave <e> <s> however we wish to see whether my noble friend can come at this in another way in which case we should be glad to look at it <e>", "<cs> briefly i am sympathetic to the point made by the noble baroness <e> <s> perhaps she will leave the point with us so that we may consider whether the amendment achieves the object in the best way <e> <s> we will certainly want to take it up along these lines <e>", "<cs> i am aware that the industry considers that the procedure outlined in lines to is an unnecessary complication but it is considered essential that some means of consulting owners of excluded minerals should be provided <e> <s> having said that we have some sympathy with the industrys view that the procedure outlined is complicated and we are looking to see whether a simpler procedure can be devised <e> <s> i therefore tell my noble friend that we want to consider the matter further with that in mind but i think it essential that owners of excluded minerals should be notified of minerals applications which could directly affect their interests <e> <s> however i gladly undertake to take the matter away and consider it <e>", "<cs> i am saying that the point made here is sufficient for us to consider the wording as we have it at the moment <e> <s> while doing that we shall look to see whether we are satisfied as we were when we originally drafted the provision <e> <s> i think that we probably are still satisfied but i should want to look at the point <e>", "<cs> this proposal goes well beyond anything arising directly out of stevens <e> <s> there is a good deal of logic in the proposition that where maff or the forestry commission is being consulted on the terms of an aftercare condition it should also be consulted on the terms of the restoration condition and on how well it has been complied with <e> <s> however there are a number of other considerations <e> <s> i should have thought that the industry would be likely to oppose this given its reaction to consultation on aftercare conditions and its opposition is likely to be even stronger since this consultation would take place regardless of whether or not it was sensible to impose an aftercare condition <e> <s> however i should like to have an opportunity to examine the full implications of this proposal in the light of what my noble friend has said and therefore i say forthwith that i shall gladly take it away to consider <e>", "<cs> let me say at once that i entirely accept that the drafting of the bill needs to be extended to cover progressive restoration <e> <s> i shall be moving an amendment later to deal with these points and i hope that with that assurance my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall be very glad indeed to write to my noble friend and give him what i am sure will be a lengthy and comprehensive definition <e>", "<cs> while it is reasonable to expect an operator to bring land back to the standard required for agriculture or forestry we think that the amendment as it is in front of us is too wide in that it could lead to requirements for other purposes <e> <s> i know this is not the intention of the noble baroness she said as much <e> <s> nevertheless it could be interpreted in this way <e> <s> while speaking may i say that i am covering points which come in amendments nos <e> <s> and and my noble friend lord gisborough referred to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that my noble friend lord mottistone is so concerned <e> <s> i thought that it would be extremely helpful to everyone to know what types of operation we have in mind <e> <s> i hear his concern i cannot do anything about it <e> <s> i shall watch for anything he comes forward with but for the moment i shall still move the amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot add a great deal <e> <s> i note carefully what the noble baroness has said and indeed i note what my noble friend lord mottistone has said but i can really add nothing to my earlier remarks <e>", "<cs> i recognise and indeed i have recognised all the time that there is some doubt among agriculturists about whether five years after-care will prove to be sufficient <e> <s> that is why we have taken care to amend the period if the need should arise <e> <s> once again the government are trying to strike a fair balance here <e> <s> at present we think that the five-year period proposed by stevens is the right one and i hope that the noble baroness will understand the thinking behind this <e>", "<cs> in commenting upon this amendment i should like also to comment on the points referred to in amendments nos <e> <s> and and simply say that the government consider it is essential to restore agricultural land once mineral working has ceased <e> <s> however my noble friends points are valid <e> <s> i am conscious of the practical difficulties arising from the current drafting and i gladly give him an assurance that we will study how this might be improved <e>", "<cs> i hope all this reads better than it sounds <e> <s> it is very difficult to follow <e> <s> there is a principle behind this amendment and we shall want to consider it again <e> <s> if we think as we do at the moment that there is merit in these points we shall have to consider how best to meet them and will want to do so in consultation with colleagues <e> <s> we shall probably take up the point in considering the redrafting of subsection <e>", "<cs> this amendment has implications for planning control generally <e> <s> it would for the first time impose a statutory duty on a planning authority to consult an applicant on the terms of a condition which they intend to impose in the grant of a planning permission <e> <s> many authorities already do this on a voluntary basis in mineral cases <e> <s> but in any case the applicant when submitting the application is generally well aware of the issues likely to be covered in conditions <e> <s> an applicant who regards any conditions imposed as unreasonable has the right of appeal to the secretary of state under section of the town and country planning act <e> <s> the secretary of state has the power to discharge the condition or to impose such other conditions as he thinks reasonable <e> <s> if we were to accept this amendment it would require that is the operative word authorities to consult applicants before imposing an after-care condition on a planning permission for a mineral working and that is farther than we would want to go <e>", "<cs> this amendment too has important implications for planning generally <e> <s> planning authorities are not at present required to consult owners of land as i said on the previous amendment on the terms of conditions on planning permissions <e> <s> however by virtue of section of the act all owners are notified of applications for planning permission in respect of their land and can make representations to the local planning authority <e> <s> this seems to me to give good opportunity for them to make their views known on the terms of any conditions which are likely to be imposed if planning permission is granted <e>", "<cs> i entirely take that point but the fact that the owner is notified of an application and has the <e>", "<cs> if i may refer first to a i feel that the amendment is somewhat ambiguous <e> <s> there is no question that we are seeking to bring agriculture under planning control <e> <s> all that the bill does is to provide for certain restoration operations of an agricultural <e>", "<cs> i do not think i have listened to siren voices in the past and i am not likely to be doing so at this stage from whatever direction they may come <e> <s> the fact is that we consider that this clause is another of the most important clauses in the bill <e> <s> the stevens committee recommended that county planning authorities should be empowered to require a period of five years after-care when mineral working has ceased and the land has been restored <e> <s> this recommendation is accepted by the government <e> <s> if land which is to be restored to agriculture or forestry is to achieve its full potential we believe it is essential that local authorities should be able to impose conditions of this nature <e> <s> i do not believe that it is enough to rely on voluntary agreements with good operators to meet this need <e>", "<cs> i have to say that planning authorities in scotland already consult the department of agriculture and fisheries for scotland informally on planning case work affecting agricultural land including restoration following mineral working under well-established administrative arrangements <e> <s> it would be anomalous to introduce a statutory requirement in relation only to minerals after-care conditions <e> <s> there is no such anomaly in the provision for statutory consultation in england and wales since there is an existing statutory requirement not paralleled in scotland for local planning authorities south of the border to consult the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food about proposed development affecting agricultural land in certain cases <e> <s> the bill is consistent in that it recognises the different arrangements which are already in force on both sides of the border <e> <s> i listened to what my noble friend said on this and he recognised this point <e> <s> i wonder if on reflection he would feel that with this explanation he would wish not to press this amendment <e>", "<cs> i entirely accept that this provision is retrospective but in the circumstances i do not consider that unreasonable <e> <s> in the interests of proper planning minerals permissions cannot have an indefinite life or final restoration may never be achieved <e> <s> there has been pressure for a much shorter period and we have had to try to strike a balance <e> <s> i consider that years is fairer to mineral operators <e> <s> it is one of these parts of this bill where one tries to strike a balance in what is the right period of time <e> <s> i think this is a fair period and that is why we are inclined to stick to the point on this issue <e>", "<cs> i too should like to say that we must not lose sight of the fact that the operators the industry are playing a role here which is really extremely important <e> <s> the intentions of the bill which are essentially following the way of the environmentalists and rightly so is one matter but it would be quite wrong for us not to take up the point that my noble friend lord nugent made earlier in the proceedings when he stressed that the industry is performing a service which is absolutely vital to us <e> <s> in all our deliberations we must not overlook that at all i <e>", "<cs> i thought that i had spoken to this amendment when i spoke earlier to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i clearly have not changed my position since then <e> <s> i understand my noble friends feelings <e> <s> i commiserate with them but i cannot go any further than i did previously <e>", "<cs> i understand that the purpose of this amendment is to dispense with the need to apply section to mineral workings and therefore rely on <e>", "<cs> once again we are back on this bill and back to the balancing act that seems to be required as we go along <e> <s> of course as the noble baroness has just said there are the points of view of those who would like the period to be less than two years <e> <s> it is absolutely true that the government have moved from the stevens recommended six months to months and then to two years but this is because we have had consultations <e> <s> it is an attempt to try to meet the genuine concern which the industry has which i think is it proper that we should consider while trying to achieve the environmental and other benefits <e>", "<cs> obviously i would want to look into the point which my noble friend has raised <e> <s> that i undertake to do <e> <s> but on the amendment i cannot help him <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that this amendment would destroy much of the purpose of prohibition orders <e> <s> they are intended to cover precisely those circumstances where an operator has effectively abandoned a working before the reserves are substantially exhausted and where for that reason restoration conditions have not become operative <e> <s> the problem of the half-worked chalk pits in thurrock is an example of what i have in mind <e>", "<cs> the question that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter asks is really at the nub of what this amendment and the intention in the bill are all about <e> <s> i would submit that the amendment is not necessary to achieve what my noble friend who has <e>", "<cs> it might help if i were to make two observations <e> <s> first if the main intention of putting in the word reasonable is to make people pause and think in the way my noble friend suggested then i submit that the fact of there being an opportunity to take the matter further in certain circumstances to the secretary of state is of itself an equal restraining factor on those who might be inclined to make decisions in an arbitrary way and one is really as good as the other <e> <s> secondly it might help my noble friend to know that the word reasonable does not appear in section of the town and country planning act relating to planning conditions <e> <s> i accept that my noble friends intention here is not to do anything sinister but merely to strike a cautionary note to those who are deciding these matters <e> <s> if that is so then what we have in the bill achieves that purpose <e> <s> i do not think he need have any fears on that score and perhaps he will agree not to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> a requirement depending on what it is can be very onerous indeed <e> <s> it is the nature of the requirement that is the arbitor in deciding how significant it is but i feel we are getting rather into semantics now <e> <s> i still think my noble friends fears are unfounded in that we cover the point which concerns him <e>", "<cs> as i said in relation to amendments nos <e> <s> and the government consider it essential to restore agricultural land once mineral working has ceased <e> <s> however i am conscious of the practical difficulties arising from the current drafting and we are studying how this might be improved <e> <s> i am obliged to my noble friend for bringing this matter forward and i assure him that we are looking carefully at it <e>", "<cs> as i said in relation to the earlier amendment i accept the principle behind this amendment and i gladly confirm that in consultation with colleagues we shall consider how best to meet it <e>", "<cs> i have much sympathy with the intention behind the amendment <e> <s> unfortunately however it seems quite clear that it would not be sensible for the secretary of state to substitute a suspension order for a prohibition order as suggested <e> <s> a prohibition order is intended to deal with permanent closure and any new conditions imposed are likely to relate to restoration <e> <s> a suspension order relates to a temporary situation and the conditions required are to ensure the tidying-up of the site <e>", "<cs> it really is very difficult for me agreeing <e>", "<cs> we propose to deal with this point in a somewhat different way <e> <s> one of my amendments to clause is intended to meet the point and in the circumstances perhaps my noble friend will not wish to press this amendment <e>", "<cs> this is really going over the same points as i made before <e> <s> it is a question of striking a balance between two opposing points of view and yet getting that which is right in any case <e> <s> we think that what we have in the bill now is right and therefore i cannot accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> when listening to my noble friend lord mottistone i did not think that he was implying that which was ascribed to him by the noble baroness that he was saying that the cbi was right on all these matters and that the environmentalists were wrong <e> <s> i did not interpret what he said in that way <e> <s> i thought the points made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter were very powerful points indeed it would be a very odd government who were not concerned at any time most of all at this time as to anything that might have an adverse effect upon industry or any section of it <e> <s> i am anxious about this amendment and about all the others of a like nature referring to the time that must be given to industry <e> <s> in fact during the negotiations my information is that the cbi thought that months was a reasonable period <e>", "<cs> it seems to

implications to make sure that there are no other problems <e> <s> i undertake to consider this amendment <e>", "<cs> suspension orders are intended as a temporary measure only to protect the environment while mineral working is suspended <e> <s> there may well be occasions on which it would be sensible to up-date or remove some requirements in less than two years and i cannot therefore accept this amendment <e> <s> if a suspension order or supplementary suspension order is not confirmed for example because of a procedural flaw it would be wrong not to have the opportunity of making a new order for another two years <e> <s> and even where an order has been confirmed circumstances can change in less than two years which could necessitate amending the requirements of the suspension order <e> <s> i hope that when my noble friend has considered <e>", "<cs> i am advised that this amendment moved by my noble friend is unnecessary <e> <s> section of the local land charges act provides that where under other acts orders are made local land charges the provisions of the act shall apply <e> <s> a local land charge is automatically a charge for the purposes of the land charges act <e> <s> that is the position as i am clearly advised <e> <s> if it should be that my noble friend can bring forth some evidence or reference that would seem to indicate to the contrary i should be glad to look at it <e> <s> however i am told that the amendment is not necessary <e>", "<cs> there is not a great deal to say on this <e> <s> we are not clear in fact why the industry are opposed to these provisions which we would have thought were very much in their interests <e> <s> these subsections are designed to cover the circumstances where an operator claims to have restarted work but the mineral planning authority does not accept that work has genuinely restarted <e> <s> i would have thought that an appeal to the secretary of state seems a sensible way to resolve such a dispute should it arise <e> <s> i say again that i would have thought it would have been in the industrys interests to have it <e> <s> all i can say is that if my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i entirely accept that this

discontinuance of a use of land and to impose conditions on the continuance of a use <e> <s> section which is among other things concerned with the enforcement of orders made under section must be related to the use of land and not its development <e> <s> with that clarification of what seems to have been not too clear perhaps my noble friend will feel able to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i will speak to this amendment and its scottish equivalent amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i must confess that until i heard my noble friend moving the amendment i did not fully understand its purpose <e> <s> under the existing town and country planning legislation if steps required by a section order requiring the removal or alteration of buildings works plant

to be reasonable and which may require further clarification <e> <s> yes of course i shall be glad to do that <e>", "<cs> i am happy to tell my noble friend that the government accept the principle behind the amendment and recognise that it seeks to remedy one unintended consequence of earlier legislation <e> <s> the lawyers are looking closely at how best this can be done <e> <s> if my noble friend will agree to withdraw his amendment i shall table a government amendment before report <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord nugent has been good enough at second reading and subsequently to give a full exposition as to why he feels that the course of action set out in this amendment is necessary <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i will reply at the same time both to this amendment and to no <e> <s> which is also in the name of my noble friend <e> <s> taken together they would have the effect of providing that where compensation became payable as a result of the making of one of the four orders provided in this bill the mineral planning authority paying the compensation would be able to obtain complete reimbursement from the government <e> <s> as i said earlier i have a great deal of sympathy with the view that more should be done to restore sites where mineral working has been completed <e> <s> indeed that is why this bill is being introduced in the first place <e> <s> and it has generally been recognised that the first part of the cost of any such restoration should be borne by the mining and quarrying industry <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend decides how to deal with his amendment i should like to make one or two very brief comments <e> <s> first in case any members of your lordships committee are not aware of the situation it should be made quite clear that the government give per cent <e> <s> derelict land grant to local authorities which decide on that priority and wish to carry out the work <e> <s> that applies in all the assisted areas and it is for the local authorities to decide whether such work is to have priority <e> <s> the noble baroness was touching on something else which i mentioned when we discussed the previous amendment of my noble friend lord nugent <e> <s> but i think that the point i now mention ought to be made <e>", "<cs> that is my understanding of the position <e>", "<cs> i hear with interest what the noble lord lord fletcher says and i know that he will understand that we are now moving forward into a <e>", "<cs> the amendments are concerned to ensure that byways open to all traffic are covered in two places in clause where reference is currently made only to public paths public paths consist of course of footpaths and bridleways <e> <s> the objective is to enable definitive maps and statements to be modified by the addition of byways <e> <s> unfortunately these amendments rest on a misconception which i shall try to explain <e>", "<cs> as the bill stands local authorities are free to reclassify again those roads used as public paths which they downgraded to bridleways or footpaths as a result of the application of the suitability or hardship tests <e> <s> since these tests have now been discarded it is clearly right that they should have the opportunity to apply the sole remaining test of vehicular rights to those ways <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that that was so <e> <s> yes i think i would agree with that <e> <s> the proceedings on the bill are perhaps taking longer than might have been expected though i must point out that this is the first bill with which i have been concerned that has started in this house apart from the minerals bill <e> <s> i feel that it is quite proper that the kind of consideration that has to be given to the bill should be more prolonged than would be the consideration of a bill on which there had previously been deliberations in another place <e> <s> there is nothing at all wrong in this situation but there is a difficulty in that your lordships house has to push on with its business <e> <s> this is a long and contentious bill and for that reason in response to my noble friend i make the point that i imagine that what he says is right <e> <s> however should it upon reflection and following reading and i assure the committee that there will be much reading be considered that there is a contra view i shall be in touch with my noble friend to tell him so <e>", "<cs> yes that was indeed what i said <e> <s> so far as i am aware and i qualify all that i say on this clause the position is precisely that the local authority has the absolute discretion with the one <e>", "<cs> i have no reason to think that it does <e> <s> i am advised that the position is as i have stated <e>", "<cs> alas <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that these amendments are designed to apply to the new review procedure a provision which limits the evidence which authorities can at present take into account in considering the downgrading or deletion of ways shown in definitive <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances of the extreme case i would have thought that that is something that the authority who had to decide on re-opening would take into account <e> <s> if i was called upon to decide whether or not to re-open i should want to know why <e> <s> if that which was put to me sounded reasonable i would proceed <e>

that is how i would see it <e>", "<cs> as i hope i illustrated by my response to the last amendment i am by no means unsympathetic to the problems of the farmers and the landowners faced with the situation described in the first part of the amendment <e> <s> i am bound to question the extent of the problem and whether it justifies such measures <e> <s> acquisition by the public of a right of passage over land by implied dedication is a well established principle of common and statute law <e> <s> its curtailment whatever the origins of the initial use is not a matter which should be taken lightly <e> <s> i cannot lend my support to this part of the amendment <e> <s> moreover it would be difficult for authorities in the face of allegations to the contrary to tell with absolute certainty that the initial <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend comments with respect to the noble lord lord houghton it is not that basis at all on which we came to the conclusion that we have about this amendment <e> <s> i am anxious to watch carefully for the interests of all concerned of one side as another <e> <s> it would be wrong not to recognise that farmers have a very very important role to play <e> <s> we must be very careful about anything that we may do to impinge upon their activities <e> <s> we must be careful about that <e> <s> for that reason i am not unsympathetic to whatever they bring forward <e> <s> i shall listen as carefully as i can just as i shall do with users as well <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will not feel that anything i have said is in any way because of any views we have as such it is because we are trying to get the best bill we can <e>", "<cs> i should hate to disturb my noble friend <e> <s> i do not recall having referred at all to a period of years <e> <s> i said that the second part of the amendment was superfluous that evidence of this would be admissible in determining the status of a right of way and that there is no need for a specific provision requiring authorities to have regard to it <e> <s> i said that and i repeat it now <e> <s> i am not sure whether the implications of that are very far reaching as far as my noble friend is concerned but that is the position <e>", "<cs> so far as i recall interpreting this i think that is right <e>", "<cs> i cannot answer this but like so many of the other things we have been talking about clearly we shall take careful note of all that is said and should it be necessary we will look at things again <e> <s> i think i have given an exposition of the facts as they are and i do not think i can help my noble friend any further <e> <s> i am sorry <e>", "<cs> i shall not say much on this amendment <e> <s> i am prepared to give further consideration to this question on the understanding that my right honourable friend the secretary of state is not involved and that it will be possible to protect authorities against frivolous or repetitious claims which do not introduce any new information <e> <s> your lordships may care to note that the informal committee on rights of way matters which my honourable friend michael spicer chairs has the problem under consideration <e> <s> in the circumstances i would invite the noble lord to withdraw his amendment <e> <s> the matter is being considered by the spicer committee and we will take it away and consider it <e>", "<cs> i am very sympathetic to the points which my noble friend makes <e> <s> who would not be <e> <s> there is much validity in the concern which he expresses but i would respectfully submit that the amendment is not necessary in that highway authorities already have the necessary powers under section of the road traffic regulation act to impose by way of traffic regulation orders speed limits on any highway under their control <e> <s> these powers extend to byways open to all traffic <e> <s> i am confident that authorities would not hesitate to use them in appropriate circumstances <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether the road humps bill which is in another place at present would in any way affect this issue <e> <s> i do not think that it would be a matter which would make me wish to change my mind so far as this amendment is concerned <e>", "<cs> i am concerned about the matter of enforcement <e> <s> i am not at all sure about how that could be done and at the end of the day i think it would have to be for the highway authority to decide <e> <s> i am sympathetic because i know the kind of problems that this can bring but i think it is not necessary to do anything along the lines suggested and in any case the problems attached to it would mean that i could not accept the amendment as it stands <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong the proceedings by making a lengthy clause stand part speech <e> <s> i have one here before me but i feel it is not what i should be doing at this stage <e> <s> so far as the point raised by the noble lord lord houghton is concerned i should say there is in fact no way in which a footpath can be converted into a right of way for vehicular traffic <e> <s> i do not think there is anything much i want to add <e> <s> i commend the clause to your lordships <e> <s> it may not go as far as all would like but then if it did it would probably arouse some antagonisms as i have noted this bill to do in the past on other matters from other sources <e> <s> i think again that it draws a balance and i commend it to the committee <e>", "<cs> i well understand that in some instances preliminary consultation may be desirable but i am far from convinced that a specific requirement is necessary <e> <s> the bills provisions will in fact enable landowners to take steps to safeguard their interest <e> <s> that is ensured by the requirement to notify them of orders affecting their property <e>", "<cs> the bill provides for preliminary consultation with other local authorities that is district and parish councils because of their familiarity with the public rights of way in their areas <e> <s> i recognise the importance of consultation wherever that is possible <e> <s> but there is a point beyond which we cannot go because once we do that we open up the whole area of who ought to be consulted in every instance indeed this is the point made by the noble baroness lady david with which i have sympathy <e> <s> of course we shall read everything that has been said but i very much doubt whether we could help my noble friend on this occasion <e>", "<cs> this amendment has clearly been inspired by the frequent delays that have occurred in recent times in the publication and distribution of the <e>", "<cs> i am not opposed in principle to the substance of the amendment <e> <s> indeed it is a feature of the alternative procedure for publicising these and public path creation diversion and extinguishment orders recently presented to the government by michael spicers informal rights of way committee <e> <s> these proposals have been accepted in general by the government and appropriate amendments to schedules and will be tabled at a later stage <e> <s> in those circumstances the noble lord may be prepared to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord melchett acknowledged the amendments are aimed primarily at frustrating the intended transfer to the local authorities of the responsibility for the determination of disputed proposals to amend definitive maps and statements <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me as i allowed him to develop my argument then i will come to the points he raised and answer them i hope but i think what i have to say on this aspect of it needs to be said to put the matter into proper context <e> <s> that is that what we are concerned with here is the establishment of a factual record of public rights of way not whether a right of way ought to exist but whether it does exist <e> <s> we are concerned with the ascertainment of facts <e> <s> does the secretary of state really need to be involved in this exercise <e> <s> are we really saying that local authorities cannot be entrusted with this task <e> <s> it is not as if in relation to definitive maps they have any axe to grind <e> <s> it is not even a matter on which they can exercise discretion once the facts have been established <e> <s> if evidence is brought that a right of way exists they have no choice but to put it on the map <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me i am coming to that point as well <e> <s> indeed it is the very next point that i want to make <e> <s> i understand the point that is being made and i think that the noble lord lord nathan also touched on this is that public rights of way are far from being a local matter because of the extent to which they are used by persons who are not resident in the locality <e> <s> with the exception of designated long-distance routes which in any event serve a specific purpose and require specific approval the primary purpose of the path network is to serve both functional and recreational needs of the local community <e> <s> their use by visitors from outside the area does not mean that local needs should be subordinated or that the responsibility for the final say in these matters should not rest with the elected representatives of the local community <e> <s> i think that that is a perfectly fair point to make <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord lord underhill reads <e>", "<cs> this is consequential on the government decision which we have been discussing to <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord has a point <e> <s> i think we would want to think about this one so we will gladly do that <e>", "<cs> the essential factor in determining what publicity should be given to modification to orders is the nature of the modification itself <e> <s> a modification to upgrade a path may adversely affect a landowner but not anyone else <e> <s> a modification to downgrade a path may leave the landowner unaffected but may be of great concern to path users <e> <s> in other words different modifications may affect different kinds of people <e> <s> to ensure that everybody is informed of every modification would be unnecessarily wasteful of scarce resources <e> <s> the authority should therefore be given the discretion to notify those they consider may be adversely affected <e> <s> i feel that i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i certainly cannot say that i shall be able to do anything about this except of course to say that we shall read what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> that is as far as i can go now <e>", "<cs> i would come back to the point which i made previously namely that the degree of publicity required is dependent upon what is proposed <e> <s> whether it involves downgrading or upgrading should be the determining factor in deciding the degree of publicity <e> <s> i think that it is for the authorities to have a discretion to apply whatever publicity they feel is necessary in the prevailing circumstances <e>", "<cs> again it depends on the situation and the circumstances <e> <s> i think subject to checking that what the noble lord lord avebury said about the hypothetical situation that he put forward is probably right but one would need to check <e> <s> i still do not think <e>", "<cs> i cannot accept the final argument of the noble viscount lord hanworth <e> <s> with the change in procedures given the fact that the requirements for deciding these matters which have pertained hitherto will not apply in the future and given that the circumstances will be quite different that argument does not have any credence <e> <s> but i wish at the outset to give the noble lord lord fletcher an assurance that reviews which have reached an advanced stage will be allowed to proceed to completion <e> <s> that is important and i am glad to be able to tell him that immediately <e> <s> i have a substantial speech which i could make on the subject but i would prefer to consider what lord fletcher said some of the points he made were very relevant and i should like to think further about them <e> <s> in those circumstances he might feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i acknowledge that regulations of this kind ensure uniformity over the country as a whole <e> <s> indeed at one time we took the view that there was much to be said for them and a proposal to this effect was in fact included in our consultation paper <e> <s> however on reflection it seemed to us to be inconsistent to be transferring jurisdiction on definitive maps to local authorities on the one hand while tying their hands very firmly on a comparatively minor issue on the other <e> <s> i say this although i am aware that the final decision on the question of the transfer of jurisdiction has yet to be resolved <e>", "<cs> the clause that we are now debating provides not only for the preservation of those green-lanes which are regarded as specially valuable as did the noble lord lord aveburys other new clause on ancient unmetalled highways but also for the extinguishment of any right of way over them for vehicles except for the limited exemption under subsection <e>", "<cs> i would assume that my noble friend would support it <e> <s> i wonder whether i might assume that we are while speaking to this <e>", "<cs> i wondered also whether the noble baroness might feel that we were also dealing with amendments nos <e> <s> a a and zb <e>", "<cs> that is fair enough <e> <s> we have accepted that the evidential provisions applicable to footpaths and bridleways should be subject to a proviso regarding possible higher rights <e> <s> i shall be speaking shortly on an almost identical amendment that has been tabled <e> <s> as for the remainder of these amendments they would appear to be intended to deal with what i respectfully suggest is a non-existent problem <e> <s> the map and statement to be prepared under clause would become the definitive map and statement on being modified <e> <s> since the evidential provisions would apply to all definitive maps and statements whatever their origin i would submit that the need for a specific provision along the lines of the amendment disappears <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend would feel able to agree with that and therefore would not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord fletcher quite properly anticipated the tenor of what i would say in reply namely that the amendment is not necessary <e> <s> i appreciate that his motives in tabling this amendment are to clarify what may not be altogether obvious to some people <e> <s> but clause is unambiguous in the fact that the conclusive evidential effect of the definitive map and statement applies only to the particulars contained in the map and statement and nothing else <e> <s> if a footpath or any other category of public right of way for that matter has not been afforded definitive map recognition this lack of recognition because the map and statement is conclusive evidence only of what is shown cannot and never has been taken to mean that the right of way does not in fact exist <e> <s> there is not much more that i can say <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept what i have said and will not wish to press on with the amendment <e> <s> i ought to say too that the rights of way provisions in this bill will not apply to scotland <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his remarks <e> <s> i gladly look for any source of help in expediting the proceedings <e> <s> i look almost with desperation at times because of the time we are taking <e> <s> however i do not seek to belittle the importance of everyone saying as they will in any case exactly what they wish to say <e> <s> i hope that they in turn will feel for me for my noble friend lord avon and for the others working on the bill <e>", "<cs> i am quite content with that <e>", "<cs> my noble friends question only highlights the extent of the difficulties with which the government are faced in this bill in trying properly to look after the interests of everyone concerned <e> <s> my noble friend has raised a point which i am sure by itself is fair enough <e> <s> however the position has been like that for as long as i know <e> <s> therefore i would answer him by turning the question back and asking what does he do now <e>", "<cs> when we come to it i am sure that we shall be glad to tackle it <e>", "<cs> your lordships will be aware that under subsection of clause the surveying authority will be required to keep a copy of the definitive map and statement available for inspection in one or more places in each district and as far as practicable in each <e>", "<cs> the noble lord makes the point well enough <e> <s> i think it is interesting <e> <s> certainly we ought to think about it as to the best way in which we might do something to try to cover the point <e> <s> i will take it away and think about the best way we might do it <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene for a moment a government amendment has been tabled to this effect <e> <s> i suspect that is why the noble lord lord melchett did not move it <e> <s> it may be that that will help the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the point here is that we recognised the need for the improvement of the right of way provisions and it is to that end that we have tabled the amendments <e>", "<cs> former county borough areas are now integral parts of the counties to which they belong <e> <s> they frequently contain substantial areas of countryside in which one would expect to find a number of <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend i am interested in anything that will help good management but i think the proposed new clause embraces in addition to public paths and metalled tracks other classes of highway and as such surely it is a matter of general highway legislation and the government really would not want to agree to extend this bill to incorporate them <e> <s> therefore i wonder whether on reflection my noble friend would not agree with me as regards this matter and perhaps agree to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> the idea that my noble friend has put forward is not objectionable in principle but since the clause encompasses all classes of highway and not just rights of way or other unmetalled highways i respectfully submit that it is outside the scope of the bill <e> <s> indeed as with the previous new clause which my noble friend moved as an amendment this proposal although it is concerned with the town and country planning act is again a matter of general highway legislation <e> <s> again for that reason the government would not want to agree that it would be right to extend the bill to incorporate the amendment and again as i said last time in view of that perhaps my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we feel in this instance that days is more than adequate for interested persons to obtain details of a particular proposal to consider the merits <e>", "<cs> i recognise that in many respects the present provisions for the creation diversion and extinguishment of public paths may be in need of improvement and that there may be a need for local authorities to initiate diversion orders <e> <s> i respectfully submit that what is needed in the circumstances is not piecemeal changes but a comprehensive review of the legislation <e> <s> while obviously i cannot make any promises since it is independent of government i hope that this is something that michael spicers rights of way committee may be able to take under its wing and i give an assurance that i shall take steps to explore this possibility <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend and others would agree that in the absence of such a review it would be wrong to change the present legislation <e> <s> perhaps with the assurance that we shall look at the matter very seriously in the way that i have suggested my noble friend may feel able to withdraw his amendments <e>", "<cs> i think that that is absolutely fair comment <e> <s> it is certainly not in any attempt to fob off someone get out of something or move away from it that i say what i do say <e> <s> we are glad that there is a body sitting in this way <e> <s> we want to hear what it has to say and to be advised by it in so far as we think that proper <e> <s> i make careful note of the point about timing to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> let me confess at once that on the subject of hop wilt or any other associated or like disease i am no expert <e> <s> i would have thought that the answer to my noble friends concern on this matter is surely that under the highway act there are already powers for farmers to ask for diversions of this kind if they so wish <e> <s> i would have thought that in fact that was the solution to his concern <e>", "<cs> i have indicated on two occasions previously that changes to the present public path order procedure should flow from a comprehensive review of the legislation <e> <s> on this occasion however i must respectfully question the merit of the main amendment <e> <s> i recognise that it is intended to meet a specific problem but because it would enable an order-making authority to disregard certain objections it would amount to a curtailment of a persons democratic right to object to an order and to have that objection considered on its merits <e> <s> of course i feel sure that that is not the intention of my noble friend but i know that he will appreciate that for that reason alone we could not accept it <e>", "<cs> i can only refer to the budgets as such my lords and say that our call for revised budgets led to savings of some million <e> <s> i hope the remaining excess from the million will be substantially or completely eliminated at the out-turn but we shall have to await the actual out-turn figures before we know <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will surely know under the arrangements as they have applied for the year the secretary of state had no powers to be selective in the way that i think my noble friend would like <e> <s> the position for is different now that we have the new act and the secretary of state will be able to be selective <e> <s> indeed the new grant system affords certain opportunities of which i am sure my noble friend is aware <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for each individual authority to answer for the position in its area <e> <s> each authority will decide its spending priorities <e> <s> it is for each authority to decide whether road cleaning should be one of its priorities <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not accept that for one moment nor do i accept that either the conservative party or the government are lambasting local authorities as such <e> <s> we are concerned to ensure that whatever money is spent we get the very best value <e> <s> that has not always been the case nor is it always the case <e> <s> secondly we want to ensure that the amount that we spend is in keeping with what we can afford both as a country as a whole and as individual areas <e>", "<cs> my lords that point is well away from the original question <e> <s> i should dearly love to cross swords with the noble lord on the issue of the rating system as such but this is not the occasion upon which to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should say immediately that when we talk of cuts we usually mean cuts in the rate of growth and expansion but in any case it is for each authority itself to decide what its priorities should be <e> <s> if an authority has to reduce some of its spending i would hope that the reduction would be in an area where it would have the least possible adverse effect on the citizens concerned <e> <s> there are many opportunities with regard to spending if those who are concerned will take them <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what happens when we deviate as far from the question as we seem to be doing <e> <s> i would merely say that in considering what is good value we should try to ensure that in all spending there is a pound-for-pound return <e> <s> if the noble lord has been in local government as long as he says he has he will know better than most people that that rarely happens <e>", "<cs> my lords that point relates to one of the opportunities that every authority should be concerned about <e> <s> local authorities should be looking at the best way of doing things whether through the private sector or in any other way <e> <s> i should have thought that those who are concerned with these matters would be looking at the kind of arrangement that my noble friend suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords the same applies in that until we have actual out-turn figures i am not in a position to say exactly what has transpired in scotland <e> <s> so i am very much in the same position as i was in answering my noble friend as regards england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords at present the secretary of state has powers only to reduce grants to individual authorities whose out-turn is excessive <e> <s> in the bill currently before parliament he is taking powers to make similar reductions where there are excessive and unreasonable budgets <e>", "<cs> my lords what is essential in each separate area is that the individual authority should <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of monitoring reductions in services or indeed increases if it comes to that <e> <s> it is not the function of government to do that <e> <s> it is the function of government to decide what we can afford to spend by way of grant and it is then for each authority itself in the light of its own individual situation to decide which services it can or cannot increase and which services it can or cannot decrease <e>", "<cs> my lords i am answering the question of my noble friend lord monk bretton <e>", "<cs> well my lords i did not know that that question had been called but i hope that your lordships will feel that in any event my responses are most apposite <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we are indeed aware of that very point <e> <s> i am hoping my right honourable friends will be able to ensure that those who are interested in the stansted inquiry will have information as to the decision on the gatwick proposals on their hands <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for saying that in that way <e> <s> it obviously is a matter of much concern <e> <s> on the other hand i think it must be recognised that whereas in this particular instance the inquiry has had to take in so many far-reaching matters of such concern to so many people to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to make his point that is one of the prices that we have to pay in the system that we have <e> <s> nevertheless a quicker outcome of these inquiries would be desirable <e> <s> clearly no one would quarrel with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> when my honourable friend introduced this bill on second reading in another place he said that it was short and in the governments view uncontroversial <e> <s> it is now slightly longer but it remains in our view uncontroversial <e> <s> as a result of the wide-ranging debate in another place a number of amendments were made <e> <s> the government believe these have improved the bill <e> <s> we have it in mind to make a further addition to the bill also i hope noble lords will feel an improvement during its passage through your lordships house <e> <s> i shall say more about that in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not think that was so but as the bill proceeds we will take up the point which the noble lord has made <e> <s> i was saying that this situation cannot be right <e> <s> such loss should really be borne by the community as a whole through the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord gisborough for raising this important subject today and i too very much welcome debate in this area and of course i have listened with interest to the views expressed this evening <e> <s> i must compliment my noble friend on the powerful case he made <e> <s> the savings figures in certain circumstances to which he referred were certainly impressive <e> <s> i must say that most of what he said is not new to me but i suspect it is to many people perhaps not in your lordships house but to many others who might read of it and i think it is good to give the topic the maximum possible airing <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the reason for this amendment <e> <s> our original intention was to bring under planning control only the working of mineral waste and our sole reason for widening clause to cover all mineral working deposits has been the impossibility of distinguishing in legislation terms between waste and a stockpile <e> <s> i do not feel that the amendment provides a satisfactory solution to this problem <e> <s> the test which is proposed the intention at the time of deposit would introduce a great deal of uncertainty and we are afraid that this would be difficult to resolve without the return to the secretary of state on appeal <e> <s> i still feel that the solution we are proposing to this problem a wide definition in the bill and granting planning permission in the gdo for cases where planning control is clearly inappropriate is the most practical way forward <e> <s> that is why i am unable to accept my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not repeat today all of the arguments that i advanced in committee about what we are doing to ensure that adequate provision is being made for the long-term needs of the mining industry <e> <s> let me just say that i have not forgotten the promise which i made to my noble friend lord mottistone in response to his committee amendment no <e> <s> at that time on long-term planning <e> <s> i said that i would consider whether a provision more narrowly drawn than that amendment would be a useful addition to the bill <e> <s> unfortunately it is not easy to see how such a provision might be added without having unfortunate repercussions elsewhere in the planning system <e> <s> but we have not given up hope and it may be possible to introduce something appropriate in the other place if not in your lordships house <e> <s> even if we conclude that it is not appropriate for this bill i should like to give an assurance to my noble friend that we shall be advising mineral planning authorities when the bill comes into effect that they must ensure adequate provision for the needs of the mining industry <e>", "<cs> i shall of course consider carefully what the noble baroness said my lords and just as she is anxious that it should be right we are equally anxious <e>", "<cs> my lords i too will with permission speak to this amendment and the others to which the noble baroness lady birk referred <e> <s> since this matter was discussed in committee we have given much <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i would say that i am always glad to give an assurance of consultation since as i have said so many times in the house it is only through maximum consultation that we can produce the best bills <e> <s> i readily undertake to do that <e> <s> with regard to the point made by my noble friend lord gisborough i would agree that much of the work is done by those who carry out the structure plans but if one considers the country as a whole rather than a single area one sees that the need is very great <e> <s> without question the survey will bring out this point and that is why it is certainly worth undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness rightly says i wrote to her to explain why although we fully intend to make an amendment on these lines it has not yet been possible to come up with a suitable form of words <e> <s> i gladly assure the house that it is my intention to bring forward such an amendment on third reading and of course an equivalent one to the scottish part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i resisted a very similar amendment at committee stage and i regret that i must do so again <e> <s> we accept that it may well be sensible to consult the landowner and indeed the operator as an after-care condition <e> <s> but there are other cases outside the mineral field where such consultation is equally sensible but it is never actually <e>", "<cs> my lords when i was talking about planning legislation in general it covers such a great field that i would not be in a position to say that there were no situations at all <e> <s> i take the point my noble friend is making and i am sure it is a valid one <e> <s> i still feel we do not want this to be the first time where we put something like this into legislation <e> <s> in view of what my noble friend has said we will have a look at this point and if there is something arising from it that gives cause for concern we will look at that <e> <s> i cannot go further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have considered carefully my noble friends proposal to extend the certification procedure to restoration conditions as well as to aftercare ones but on balance i do not think this is necessary nor do i think it right to impose this additional duty on mineral planning authorities <e> <s> the certification procedure has been introduced for after-care because there may be genuine uncertainty as to whether the condition has been complied with during the five-year period and it is to the benefit of all that the mineral planning authority should state whether or not it is satisfied <e> <s> a restoration condition as defined in this clause is much narrower in that it merely refers to the use of topsoil subsoil or soil-making material <e> <s> it seems to me that there is much less doubt as to whether or not this has been done to the satisfaction of the mineral planning authority and although of course the mineral planning authority has complete discretion to certify that the restoration condition has been complied with it if wishes to do so i must resist this amendment which would make it a statutory duty <e> <s> i hope that with this explanation my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as amendment no <e> <s> is concerned i fear that this is defective in that by removing the words that my noble friend proposes the following reference to that person in line is made meaningless <e> <s> there is not much that i can add to what i said before <e> <s> i noted my noble friends concern as i said a few moments ago when i moved government amendment no <e> <s> in committee <e> <s> in moving our amendment today to remove the limitation that the contract must have been made between the two parties i had hoped that my noble friend and the house would feel that this meets the point <e> <s> whether or not any other observations that he makes adversely affect this as he often and fairly says that he will read what has been said and consider it i shall do the same but i cannot go beyond that today <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that this amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> under section of the town and country planning act a local planning authority may enter into an agreement with any person interested in land in their area for the purpose of restricting or regulating the development or use of the land either permanently or during such periods as may be prescribed by the agreement <e> <s> mineral working sites will certainly include land and it is of course possible to use such an agreement to cover the future uses mentioned by my noble friend and for it to be used in lieu of an order under some other section of the act <e> <s> i hope that with that explanation my noble friend will be satisfied and feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear i cannot help the noble baroness <e> <s> it is true we were trying to get a balance somewhere and we are still in that same position <e> <s> it seems to me that that is the right thing to do <e> <s> i said in committee that some time limit should be placed on all existing workings so that we are no longer left with mines and quarries with an indeterminate life <e> <s> however i am also very conscious of the industrys long-term planning needs as i have said on so many occasions during the passage of this bill through your lordships house <e> <s> when operators have received permissions with no time limit upon them in the past they clearly expected to be able to go on working those quarries to the end of their useful life and of course they would have had a right of appeal when permission was granted had too short a life been imposed <e> <s> i do believe that years is too short for some existing mines and quarries and that the time limit of years which was the period recommended by both the stevens committee and this government should be retained <e> <s> therefore i cannot accept the noble baronesss amendment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we do have some doubts about the precise way in which this should be done but we are sympathetic <e> <s> we want to consider this and i gladly give my noble friend the assurance that we will do so if he will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly welcome as i said in committee a streamlined procedure for the coining into operation of suspension orders if that could be done without leaving weaknesses <e> <s> unfortunately we have yet to come up with a satisfactory answer <e> <s> my noble friends amendment today seems to have two main weaknesses <e> <s> first there is no procedure whereby those entitled to be served with notice are actually told that the order has come into effect and clearly it is essential that everyone should know that date <e> <s> secondly there would be no way of knowing whether all those people who are <e>", "<cs> my lords when this matter was raised in committee i did as my noble friend said advise that the amendment was unnecessary <e> <s> we have of course had another careful look at this but with respect to my noble friend we do not think it would be right to put into the bill what would amount to a superfluous reference having in the opinion of my legal advisers no legal effect <e> <s> as i explained in committee section of the act provides that a charge or other matter affecting land shall be a local land charge if it falls within any of the descriptions contained in the section and is not one of the matters set out in section <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i can do nothing to help the noble baroness with the first of these amendments <e> <s> i shall shortly be moving government amendment no <e> <s> which introduces a new consultation requirement as noble lords requested in committee and in addition financial regulations such as these can be made only with the consent of the treasury <e> <s> however i hope it will be of some help to the noble baroness if i say that i am prepared to consider the second of these amendments since i recognise that the contents of the regulations should include the two matters set out in subsection <e> <s> counsel has however advised that the wording of the amendment is unacceptable in its present form <e> <s> i hope that with that assurance the noble baroness will be willing to withdraw her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment brings us once again to the subject of the compensation regulations <e> <s> my noble friend lord mansfield said in committee on th february that he hoped it would be possible for a statement on the content of the regulations to be made today <e> <s> your lordships will appreciate that discussion of the consultation paper which we issued last autumn is still continuing and indeed officials in my department have met representatives of the cbi and of mineral planning authorities within the last two weeks to consider the matter further <e> <s> however i hope it will be for the convenience of the house if briefly i set out our current thinking and its likely implications <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend would give way for a moment before he sits down i am anxious to get on the record that i recognise that this is a fundamental issue and that some concern about it still exists <e> <s> if as i hope my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment i intend to ask the officials to make an attempt to refine our formula so as to meet the industrys criteria while providing threshold levels which will enable the bill to operate in the way that we intend and we will discuss the results with both sides in the hope that a measure of agreement can be reached before the regulations come to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not consider it to be an anomaly <e> <s> indeed with respect i am not sure i am altogether following the point my noble friend is making <e> <s> perhaps he would like to put it forward again <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is so <e> <s> i did not say it would be the first time the owner would be consulted <e> <s> the fact is that owners of land are notified of planning applications and hence that was the reason why they would not be consulted in that sense <e> <s> it is a question of what you mean by consultation <e> <s> if you are notified that an application has been made you then know what is happening and you are in a position if you wish to do so to take steps to do something about it <e> <s> i think that is the difference <e>", "<cs> my lords for the convenience of the house i shall speak also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> one consequence of my noble friends amendment would be that the forestry commission would be consulted on trees grown for shelter or amenity as well as those planted for commercial forestry <e> <s> i understand that the commission do not want to take this on nor indeed do i see any need for them to do so <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will feel that with the extension of clause to cover making land suitable for sustaining trees shrubs and plants the substance of his amendment has already been met <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to cover some of the points made by my noble friend lady elliot and the noble baroness lady birk but perhaps they will allow me to begin with a reference because it is the shortest point made that requires comment to the noble lord lord greenwood <e> <s> yes i entirely take his point <e> <s> i would only say that if my honourable friend in another place did misunderstand the amas position then i am very grateful to the noble lord lord greenwood for setting the record straight <e> <s> as he says it is certainly a possibility <e> <s> of course i am grateful for the support of the ama for at least the principle of the fees and their approval is indeed another matter <e> <s> so far as i am concerned i think i am pretty clear as to exactly where they stand in the matter but it is good that we should get the record straight and i gladly thank the noble lord for that <e>", "<cs> no i do not agree my lords and if the noble baroness will allow me when i come to her points i shall try to develop the reasons why <e> <s> as to the charge on agriculture which is a very important matter of concern to many i know i would say that most agricultural developments will in fact be exempt from charges by virtue of the gdo permission <e> <s> those developments for which a planning application is necessary will usually first be very large over square metres in which case the charge will be marginal to the cost of what must be a very expensive and sub-stantial development or secondly will give rise to difficult planning issues for example those relating to intensive livestock units or thirdly will be unconnected with farming activities on the land <e> <s> in all these circumstances it seems reasonable to make a charge but i undertake to consider any difficulties which may arise in practice and to take them into account in any review of this scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords we will await the planning fees but the fact is that when the noble baroness talks about these proposals encouraging people to avoid planning permission i am fully entitled to quote the fact that the extension of the gdo is a fundamental part of a total package and that what we are proposing is the whole of the planning scheme <e> <s> it was so argued in the act as i am sure she well remembers <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord mansfield i beg to move that the draft regulations laid before the house on nd march be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that it was far far too soon after some two months to come to a conclusion <e> <s> the figures fluctuate on a month-by-month basis as i know the noble lord knows <e> <s> we shall have to wait a little longer to see what are the real implications <e> <s> then perhaps we might have a better picture than we have now <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has raised a very important point which i readily acknowledge <e> <s> i would only refer to the circular itself <e> <s> in the guidance which we give we say <e>", "<cs> my lords speed is certainly of the essence but in my experience it is not likely that local people will make a decision against their local knowledge and their local aspirations as to aesthetics as well as to the other aspects we are discussing <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not agree with that at all <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend has made the position quite clear <e> <s> it is for the county authority to decide upon the structure plan <e> <s> it then comes forward for consideration by the secretary of state <e> <s> he then makes such modifications as he thinks ought to apply <e> <s> it is then open to people to object to those modifications if they wish to do so and it then comes back to the secretary of state for him to consider those objections <e> <s> the current position with regard to this particular case is that he is now considering the objections which have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords other than by repeating what i said i do not think that i can help the noble lord any further but i note what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness and to my noble friends lord mottistone and lord gisborough <e> <s> on the question of how one should interpret the word reasonably i see that the noble lord lord mishcon is smiling <e> <s> he perhaps more than most of us must have spent many years of his life in the courts trying to interpret that very word <e> <s> in the end it will depend upon what the people concerned feel is reasonable when the circumstances are applied to a situation which may arise <e> <s> i hope that the insertion of this word does not cause difficulty in any way <e> <s> the concern of the noble baroness is that it may leave room for argument upon which somebody will have to decide at the end of the day <e> <s> i appreciate that <e> <s> at the same time in turn i hope that she will appreciate that throughout the whole of this bill we have been trying to steer a middle course and to get the best we could for all concerned <e> <s> it is in that context that i would ask her whether we might leave it at that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that i specifically covered that in what i said <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> in fact is equivalent to amendments nos <e> <s> and together that is why i did not speak on it <e> <s> am i right in thinking that it is that one to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just make sure that we are talking about the same thing <e> <s> this also comes under amendment no <e> <s> and it is referred to later on in the one that i omitted to mention <e> <s> i understand the noble lord to be asking about the words during such period as may be specified for each step <e> <s> in fact the words in amendment no <e> <s> are deleted and replaced in amendment no <e> <s> but in the drafting in this way we have made so many reshufflings indeed the first clauses were completely recast that it is a little confusing but i hope the noble lord will find it there in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that my noble friend has it right and i do not want to go into the detail of it <e> <s> i think that is probably where it originates <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon was concerned as to why it was there at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> i think this bill has provided an excellent example of just what a good job this house can do in giving due attention to the detailed drafting of bills <e> <s> we have had a number of interesting and wide-ranging debates on the bill and i would be the first to recognise that it has been substantially improved by the amendments which have been made many of them at the suggestion of your lordships <e> <s> i am particularly glad that we have been able to incorporate a number of new points for example on pipelines and on the limitation of enforcement action to mineral planning authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that our citizens are free to come and go as they please without reference to government <e> <s> but in any case it is impracticable because there is no requirement for such individuals to notify the government of their intentions to travel to south africa or anywhere else come to that <e>", "<cs> my lords if she so wishes the prime minister will make such statements as she thinks are appropriate in this matter as indeed in any other matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i note carefully what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> not at all my lords there have been such things said not very frequently but sometimes <e>", "<cs> no my lords any comment that i would make on that would not be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that is something that the noble lord lord avebury himself would have to take up if he so wished <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord melchett indicated these amendments are similar to those tabled in committee by the noble lady lady kinloss in as much as they would ensure that changes <e>", "<cs> my lords with h leave perhaps i will now give the detail that i was trying to avoid having to do before in that the noble lord lord fletcher felt that my response was less than satiafactory <e> <s> the fact is that clause states categorically that authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will allow me to speak again i think you can take this argument all ways <e> <s> you can say that this will do no harm but my advice is that it is not necessary <e> <s> but the one point that i make and i have said this on all the bills i have dealt with is that we want the best and clearest bill we can get <e> <s> if it is felt that there may be a difficulty of the kind referred to and it is felt that it is not clear i will undertake to take the point back and look at it and discuss it again with the legal advisers <e> <s> should the situation be as the noble lord has said we will have no hesitation in making a change <e> <s> however i think at this moment that i would be no more justified in accepting that what the noble lord has said is right so far as his legal advice is concerned than i would be in turning down the advice by my legal advisers <e> <s> but i accept there may be a point and we will look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first place the amendment would prevent the upgrading of a road used as a public path to a byway open to all traffic <e> <s> i must confess to not understanding why the amendment should deal with rupps in the context of clause when clause provides for their re-classification <e> <s> be that as it may i cannot accept the desirability of preventing upgrading to a byway if the evidence supports it <e> <s> the amendment then requires that evidence of downgrading should put the matter beyond reasonable doubt <e> <s> i find the application of the onus of proof appropriate to criminal matters curious and unsatisfactory <e> <s> i cannot see why if there is substantial evidence to support a proposal the ordinary civil test which requires that the evidence should put the matter beyond reasonable doubt should not prevail <e> <s> i think it would be wrong not to act if such evidence were available <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i find this group of amendments taken together somewhat puzzling <e> <s> the first no <e> <s> sca if i have it right seeks to give a local authority the discretion whether to upgrade to a byway open to all traffic a rupp which has been downgraded to a footpath or bridleway <e> <s> in saying this i am assuming that the omission of the manuscript amendment changing the word cause to require which was tabled in committee by my noble friend lord monk bretton is an error <e> <s> as i mentioned in committee local authorities already have this discretion <e> <s> the difference between my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments and the issues which they raise are extremely complex <e> <s> i make no apologies for assuming when they came up in committee that they were concerned to curtail the operation of the law on the presumed dedication of rights of way <e> <s> i believe i am now correct in saying that my noble friend is concerned primarily to clarify the situation regarding the relationship between the conclusive evidential effect of the definitive map and statement and the presumed dedication of rights of way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that he would have the right to appeal but clearly that is something that one would want to check and confirm <e>", "<cs> my lords i indicated i think in response to amendment no <e> <s> sc that i regard the reclassification of roads used as public paths within the context of clause as somewhat illogical and perhaps the most sensible and practical arrangement is to keep proposals resulting from the reclassification exercise apart from proposals arising from the normal day-to-day review of definitive maps <e> <s> for that reason i am afraid that i cannot support the proposal <e> <s> the point raised by my noble friend confirms that there is some blurring in this area if i may put it that way and what we are trying to do in the bill is to get as much clarifica <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as i am aware it does not come within the bill and i certainly have not the faintest idea what a drove road is <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply by leave of the house certainly one would want to have a look <e> <s> i know of no specific reason why they were omitted but there would be no difficulty unless there were <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that there are two basic questions which arise in this matter <e> <s> the first is are local authorities the appropriate level of government to take decisions on such matters and secondly if so are they capable of discharging that responsibility fairly and efficiently <e> <s> we had a long debate on these questions in committee and i do not propose to rehearse the same arguments at length again <e> <s> but let us for a moment consider what we are talking about <e> <s> we are talking about two things first definitive maps of public rights of way and secondly public path orders <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords are looking for giant strides <e> <s> i cannot make comment on what has been said other than to say that we shall have a look at it <e> <s> the amendment is presented in order to meet the points that were raised <e> <s> if it transpires that there would be no difficulty in going the extra distance if i may put it that way that is asked for then we shall look at that <e> <s> i know that your lordships will not expect me to say any more on this point at the moment <e> <s> on the other point concerning the amendment that is yet to come had we been able to accept that amendment then i should have let the matter go but for reasons that we shall explain when we come to it we do not feel able to do so <e> <s> that is why i say what i do say about this matter as it is <e>", "<cs> i shall do that my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the noble lords concern over this issue since paragraph of schedule read in isolation appears to allow a local authority to modify an unopposed order at will and thereby unfairly prejudice someones interest <e> <s> but looking at it carefully i am satisfied and i think the noble lord will also be satisfied that this is not the case <e> <s> if the noble lord will turn his attention to paragraph he will see that notwithstanding what is said in paragraph there are restrictions on an authoritys power to make orders with modifications <e> <s> these restrictions prevent an authority from modifying an order with the result that land not affected by the draft order is affected they prevent an authority from showing any way not shown on the draft order or <e>", "<cs> my lords it was paragraph <e> <s> the only modifications which an authority could make without publicity therefore are very minor ones about which they could reasonably expect no one to be concerned <e> <s> i trust that in the light of that explanation the noble lord will agree with me and feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help the noble lord on that at this stage <e> <s> i trust the noble lord lord avebury will see that the points i was making are valid in themselves regardless of the other points which he raised i will come back to those and give him some details of amendments so minor that it could be expected that no one would be concerned about them <e> <s> i hope he agrees that the points made as to paragraph are valid <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to mention one point <e> <s> would the noble lord not feel that while there may be merit in the points he makes the fact is that the authority is prevented from changing the description of a way shown without first publicising it <e> <s> does the fact that there must be publicity which will give the people the opportunity to object and set the machinery of inquiry in motion not cover the situation he describes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that was subject to paragraph <e> <s> the noble lord quoted paragraph <e> <s> i promise not to interrupt again <e>", "<cs> my lords i said in response to the identical amendment moved in committee by the noble baroness lady david that i thought authorities should have the discretion to apply whatever publicity they considered suited the particular circumstances <e> <s> i was certainly willing to have another look at this matter <e> <s> i have done so <e> <s> i fear however that i still do not believe that authorities in the exercise of this discretion would act in any way that would be detrimental to the interests of landowners farmers or the users of rights of way <e> <s> if modifications are likely to adversely affect the interests of landowners i am confident that they will be notified accordingly <e> <s> likewise i would expect users to be notified whenever their interests are affected <e> <s> all this would be in addition to publicity in the local press and notification to the original objectors to the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to accept these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that there is no apparent reason for differentiating between definitive map orders and public path orders as regards the commencement of the six-week period and the question of validity of the orders in the courts <e> <s> i am pleased to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am somewhat surprised in view of your lordships acceptance of the governments proposals for dealing with objections and representations to proposals that would lapse on the abandonment of outstanding surveys and reviews that it has been felt necessary to go further with this amendment <e> <s> since the noble lord lord melchett has chosen to do so i obviously cannot avoid drawing to your lordships attention the inadequacies and the serious implications which it would have for the introduction of the new review procedure within those counties and former county borough areas with reviews and surveys outstanding <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would give way <e> <s> in the light of the decision on the transfer of jurisdiction that we resolved before the break i ought to say straight away that we shall want to look again at this point <e>", "<cs> my lords exactly how far along those several paths to which the noble lord pointed i can go i am not at the moment absolutely certain <e> <s> the point i was trying to make in an attempt to save the noble lord going into a lot of detail was that the decision which has been made clearly alters the stance that otherwise i should have taken <e> <s> obviously i need to consider and to discuss the proper way to deal with the matter before the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the point that the noble viscount lord hanworth made i did say in committee that i did not believe that it should be mandatory for authorities to place copies of the definitive map on sale to the public <e> <s> nevertheless i was and am prepared as i indicated in a letter to the noble lord lord melchett last week to suggest to authorities that copies should be available for purchase <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i say at once that i accept that unlike my noble friends previous amendment which we had in committee this latest one concerns only a limited range of highways <e> <s> the problem is that it nevertheless still represents a departure from the general tenor of the bill in that it amends a provision which embraces all classes of highway apart from trunk and special roads <e> <s> the criticism that it is more akin to general highways legislation is therefore if not to quite the same extent as previously still a fair one to make <e> <s> furthermore it is particularly unsatisfactory in so far as it would create an undesirable anomaly between england and wales since the power of veto enjoyed by the welsh community councils would not be lost <e>", "<cs> my lords as indeed it is consequential of course i do withdraw it now <e>", "<cs> that may be an interesting point to consider my lords but we should have to look at the procedure that exists at present in the water industry at what it was the government did to try if you like to persuade the industry themselves because it was they who called in the outside people and the effect that that had <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be spread over the whole of the country <e> <s> it will of course vary according to each separate authority <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government do not propose at this stage to increase the number of districts and london boroughs which are currently designated for registers but it is expected that the scheme will be extended later in the light of experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that one of the objects of the legislation is to ensure that the mausoleums to which my noble friend refers are opened up and air is allowed in so that one can see exactly what is available <e> <s> with regard to the first part of his supplementary question the scheme is in its relatively early days <e> <s> indeed the registers are not to be published until april and so we want to see what experience is gained after the scheme comes into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may deal with the points raised by the noble baroness lady birk some of those were touched on by the noble lord lord evans and i will try to deal with them together <e> <s> as regards her concern as to where the money goes she was anxious about the money going to the bondholders i thought the noble lord lord evans made a very fair point on that i think it is right that they should be repaid <e> <s> perhaps more important as a matter of principle is the fact that the capital receipts from the sale of the surplus mdhc land to the development corporation flow to the mdhc bondholders and this in fact would have happened in any case because as i understand it under the terms of the bond to whomsoever the land was sold <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i know that but the fact is and my advice is that this point is not directly relevant to the setting up of the mdc because the proceeds from the sale would have to go to the bondholders <e> <s> the fact is that financial support for the port is being considered in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble baroness says as to that <e> <s> the structure of the board seems to have caused some concern <e> <s> i would have thought that what is most needed on this or on any other board of this kind is the right and best people to do the job <e> <s> while we have said that we want to have as much representation as we can and indeed we will try to ensure that and there will shortly be some further consultations with the local authorities i hope your lordships will agree that at the end of the day the fact that it is somebody who is a member of the council now but may not be after may is secondary to the contribution which he or she can make to making this whole enterprise a success because that is what it is really all about <e> <s> i think the days of people being appointed because they represent one body or another have to take second place to their being appointed because of the innate abilities that they may have <e> <s> until we come to that kind of thinking generally we will not succeed in having other than bodies which may become as the noble lord said otiose and all the <e>", "<cs> my lords we said in the manifesto that it was not the intention to make shorthold provisions retrospective and i fear that we have to stay with that <e> <s> i have great sympathy with the problem that my noble friend raises but i see no way in which we can go back on that commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his helpful comment <e> <s> i know of the situation to which he refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the snags to which the noble viscount refers <e> <s> possibly the greatest concern of those who are contemplating making this kind of accommodation available is the fact that the labour party have said that they will do away with this form of tenancy <e> <s> this is understandably a matter of concern for those who would make such accommodation available <e> <s> it is very sad because it only denies rented accommodation to such people <e> <s> having said that i think that there is also the whole matter of the fair rent regulations and laws that exist at the present time <e> <s> it is a matter which is of much concern because if we do not make this kind of accommodation available what will happen to the future of the private rented sector <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend would like to see a booklet which my department has just produced entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords the publication refers to empty dwellings in the ownership of local authorities <e> <s> should there be any aspect which applies to the dwellings to which the noble lord refers then of course we shall look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble baroness requires no reminding of the situation which pertained under the previous administration <e> <s> in answer to her question perhaps it should also be said that if certain authorities had not so enthusiastically embarked upon municipalisation the problems that they have of dealing with great numbers of empty dwellings would not be so great as they are <e> <s> the application of the resources of an authority to housing as indeed to any other service is for the authority itself to decide <e> <s> i would only remind the noble baroness though i am sure she needs no reminding that those authorities which will be selling council houses will have an additional source of income which they can then apply to this or any other aspect of their housing <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the moratorium is concerned that is a quite separate question from the one as to what can be done to help authorities to bring their empty dwellings into repair <e> <s> i say again that the authorities which have the worst of these problems are those which embarked upon so much municipalisation <e> <s> their problems have not suddenly come about because of any moratorium or anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure how far that figure which my noble friend has mentioned was divided between private and public housing <e> <s> therefore i cannot help him by drawing any useful comparison <e> <s> but i note what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of that figure <e> <s> i will gladly ascertain it and write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i said previously this information is currently not collected centrally for scotland and wales <e> <s> i shall have to ascertain exactly what would be involved in obtaining that information <e> <s> if it is practicable i will see what can be done to help my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords this is so far away from the first question that i shall have to ask my noble friend to allow me to discuss it with him privately <e>", "<cs> my lords these are the figures which come in from the housing investment programme returns <e> <s> without a detailed analysis which i do not have before me it is very difficult to answer exactly <e> <s> but i think that the figure of is sufficiently large to cause real concern <e> <s> that is why we have produced the booklet which i hope all those interested will find both constructive and helpful in considering this particular problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i would only say that it is a figure which varies so much from authority to authority <e> <s> in some authorities it is as low as per cent <e> <s> of their housing stock while in other authorities it is as high as per cent <e> <s> of their housing stock <e> <s> that indicates the wide variation which the problem presents <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i dealt with the issues raised by this amendment in my response to the amendment moved in committee <e> <s> i said on that occasion that i did not want to appear unsympathetic to the problems of the farmers and landowners whose interests may have been prejudiced through the inclusion of a way on the definitive map in error <e> <s> however this amendment would curtail the application of the common and statute law regarding the implied or presumed dedication of public rights of passage overland following a long period of uninterrupted use <e>", "<cs> my lords i would just like to say that we shall consider carefully what the noble lord lord melchett has said <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord <e> <s> if anything is to be done it will obviously have to be done in another place <e> <s> however i can tell him that the matter will be considered very carefully <e> <s> i should like to thank him and the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley for welcoming the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady birk asked what the hurry was and she then answered the question herself by saying that it was the glc elections <e> <s> i would respectfully suggest that that is not necessarily the case <e> <s> the fact is that these discussions started about a year ago <e> <s> a formal request was made by the glc under section of the act and i would not have thought that a year or so later we should be talking about a hurry <e> <s> in any case so far as the glc elections are concerned that is not really the point because the secretary of state in fact has powers and could make such an order if he wished regardless of the outcome of the glc elections <e>", "<cs> my lords that was precisely why the glc are retaining the right to make transfers and allocations if you like to the extent that i mentioned previously <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord mishcon that he does not embarrass me in the slightest by the points he raises <e> <s> he knows that i would not have agreed for a moment that this was a retrograde step <e> <s> on the contrary i consider it to be a great step forward <e> <s> i have never found local authorities in the normal way to be unwilling to take on additional responsibilities <e> <s> certainly if that means managing houses within their own geographical borough area then i would normally expect they would only be too pleased to do so <e> <s> the fact that in this instance they are not i suggest reflects the matter of the discussion on terms and conditions <e> <s> if the consultation period to which the noble lord refers has not he feels resulted in the answers that the boroughs may have liked and therefore the government have taken action i respectfully suggest that there is no shortage of precedent for that <e> <s> as to the effect of the bureaucracy on the mobility possibilities that is a matter of opinion <e> <s> i am not worried about the mobility side in view of what we now have and what we are announcing today regarding a national scheme the inter-boroughs scheme plus the right of the glc to go on making nominations to the extent that i mentioned earlier <e> <s> it will be much better than it has been in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may answer the point on the figures first it is correct that it will be million spread over years <e> <s> the funds obviously will come from the glc which will raise their money in the normal way <e> <s> they receive grants in one form or another in the normal way <e> <s> regarding the extent to which this is if you like an impingement on local democracy an erosion of local democracy i would only say that when i look around and see all the things <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the encouragement of the sale of vacant dwellings is concerned authorities have been empowered to sell vacant dwellings in their present condition at discounts of up to per cent <e> <s> and if any of your lordships are interested in knowing more of the details of that information is available in paragraph of the general consent dated st september <e> <s> authorities can apply to the secretary of state under section of the housing act for consent to waive the interest payments on mortgages for up to five years on houses and flats being sold for homesteading and again details of this are set out in paragraphs to of the doe circular / <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that what i had said was rather more than just verbal encouragement <e> <s> if the noble lord will refer to the booklet which i mentioned when answering a similar question earlier this week and which is now in the library i think he will be interested to see set out what the government are doing which is more than simply giving verbal encouragement <e> <s> as to the point on the moratorium i only have to say again that billion of subsidy is given to housing and it is vital that that be not exceeded and all the moratorium seeks to do is to ensure that this is so <e>", "<cs> my lords in very brief terms homesteading refers to accommodation which is vacant and often in very poor condition which people move into and repair themselves <e> <s> the government are anxious to encourage this to be done so as to reduce the number of houses which are vacant and to help those who need accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that all authorities are alert to this kind of situation and that they do indeed look to what they do with the vacant accommodation that they have within their jurisdiction <e>", "<cs> my lords it is still for each authority itself within its own existing situation to look after its own repairs and so long as it does not exceed the sums given to it then of course it can do this kind of work <e> <s> but if we are speaking of supplementing the monies available to an authority to carry out repairs beyond any moratorium or anything else there is <e>", "<cs> my lords this information is not available centrally <e> <s> however i understand from a recent survey conducted by the institute of housing as at st march a great many authorities do now offer their tenants the facility of paying rent by standing order or direct debit although use of such methods within those authorities was generally limited <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend does a great service in bringing this point forward <e> <s> the provisional figure for rent arrears in england at st march is some million <e> <s> therefore this is a matter of considerable national concern <e> <s> the problem is that whereas in a housing association like the very excellent one that my noble friend took me round this is done exclusively and all the tenants pay in this way it is not so easy to be carried forward into either all housing associations or local authorities because so many tenants do not have bank accounts <e> <s> indeed many who might like to pay in this way apart from the question of bank accounts are not able to easily adjust when rents are adjusted <e> <s> there are all kinds of problems <e> <s> so while i applaud very much what the noble baroness is suggesting there are practical problems <e> <s> nevertheless a great number of local authorities now i am told it is well over per cent <e> <s> offer this facility to those tenants who wish to make use of it <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no reason at all why they should not still have a rent book while paying by bankers order <e> <s> the position will vary from auth <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises an interesting point <e> <s> i have not heard of it being a problem in the past <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord says i will have it looked into <e>", "<cs> my lords council rents and rates are in fact paid together <e> <s> therefore the particular problem to which the noble viscount refers is one that pertains rather more to private sector tenants than to local authority tenants where the problem does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness makes a very helpful suggestion <e> <s> i am sure that there are many tenants who can and do pay in that way <e> <s> if more did so then it would to some extent fulfil the same objective as my noble friend lady vickers raises in her question <e>", "<cs> my lords as i say so frequently in answering these questions it is up to an authority itself to decide whether that would be a good thing for it to do <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i shall gladly ensure that what is being done now receives the maximum publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords at the present time there is no intention to designate any further zones <e> <s> we want to see how the existing ones work <e> <s> as i said it is an experiment one in which we have a great deal of confidence and which has been very well received by all concerned <e> <s> we shall have to watch how it goes <e> <s> if it is successful we shall certainly contemplate what more might be done to extend it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to say exactly <e> <s> the first designations will be under way if that is the right term in june and the others will follow in july and august the very last ones will be going ahead by the end of the year <e> <s> then it will be a matter of judgment as to when one decides whether the experiment has gone as it is hoped it will go <e> <s> i cannot give the noble lord an exact time but i know that many people will be watching it with much interest not least the members of my department <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help my noble friend on that because as yet the zones have not in fact come into effect <e> <s> however i can tell her that there has been enormous interest in the areas concerned and it looks very promising indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would not have been so necessary to have had these experiments if the previous administration had done much more than they did <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot of course speak of companies that have gone into liquidation in these zones <e> <s> in fact many of the zones are areas where there is very little activity and cover land which is derelict <e> <s> clearly we are hoping that the enterprise zones will both stimulate existing businesses and bring new ones into existence wherever they may be located <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that our interpretation of what is certainly a far from easy directive is as i have said but perhaps i can return to that point at the end of my remarks because i should like first to reply to some of the other comments which have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever our respective views are about the bill it has given rise to an interesting and in the main constructive debate <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords on all sides will like me he looking forward to the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it amusing that some of my noble friends should smile at that comment <e> <s> i have the same experience when saying similar things to ministerial colleagues who are surprised at the enthusiasm which i like to try to show to working in your lordships house <e> <s> i know that noble lords would like me to deal with as many of the points raised today as possible <e> <s> however it is a wide-ranging bill and this has been a wide-ranging debate so while i shall do my best in the limited time available i hope your lordships will forgive me if i resist the temptation strong though it is to respond to all the issues that were raised and of course it goes without saying that i shall write covering any of the points i do not specifically mention in this winding-up speech <e> <s> some of the provisions are very complex and we shall have a chance to return to points of detail in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords to use an expression that i have learnt since i came into government i would say that i hear what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had said at the beginning and if not i shall gladly take the opportunity to do so now that we are extremely concerned about the appalling number and extent of accidents involving motor-cyclists <e> <s> we are not only carrying out the measures which are outlined in the bill and to which i referred at the time but we will look at everything that has been said today and at anything that may be said in the future about better ways of training to ensure that young people in particular although older ones too if it comes to that who are <e>", "<cs> my lords simply because i do not repeat every point in my response and after all i have spoken at some length does not mean that we will not study very carefully the points made by the noble lady and i an very happy to assure her that they will be considered very thoroughly <e>", "<cs> my lords to deal first with the points raised by the noble baroness lady birk i did know that the original study was set up under the previous administration but it is now this administration which is charged with doing something about the conclusions which it has reached and that is why we are making this statement today <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that was exactly what i had said <e>", "<cs> well that is what i meant to say <e> <s> i thought i was paying tribute to them for having set it up <e>", "<cs> my lords i see from reading the statement again that what was said previously about the setting up of the committee was quite right <e> <s> i was wrong in the first place but i thought that i had put it right when i answered previously <e> <s> however i gladly confirm that fact <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am sorry that is the cost to the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i raised that very point myself when querying the statement that i was to make <e> <s> i am advised that it may be that there will be an improvement on that time but i cannot give any commitment to that extent <e> <s> clearly it is in everybodys interests to do it as quickly as possible and i assure the noble lord and indeed the whole house that the government will not just sit back and let it go <e> <s> we are very anxious that this should be done at the earliest possible moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only add that this obviously has been considered at great length and in great depth <e> <s> our major concern was to get action at the earliest possible time <e> <s> this we feel is the quickest way to get very close to where we want to be <e> <s> the noble baroness and indeed i think the noble lord lord avebury took the other view to go now for the lead-free completely and take according to what the noble baroness has said seven or eight years but i am advised that it will be to years <e> <s> i do not know the answer to that <e> <s> the fact is that we want action as quickly as possible and this is the line that we have taken at present <e>", "<cs> my lords in my view some of the publications are indeed deplorable but the question of whether they exceed the authorities powers is really for the courts to decide <e> <s> with regard to walsall borough council i should have thought with respect that the actions to which my noble friend refers come within the context of the next question that i understand he has down on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that that was the answer that i had given that at the end of the day it is for the courts to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not within the powers of local authorities to spend ratepayers money in a manner which the district auditor may decide is unreasonbable <e> <s> that would be for the district auditor to decide <e> <s> from the mass of correspondence which we in the doe have received from ratepayers incensed by many of these publications i think the noble lord should accept that the answer that i gave in the first place was correct and sums up the position as it is <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not information about which people complain but the political propaganda which is very blatant <e> <s> this government more than any other are determined to ensure that more information of a meaningful kind is given to the ratepayers and to everyone concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords this does not get away from the point that i made a few moments ago that there are certain user of ratepayers money which could be considered to be unreasonable but that is a matter for the district auditor to act upon should he so feel and then for the courts to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords the local government act empowers local authorities to appoint such officers as they think necessary for the proper discharge of their functions <e> <s> they are entitled to choose the criteria by which they make such appointments <e> <s> but an authority which made an appointment solely or chiefly on consideration of the candidates political beliefs might be held to be acting beyond its powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to say that i know of only one case the walsall borough council and this has received general condemnation <e> <s> i hope it is not a precedent <e> <s> we shall have to watch the situation carefully <e> <s> the walsall labour group manifesto which they have now adopted as council policy said <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i understand the point the noble lord is making <e> <s> without going into more details and more quotations which i am tempted to give i can only repeat what i have said before that this is a most dangerous philosophy and one which is giving concern to all political sides in the country <e> <s> i hope that it is the only example that we shall see <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly perhaps i may quote this <e> <s> it comes from what is now the council policy at walsall <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords before i come to the carefully prepared parts of what i plan to say may i try briefly to make a few observations regarding what has been said by noble lords on both sides and not in any special order <e> <s> first may i say to my noble friend lady faithfull that i want to study very carefully what she said about hostels <e> <s> i do not know what are the implications of a joint committee to co-ordinate policy but i would certainly want to talk with colleagues about her suggestion <e> <s> likewise i would want to consider very carefully some of the other points which she has made <e> <s> similarly may i say to my noble friend lady vickers who has for so long been involved with hostels as have so many other noble lords that i do not have the answer as i stand here as to when the order to which she referred will be made <e> <s> in fact i think my noble friend was more concerned as to whether an order will be made <e> <s> i understand that indeed this will be the case but i am sure my noble friend knows that as i stand here i cannot confirm this <e> <s> nevertheless i undertake to write to her on that point and on the other points which she made <e>", "<cs> my lords i gladly undertake to write to the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> when i refer to sales that have taken place my understanding is that they have been completed but i will write and confirm that to her <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must allow me to continue it all comes out as we go along <e> <s> it is a pity that in all this the wish of the noble baroness lady birk was so often taken for the deed <e> <s> how different it must all seem from the other side of the dispatch box <e> <s> the noble baroness will quite rightly accuse me of being highly selective in my quotations and i owe it to her to admit it at once before she finds herself in trouble with her noble friends <e> <s> in context her remarks were often qualified in ways which removed all risk of her earning the conservative seal of approval <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is agreeing with me i thank him for that <e>", "<cs> my lords one is apt to be carried away by discussions of this kind but then this debate is one which concerns people and caring and wanting to do things better so if i am perhaps going on a little about it you will have to make allowances <e> <s> we believe that the private rented sector still has an important role in meeting housing needs particularly those of the young and the single and the mobile <e> <s> that is why in the act we have introduced shorthold which i will quickly mention again in a moment <e> <s> we have given six million public sector tenants the right to take in lodgers and to sub-let <e> <s> we have simplified the rules for new lettings by resident landlords <e> <s> we have extended the circumstances in which those going abroad those in the services and those owning a home to which they intend to retire can regain possession <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord says that with pleasure or with disappointment <e> <s> his party is committed to doing away with it anyhow so that should cause him great pleasure <e> <s> if the figures are as he says i say two things first of all i think the labour party for the reasons i have given must take most responsibility for it and secondly it is still very much too early to come to any conclusions about it <e> <s> but even if it all fails at least it is an attempt to do something as compared to doing nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the blacklist is concerned every country has the right to refuse entry to non-nationals whose presence it would regard as undesirable <e> <s> that right cannot be denied <e> <s> however her majestys government are unable to accept any proposal which would oblige them to place limitations on the freedom of movement of its citizens or interfere with individual liberties <e>", "<cs> no my lords the government will certainly not do that at all <e> <s> i shall not go further than my original answer <e> <s> the fact is that lists of this kind in our view are not helpful and contribute very little to a situation that everyone is sensitively trying to see improved <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i thought i had said that in my original reply <e> <s> i was also referring to the sanroc list that has been published <e> <s> beyond that i entirely endorse the principles expressed by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of health and social security are not allowed access to any drivers records held by the department of transport <e> <s> however my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport does have a statutory obligation under regulation of the road vehicles registration and licensing regulations to supply details of a vehicle and its registered keeper from his departments vehicle records to anyone who can show reasonable cause <e> <s> on the basis of this legal obligation nominated officials in the department of health and social security are allowed to request information from vehicle records for the purpose of investigating possible criminal offences <e> <s> there is no link between the drivers and vehicles records at the driver and vehicle licensing centre <e>", "<cs> my lords what we need to have clear here is that the information that can be requested is not about the driver at all it is only about who is the owner and what is his address <e> <s> no other information is given at all <e> <s> information can be given only about the vehicle itself and its keeper <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be so and the noble and learned lord has the advantage of me in putting it that way <e> <s> if it should be that what we are being asked here in any way implies an intrusion of privacy on the individual then i would respectfully suggest that the answer i gave is the correct one that the giving simply of the name and address of the keeper the owner of the vehicle does not really depart from that basic principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend and would answer yes that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have to come back to my original answer and say that what in fact is being given is the name and address of the owner and nothing beyond that <e> <s> in those circumstances i would not have thought there would be cause for concern <e>", "<cs> my lords if the information requested is of a kind other than that which i have said can be readily given then they would have to show reasonable cause <e> <s> i think that is the safeguard <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his interpretation which may well be right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord is pleased at the answer and i am inclined to agree with him that this would be the feeling of most members of your lordships house <e> <s> with regard to the access point perhaps it would be helpful if i were to say that two of the four ward blocks will shortly be demolished to make way for the new turner museum and the remaining two will be used to provide much needed storage space for the tate gallery <e> <s> other buildings which will be retained as part of the overall redevelopment will be used as offices including a new home for the national art collections fund <e> <s> quite what the effect of that will be on the access i am not too sure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for his obviously very informed response to the point of access and the other matters <e> <s> i do not think anyone would quarrel with any of the observations he has made <e> <s> as to the point about the rest of the site which it is planned to redevelop i would only say that there are plans of which i am sure the noble lord is aware and it is hoped to provide for the future expansion of the tate gallery on this site possibly or should i say hopefully by means of further donations of private funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i unhesitatingly bow to the greater knowledge of the noble lord on this subject <e> <s> i will read with interest what he has said and assure him that we will consider it carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that australian figures are not available <e> <s> we have written to them and we are trying to get as much information as we can from them <e> <s> so far as comparisons with this country are concerned we are unable to draw any comparisons because the legislation came into effect at different times during the s <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the latter point i think we shall have many opportunities in the forthcoming transport bill to debate this not least on an amendment tabled by my noble friend lord nugent of guildford and if i may i should like to hold my fire for that occasion <e> <s> we are not very far from that <e> <s> however i would say again that it is important that we do not draw false conclusions from these figures <e> <s> in fairness we should say that they are interesting so long as we are careful as to how we interpret them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be even more helpful if we were to do as my noble friend suggests if we can get the additional information from the other countries <e> <s> after all these figures relate to two situations only and as i have explained in one of them there is not even a penalty <e> <s> so while i endorse the fact that it would always be helpful to have more analysis i think it would be slightly premature to carry it out merely on the basis of these figures <e> <s> there is one other most important aspect to this it is that there are so many other road safety factors that cause accidents that simply to assume that the wearing of seat belts is the only factor could be extremely misleading <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat i am not anxious to get into a debate in question time <e> <s> i shall have not only many opportunities but many obligations to do so before very long <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raises an interesting point which i have heard talked about elsewhere and i am quite sure that if i again fall back on the need to discuss this at greater length and in greater depth than at question time your lordships will understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i should say at once that i have the same interest in this matter as does my noble friend <e> <s> i am also aware as he is of what the local authority said in their letter to ratepayers <e> <s> in fairness to them it ought to be said that they have come out on the wrong end as they see it of the block grant allocation this year <e> <s> but at the end of the day rates come down to spending <e> <s> that is the issue <e> <s> as to whether or not the powers contained in the local government planning and land act are sufficient to deal directly with the matter in the way my noble friend would wish i have to say that they are not <e> <s> they are powers as to what one does about grant not about what one does regarding putting ceilings or anything of that kind upon the domestic rate <e> <s> to that extent the act does not allow the government to do what my noble friend is seeking <e> <s> i hope however that the grant effects and other measures which the government have taken will bring home to local authorities the fact that impositions of rate increases of this kind do impose intolerable burdens upon individuals <e> <s> this is the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i do not agree because it is not labour controlled <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the lighthearted way in which the noble lord makes the point but in fact it is important <e> <s> as always it is perhaps not right to generalise <e> <s> there are obviously situations where it could be most helpful but there are others where it might not be so helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the second part of my noble friends question i understand exactly that that is the declared intention <e> <s> indeed it was the declared intention before they did so of those who have now taken control of the glc <e> <s> it is also right as my noble friend reminds us and as i hoped i had intimated in my original answer that certainly more than half of the increase in the rate in kensington and chelsea is due to the very high level of the inner london education authoritys spending <e> <s> in fact the consequent loss of grant and the increase in the precept costs ratepayers there p <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not correct <e> <s> in fact the mass and i think that is the proper word to use in this context of large rate increases throughout the country have come from labour-controlled authorities and not from conservative ones <e> <s> there are individual special situations such as the one we are now discussing mostly in london because the emphasis of grant in london which had switched away in previous years to other parts of the country has now been marginally redirected back to london <e> <s> that is the reason why it is mostly the london authorities which have had this problem with grant but i do not accept the first part of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are very alert to that <e> <s> i tried to imply that in my original answer to my noble friend <e> <s> it would i think be proper for me to say with perhaps more emphasis than i did initially because it is no secret that we are looking very closely indeed at exactly what might be done about this whole matter <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will accept from me that these are difficult issues and whatever might or might not be done they must stand the test of time <e> <s> therefore although it is perhaps frustrating in that it seems to take more time i think it is more important that we should try to get it right and that where we can we should be in close consultation with all concerned about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i said and i say again that more than half the increase not just half was due to the precepting authorities <e> <s> quite clearly it would not be right at question time for me to go into the individual figures pertaining to this or for that matter any other authority but if the noble lord would like to have more detailed information and he would care to write to me i shall be glad to give it to him <e>", "<cs> my lords it is hard to give the proportion off hand it is not information that i have available at this moment but i should be glad to write to my noble friend if he so wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the government who put rates up at all it is the local authorities concerned <e> <s> as i said originally what puts rates up is spending and however you fool around with grants and adjust them at the end of the day it is still a matter of how much you spend <e> <s> that is the major factor in deciding what the rate levels will be <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult for me to answer that question and thereby to give an opinion upon that <e> <s> what it is fair for me to say is that the council in question has quite a good record if we compare its spending and its achievement in relation to employees per head of the population and in many other ways <e> <s> its record really is a very good one <e> <s> i think it is proper to say that <e> <s> when we talk of increases we talk of percentages and percentages can be misleading because they are percentages on what <e> <s> where do you start <e> <s> i happen to know that the authority in question is very concerned about this whole matter <e> <s> would that all others were as concerned as it is <e> <s> it is looking very closely at all its spending <e>", "<cs> my lords in accordance with normal practice the government will pay the costs of providing the inspector and his assessors <e> <s> in addition they have agreed in this exceptional case to pay the costs of accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure why my noble friend or the people who have the document to which he refers feel that this is an inaccurate statement <e> <s> so far as i am aware this is a correct statement <e> <s> i am not quite sure that i am following my noble friends point <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i did not make it clear enough in my original answer but i thought i said that in fact we will be meeting the costs of the local authorities in this case <e> <s> it is the normal practice for the authority to pay but in this case the uttlesford district council who are the planning authority asked that the government should pay because of the exceptional circumstances and we felt that that was right <e> <s> so in fact i am agreeing with my noble friend that having regard to all the expense involved and the fact that this is the third time round we should meet these expenses and that is why we are doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords this inquiry is in fact a much more modest inquiry not as far-reaching as were the previous ones <e> <s> we do not feel that in these circumstances we should pay the costs or part of the costs of the objectors <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only the expenses of the uttlesford district council <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking here of a planning inquiry <e> <s> while i defer as always to the <e>", "<cs> well my lords whether or not this is too much or too little or whether it covers all that some would like or not i suppose would at the end of the day have to be a matter of opinion and judgment <e> <s> so far as i am aware what we are proposing to pay is exactly what i said we will pay the cost of providing the inspector and his assessors and in addition the costs of accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this bill is a measure to provide statutory authority for continued financial assistance to the port of london authority and the mersey docks and harbour company <e> <s> it has been made necessary by a rapid and unexpected loss of traffic over the last year or so <e>", "<cs> my lords to cover the point about consultation to which the noble lord lord underhill referred and although i am not absolutely clear on the point i understand that consultation did take place with other ports <e> <s> i do not know the answer to the noble lords point about consultation with the trade unions and i will have to write to him about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand entirely that we are talking about two separate issues <e> <s> there is really no mystery or difficulty about the first category which the noble baroness mentioned <e> <s> so far as i am aware there should be not much difficulty in bringing these forward and i was being my usual cautious self in the way that i put the matter just in case in the event there should be any difficulty with some aspects of it <e> <s> in principle at least i entirely accept what the noble baroness has said <e>", "<cs> my lords to deal with the points made by the noble baroness lady birk she was expressing to quote her alarm and despondency at what is happening to the central and local government relationship <e> <s> i too have long been concerned about that but it is certainly incumbent on local government now to be as responsible as it always was in the past and to work within the framework set down by central government <e> <s> but we are seeing possibly for the first time certainly on the scale that is envisaged in the figures that i have given central governments policies being thwarted by local government if local government is not willing to work within those overall parameters <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for his very helpful remarks and may i also take the opportunity to wish him many happy returns of the day <e> <s> may i say to the noble baroness lady stedman who referred to an antagonistic approach that this is anything but an antagonistic approach <e> <s> if we are seriously concerned with a source which accounts for some to per cent <e> <s> of all public spending as we are and have to be we must surely recognise that in order to get to where we need to be though not to where we necessarily <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend to whom i gladly give the assurance that he called for in his last sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead has made a fair point <e> <s> it is a question of what the level should be <e> <s> i would only say to him that governments have to decide what levels can be afforded in total <e> <s> it is quite true that there are and will always be local situations where a good case can be made but this does not in any way detract from the base of the argument which is what can we afford <e> <s> for very many years we have said we need this therefore we must have it but there comes a point where as a government one has to say we cannot afford it <e> <s> however i take the noble lords point about the need to consult and i assure him that we intend to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely accept that <e> <s> i think that is very fair comment <e> <s> i rather gathered from the way the noble lord put it that perhaps he was <e>", "<cs> let me make one point very clear at the beginning of our discussions on part i of the bill <e> <s> the government and the british railways board have agreed what the policy should be <e> <s> we are clear about the goals for which we are aiming namely to put these businesses into the private sector where <e>", "<cs> if i may deal first with the point raised by the noble lord lord mishcon with great respect i think that this is very much ado not about nothing but about a matter which is really as i tried to say in my opening remarks outside the scope of what we are talking about in this bill <e> <s> the fact is that it is for the railways board to decide on the scope and use of its existing powers <e> <s> the board have decided that they can use section <e>", "<cs> i think it would be fair to say that what the noble lord has read out is indeed what my right honourable friend said in another place but in fact the secretary of states consent is required to the acquisition of the hotels and i think it is also right to say that the proposal is still the subject of informal discussions between the advisers to british transport hotels and the potential investors <e> <s> i do not want to go into the details of the transaction and i am sure the noble lord does not wish me to do so <e>", "<cs> the position is that the consent of the secretary of state is required to the acquisition of the shares and presumably he can give that consent only when the details are known <e> <s> so far as i am aware the details of a transaction are not yet finalised and i am assuming i say this in good faith that it is that which if you like is the <e>", "<cs> subsection <e>", "<cs> may i say at once that i am very grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for the way in which he has very fairly stated the clear difference that exists between us <e> <s> he is right that we could debate this matter i assure him that i have copious notes in front of me and i am sure he has too <e>", "<cs> the policy of the government and the railways board is that in disposing of their non-rail subsidiaries the board should if they wish be able to retain a substantial minority stake in the businesses <e> <s> this recognises the historic links between the railway and these ancillary activities and would enable the board to participate in any future growth of profits and to continue to exercise over the businesses the influence appropriate for a major shareholder <e> <s> in deciding how large a stake to retain the board will <e>", "<cs> all i would like to add if i may is that if we are not concerned that this is a matter of major ideological significance and really i said it was in the same way that i say i believe most of the amendments are in these parts of the bill because there are differences of view of where we want to be i would rest the whole case regarding this amendment as indeed i do regarding most of the other amendments in this part on the basic assumption that we do not want to place unnecessary restrictions on the boards freedom of action <e> <s> the difficulty is to do that in line with wishing to retain the percentage of shareholding but i do not think the two things are incompatible <e> <s> there are many examples in the private sector where things go along hand in hand <e> <s> i would like to rest the case certainly on this amendment on that particular point of the freedom to act <e>", "<cs> this issue was discussed extensively in another place <e> <s> the government explained then at some length why it is necessary for the railways board to relinquish effective control over its subsidiaries if these businesses are to enjoy the full freedoms of the private sector and if their borrowing and investment are no longer to count against the railways boards external financing limit and investment ceiling <e> <s> i have already touched on this issue in the discussions on previous amendments but i shall try to explain the position a little more fully now <e>", "<cs> i tried to explain this on an earlier amendment when we spoke about the per cent <e> <s> we have been at some pains to emphasise the fact that a shareholding of per cent <e> <s> has significance but we have said again and again that as a government we do not want to interfere with the day-to-day management and control of business least of all this business <e> <s> i think that this will arise again in the next few amendments <e> <s> as the noble viscount knows to hold a majority of the shareholding does not by any means necessarily affect day-to-day control <e> <s> indeed if the other shareholdings are widely spread a dominant shareholder can in effect control a company even though he has a minority shaerholding <e> <s> it depends on the facts in each particular case <e> <s> that is almost standard practice <e>", "<cs> i shall be very interested to read in <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord underhill anticipated i say that his fears are unnecessary <e> <s> i can see why the amendment is put down <e> <s> they fear that the powers in clause will open the way for de-nationalisation of parts of the railway itself the amendment attempts to prevent that happening by debarring the board from establishing a subsidiary company to operate part of the rail network <e> <s> the logic is apparently that since the boards disposal powers in this clause apply only to subsidiaries that will block the use of these powers in relation to the railway <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble lord lord underhill will not be surprised to know that the amendment is unacceptable to the government <e> <s> it cuts right across our policy and i therefore assume that this is a probing amendment designed to discover the governments intentions towards sealink <e> <s> our position is simply that we want sealink to be transferred to the private sector as soon as possible for reasons which are well known and which i shall therefore not repeat <e>", "<cs> i cannot answer that question because i do not know the position <e> <s> however i shall be glad to write to the noble lord if that would be helpful <e>", "<cs> first i should like to concentrate on the figures that the noble lord mentioned and which seemed to form the basis of his argument for the amendment <e> <s> i think i should state the following facts <e> <s> there are two points to make on the matter of the figures <e> <s> the first is that the great bulk of the boards net rental income from property is derived from operational property which it should be said at once is only marginally affected by the present policy <e> <s> a limited number of buildings classified as operational but in fact no longer needed for running the railway are to be included under the new policy <e> <s> rental income from operational property was million in million over the last five years whereas income from non-operational property i want to stress this which makes up the great bulk of the portfolio which the government now wish to get into the private sector was million in that year and million over the last five years <e>", "<cs> it is not for me to tell my noble friend lord cockfield how to express himself he has no difficulty in doing that <e> <s> i am sorry if my noble friend lord cockfields remarks did not appeal to the noble lord lord beswick but certainly they appealed to many members of your lordships house <e> <s> as to the point that was made about compulsion to sell under duress when the noble lord lord beswick reads what i said in the <e>", "<cs> it has always been the case that when assets are sold off by public bodies the test should be what is done with the money received <e> <s> by selling one converts a fixed asset into a liquid asset <e> <s> it is how one applies the money that should really be the criterion and the justification for having made the sale in the first place if we are talking purely economics <e> <s> often there exist other factors as well <e> <s> for instance if a local authority sells some land one can certainly decide whether the local authority does with the money that which ought to be done but one could also bring in all sorts of other arguments about what goes on to the land once it is no longer in the local authoritys ownership and so on <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just say simply that i confirm that the british rail property board is not a subsidiary of the company of br <e> <s> it is in fact merely a management division of the board and it does not itself own any of the property which it manages on the boards behalf <e> <s> i fear that in bringing forward the amendment the noble lord lord underhill may have fallen into the trap of assuming that the property board has a separate legal status which i say again it does not in fact possess and if that is not so then there is no problem between us <e> <s> i hope that that clarifies the point raised by the noble viscount lord simon <e>", "<cs> i think we get these things within the bill because we are trying here to point a direction to the board as a whole and the fact that its activities are run by a management company i suppose one could call it that i do not think makes any difference to the policy of disposals <e> <s> it is the main board if you like <e> <s> it is like a company which has a management division within a main board <e> <s> if the management division takes decisions then it does so certainly on behalf of the parent in this case british rail itself <e>", "<cs> my information is that it is the intention of the board to create a subsidiary with which to if you like part with the property and such a company could then presumably be sold <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord beswick feels that i have not then i will look very carefully at <e>", "<cs> from the outset the government have made it clear that in carrying forward their policy they wish to proceed in agreement with the british railways board <e> <s> the agreement reached between the government and the board last summer covered the four businesses referred to in this amendment <e> <s> it is on these four businesses that the board are at present concentrating and where we hope to see early progress <e> <s> if we succeed in achieving the fundamental change in the status of these businesses which both the board and the government regard as necessary that will be a major step forward <e> <s> but it will not exhaust the possibilities <e> <s> i think the board and the government will want to take the policy further <e>", "<cs> there is nothing sinister in the potentially wide application of the powers in clause or of the secretary of states equivalent powers of direction in clause <e> <s> this policy is about the subsidiaries not about the railway <e> <s> moreover the keystone of the governments policy is our desire to proceed in agreement with the board <e> <s> it is the board operating through their holding company british rail investments limited who are taking the lead in making proposals and in carrying them through <e> <s> we expect their proposals to take many forms and we certainly do not want to constrain their opportunities to improve the performance of any part of industry with which their interests involve them <e> <s> this applies in particular to british rail engineering limited <e>", "<cs> well i do not know how one follows that <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will agree with me on at least one aspect namely if the board or any other operation raises money by selling some of its assets it does not have to borrow that amount of money <e> <s> that is a very important point because we must move more and more to the stage where one can do things without always having to borrow <e> <s> when one borrows in the end somewhere down the line it costs you have to pay the cost of borrowing <e> <s> it is not just about the availability of money it is about the cost of that money when you have it <e> <s> i hope that both noble lords will at least be with me on that point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone for tabling these amendments <e> <s> it seems to me that his interests are infinite <e> <s> they stretch to so many matters that i can only wonder in amazement at his great knowledge of such a wide range of subjects <e> <s> but i am grateful to him for tabling these amendments and giving us an opportunity briefly to discuss how sealink will operate when it is in the private sector <e> <s> sealink is at present and will continue to be a companies act company <e> <s> the harbour subsidiary that it is to form will also be a companies act company <e> <s> it will have a board of directors appointed by the shareholders who for the harbour company will be sealink and sealink will include the british railways board and all those who acquire shares when the board dispose of part of their interest <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the set-up will be as described by my noble friend and as at present each harbour will have a harbour manager <e> <s> if it would be helpful i should be glad to give a more detailed written answer to my noble friend <e> <s> i suspect that that would be helpful to him and i gladly undertake to do so <e>", "<cs> once again i do not wish to make a long speech on this clause stand part point and i am glad that i was able to satisfy the noble lord on the point of the splitting up <e> <s> i would only say that in considering the whole future of sealink we have recognised from the outset that the special position of the harbours needed to be taken into account <e> <s> the reason is that in order to operate a harbour in this country it is usually necessary to take statutory powers in a private or local bill and in giving such powers parliament has generally also imposed certain statutory obligations on harbour undertakers in order to ensure that rights of navigation are protected structures affecting navigation are properly maintained and so on <e> <s> sealinks harbours are no exception to <e>", "<cs> of course i understand why the amendment has been put down and the situation which noble lords opposite are trying to avoid <e> <s> i am sure they will not be surprised to hear me say again that i do not think they need fear that the government would use the powers of direction which they are trying to delete from the bill in an irresponsible or sinister way <e> <s> i hope that after the few remarks i want to make they will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is interesting to listen to the discussion and i will only say that if i were called upon to quote precedents of what happened in leeds city council over previous years i should be very happy to trot them out with no difficulty at all but i should have more difficulty in trying to think about what might have been said in your lordships house when as your lordships know i have been here for so short a time <e> <s> so i cannot help either side on that <e> <s> also i am not sure that it would be well to try to think of a series of hypothetical situations which might arise where the power would be needed <e> <s> i can think of one or two but quite clearly it would be better to look closely at that matter <e>", "<cs> i can quickly dispose of the problem that concerns the noble lord on this matter <e> <s> during the transitional period between the appointed day and the setting up of the two-tier organisation the secretary of state will of course appoint the directors of the holding company <e> <s> we have already announced that the intention is to appoint those who are members of btdb as the first directors of the holding company and paragraph of schedule provides that the members of btdb before the appointed day will also be the first directors of associated british ports <e> <s> this will ensure continuity of management during the transitional period and keep disruption to a minimum <e> <s> but after flotation control of the holding company including the power to appoint and dismiss directors must pass to the private sector if the aim of our proposals is to be achieved <e>", "<cs> we consider that it will be in the best interests of the company if the management and workforce are made responsible for their own future <e> <s> we have said that <e> <s> that is why the government do not intend to appoint directors to the holding company either by taking specific powers in legislation or by using their majority shareholding so to do <e> <s> the appointment of directors to the holding company is a matter for the shareholders and by this we mean the private sector shareholders who will control the company and who have a very real financial stake in its success <e> <s> the government accept that they have a responsibility as a prudent shareholder to protect the publics asset <e> <s> we do not think it necessary to appoint directors to control the company to achieve this objective <e> <s> the taxpayers interests should be perfectly well protected by the directors appointed by the private shareholders who control the business and who will pursue its best commercial interests <e> <s> as to the transitional period as i have said the directors will be those who are members of the btdb <e> <s> they will be the first directors of the holding company <e>", "<cs> my information is that in another place this matter of the name was debated for six hours that shows that we are able to make some advance on that <e> <s> i think it may be fair to say that if indeed parliament had discussed it for six hours in that way i must confess to being a little hesitant at reopening the matter though i do know of the concern of the noble viscount lord simon since he has expressed it to me privately <e> <s> i would have to say that the department in fact has received no representation against the name associated british ports since it was adopted <e> <s> i should have thought it unlikely that many people would confuse that with the british ports association <e> <s> indeed i understand that the chairman of bpa welcomed the adoption of the name associated british ports and suggested the new name should prove a satisfactory compromise all round <e> <s> however i have not talked to my colleagues about it i will do so and see what they have to say <e>", "<cs> i must say that if we were to accept this amendment it would prove to be a hindrance rather than a help to our proposals for reasons which i can explain <e> <s> but it may be helpful if i first explain why we propose to take a per cent <e> <s> shareholding in the business when shares are sold to investors <e> <s> it is basically because we want to demonstrate our confidence in the future of the business to all concerned <e>", "<cs> i trust that the noble lord lord underhill will have gathered that my noble friend does not agree with him <e> <s> while endeavouring to be brief i am trying at the same time to give as much explanation as i can and as i think i ought to do on some of these points and not simply to dismiss them even though we do not agree with them <e>", "<cs> in replying i should like to speak also to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the point is taken but i cannot promise my noble friend that he will get a very lengthy answer <e> <s> however i shall do my best <e> <s> the reason that i suggested that we might take the two amendments together was that these powers are both new powers not available to btdb and i thought that it would be helpful if we discussed them at the same time <e> <s> we have heard that ships agents have a long and independent history in which they are called <e>", "<cs> i promise not to touch my noble friend <e> <s> perhaps i can proceed by saying that we have heard that ships agents have a long and independent history in which they are called to act on behalf of shipowners in a wide variety of situations <e> <s> the great number of agents who carry on this business in united kingdom ports are concerned that their work may be seriously at risk if port authorities such as associated british ports are to provide this service themselves <e>", "<cs> may i say first that there is no question of this bill in fact preventing road haulage business continuing to operate into and out of btb harbours <e> <s> several major harbour authorities as i am sure he knows already have power to carry out road haulage <e> <s> these are for example the clyde port authority the tees and hartlepool authority and the medway ports authority <e> <s> i am sure my noble friend knows of this but i thought it might be helpful if i just made the point <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if my noble friend lord mottistone feels it essential that the two amendments should have been taken separately <e> <s> on reflection he is probably right and i apologise to him <e> <s> indeed my noble friend lord lucas would probably say the same applies to me so i gladly apologise to him as well <e>", "<cs> i was going to quote exactly that part of the schedule which was quoted by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> i will not do that but will move on to say that of the section which was quoted it is the latter words which noble lords opposite wish to delete <e> <s> in practice the effect of such deletion would be very little <e> <s> it would not give abp the significantly wider scope which i believe the noble lord lord underhill intended <e> <s> all the amendment would achieve would be to make the powers of associated british ports less clear <e> <s> the deletion of the requirement on abp to dispose of developments would not enable associated british ports to retain new developments for example to run hotels because abp do not have the power to operate hotels <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend and indeed your lordships may find it helpful if i outline very quickly the governments attitude towards recent developments at hull before i come to the amendment itself <e> <s> the government believe that the british transport docks board are in the best position to run their own business effectively <e> <s> no useful objective would be served by the government dictating their commercial policies or intervening in their commercial decisions <e> <s> the possibility of a sale of the fish docks is in our view entirely a matter for commercial negotiation between btdb and any interested purchaser <e> <s> while the department of transport would welcome the retention of a viable fish landing facility at hull the department is not in a position to offer assistance or to ask btdb to act against its commercial interests <e>", "<cs> i welcome the opportunity even at this hour which these amendments provide to explain the governments ports policy and why they have decided to abolish the national ports council <e> <s> the amendment to establish a national ports authority illustrates the basic divergence of views between the government and the opposition on ports policy <e> <s> the opposition genuinely believe that the future success of the industry depends upon the creation of a strong centralised national ports authority as the noble lord lord underhill said with overall responsibility for planning the future development of the ports and for advising on the provision of services and facilities at individual harbours <e>", "<cs> i am deeply grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> his opinion is of great value <e> <s> we shall certainly want to think very carefully about the points which he has made certainly those which i did not cover <e> <s> i know that my right honourable friend will also be very grateful to him for what he has said <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord lord houghton was speaking he managed almost to convince me that i was wrong in wanting to support him too <e> <s> it seemed to me that he was doing fine with the amendment then he nearly but not quite talked me out of it <e> <s> in what i say now i am sure the noble lord will agree with me that we are also talking about amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to say can anyone join in <e> <s> but having listened carefully i do not think that i particularly wish to do so <e> <s> may i say first to the noble lord lord underhill that this amendment is not as he claims different from that of the noble baroness lady stedman in that it would apply only for three years <e> <s> this is already the case by virtue of clause <e> <s> i think we have heard this matter debated at some length <e> <s> i want to say first that it is not the intention under the proposed system that a convicted driver should escape any more lightly than hitherto <e> <s> courts will be able to and should take account of all the circumstances in deciding whether to impose more than the statutory minimum period of disqualification <e> <s> and the fact that a driver might have more than points would of course be a very material factor to take into account <e>", "<cs> the purpose of subsection is to give the secretary of state an element of flexibility so that he can in the light of experience vary without recourse to main legislation the number of points for an offence which is already liable to points <e> <s> lord underhills concern seems to be with the broader question of adding to or deleting from the list of offences which attract points <e>", "<cs> i was speaking to the specific amendment of the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> i shall be very happy if both he and my noble friend lord lucas would like me to deal with amendment no <e> <s> a at the same time <e> <s> i am content to do that <e>", "<cs> i am in the hands of the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> it is his amendment <e>", "<cs> in that case i have dealt with no <e> <s> as best i am able <e>", "<cs> may i say at once that as regards this amendment and the preceding one i accept entirely that noble lords are trying to be helpful and to make this the best bill we can get at this time <e> <s> i accept that without reservation <e> <s> may i also say that as regards this amendment i welcome my noble friends interest in securing the possibility of a wider application of the fixed penalty procedures <e> <s> the possibility of extending them to a wider range of moving traffic offences was examined by the working party as my noble friend knows <e> <s> the report has now been published and i think i would say at once that the government agree that this change should be made <e> <s> however in order to implement it effectively quite extensive legislation will be required <e> <s> it also remains for the government to reach a decision on one important aspect on which views were sought in my right honourable friends foreword to the report namely whether failure to respond to a fixed penalty notice should result in the penalty being recoverable as a fine without the need for a court hearing <e>", "<cs> i am not at all without sympathy on that point but i am advised that in fact it is extensive legislation that would be required to do this <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the reasoning behind this amendment and agree with its intention <e> <s> it does as it happens embody advice similar to that given by the magistrates association on penalties for drinking and driving <e> <s> their leaflet which provides a guide for benches says <e>", "<cs> the argument there was taken up a long time ago in many a moment earlier on and i would not wish to get involved in it now <e> <s> i think i made the point that if it was flexibility one is talking about then one should not be going for rigidity <e>", "<cs> i cannot as i stand here say exactly what is the extent of the information on record but in so far as i am able my noble friend knows that on this as on previous occasions i shall be glad to give him all the information that is available on the matter <e> <s> there is no doubt that the basic problem of drinking and driving is enormous and everybody involved in road safety is deeply concerned about it <e> <s> all we are discussing in the amendment are ways of trying to handle the situation <e> <s> whether the suggestions of my noble friend are better than what is in the bill at present is for him to show <e> <s> but as i have said time and again we want the best bill we can get and i promise to send my noble friend everything that is available and it will then be up to him to decide what to do about it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord houghton knows that lightning never strikes in the same place <e> <s> and what nearly happened earlier on and might have happened i fear he has correctly judged is not about to happen now <e> <s> the fact is that this amendment has brought us to the most controversial and well-debated issue in the drinking and driving legislation <e> <s> those who have proposed that the police should be given an unrestricted power to test at the roadside including the blennerhassett committee itself have usually argued that this does not mean random testing <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> i intervene now on this important and controversial issue in the hope that your lordships will find it helpful to hear the governments view expressed at an early stage in the debate <e> <s> this is undoubtedly an issue that cuts across party boundaries and i confirm that the government are content to follow what is by now well-established tradition and allow a free vote <e> <s> the position of the government is one of neutrality and individual members of the government are free to express their own views as i shall do at the conclusion of what i have to say on this subject <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the house if we now take the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> there is no doubt that motor-cycle conspicuity or the lack of it is a problem <e> <s> i therefore welcome my noble friends initiative in putting down an amendment which gives us an opportunity to discuss this important subject <e> <s> research by the transport and road research laboratory suggested that some per cent <e> <s> of accidents involving motor-cycles also involved another road user though it was unable to impart blame per cent <e> <s> of those accidents occurred at junctions roundabouts or private entrances <e> <s> more than half of the other road users involved told the police afterwards that they had not seen the motor-cyclist and this proportion remained the same when the other road user was also a motor-cyclist <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may cover the points before my noble friend lady macleod replies <e> <s> first may say to the noble lord lord noel-baker that i understand that regulations will be introduced to make rear brake lights compulsory on all machines <e> <s> we have recently consulted on the draft regulations and that is in hand so i hope he will be pleased about that <e> <s> with regard to the element of compulsion perhaps i may state clearly what is intended <e> <s> new machines will in fact compulsorily be fitted with the new kind of lamps i have mentioned and they will be wired into the ignition <e> <s> it will be possible if someone wants to go to the physical trouble that is involved to disconnect them <e> <s> at the present time the intention is that that is something they should be able to do <e> <s> as i say that i must admit that i cannot quite follow why that is the intention and i should want to take it away and discuss it further because as i stand here i could not give an explanation for the reason for that <e> <s> i shall want to <e>", "<cs> first i should like to speak to the amendment moved by the noble lady lady saltoun and say that we are very sympathetic to it <e> <s> i recall her raising the matter on second reading <e> <s> since then we have talked about it and i am pleased to be able to inform the committee that the government do not object to the principle behind this amendment <e> <s> some suitable devices for carrying babies on the front seat of cars are on the market and i understand that one such device it may indeed be the one which the noble lady has in mind is affectionately called a love seat the mind boggles <e> <s> if the committee has no objection to the use of such restraining devices for the front seats of cars then the government will correct any drafting errors that there may be in this amendment and bring it back on report <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lady and i hope that she will be gratified by my response <e> <s> i shall try if i can to cover the many points made by your lordships as follows <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether i am in or out of order but i was trying to say that in these two amendments together i wanted to make the response <e>", "<cs> that point is fair enough <e> <s> i am just wondering arising from what transpired earlier <e> <s> what <e>", "<cs> i do not think my noble friend has got it in the wrong order <e> <s> i myself was concerned that i might be getting it in the wrong order but i hope i did not in the end <e> <s> i will take careful note of what my noble friend says <e> <s> i am also well aware that earlier in the day before we had the major debate on the first issue the noble lord lord monson and others helpfully withdrew their amendments but reserved their right well they had the right anyway but they said they would come back at report stage if they wished <e> <s> i presume the same applies to the points made by my noble friend lord lucas <e> <s> when other proposals come forward we shall expect to discuss them properly in the usual way <e>", "<cs> i understand that the idea behind the noble baronesss proposal is among other things to secure the more effective enforcement of traffic regulations and i understand that the metropolitan police are very keen that the law should be amended so as to permit the use of immobilisation devices to be tested and i understand too that the planning and communications policy committee of the previous administration at county hall supported the proposal <e>", "<cs> this amendment and the clause to which it relates should be seen in the context of the governments firm conviction that the level of public spending and the burden on the taxpayer and the rate <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord lord underhill my noble friend lord kinnoull and other noble friends and noble lords who have spoken that the government have considerable sympathy with the views that have been put forward but the fact is that the clause is outside the scope of the bill <e> <s> it would not be appropriate to take up the time of the committee on this occasion to debate the arrangements for the transportation of freight by water <e> <s> i can however say that the government are aware of the desire of those responsible for our canal system to increase this freight traffic as much as they can <e> <s> this is a general objective with which the government are in sympathy <e>", "<cs> it is a great pleasure always not one i get too often to be able to accept the amendment which i hereby gladly do <e> <s> the nod was as good as a wink on this occasion and i am pleased to thank my noble friend for moving this amendment which we accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for the first part of his supplementary question <e> <s> it is a basic requisite of local authorities that they do exactly as my noble friend suggests and indeed the relaxation of planning rgimes is a fundamental part of this whole scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot state a time <e> <s> it will depend entirely upon what takes place <e> <s> we have always said that this is an experiment and i hope it will be felt to be an interesting not to say an exciting one but it is important to see exactly what transpires in practice before we can decide how soon and how much further if at all we go with this scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is referring to public warehousing and i have met delegations from two representative bodies <e> <s> we understand their concern and we have undertaken to monitor and to watch very carefully exactly what transpires within the zones as regards public warehousing <e> <s> should this become a greater problem than we anticipate we have powers to ameliorate it but i hope that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that any of the authorities who have been successful in obtaining an enterprise zone would have accepted in any way the description given by the noble baroness that the exercise is a cosmetic one <e> <s> certainly so far as the government are concerned it is anything but that <e> <s> it is exactly what we have always said it is it is an imaginative attempt to do something where nothing was done previously for very many years and the provision of infrastructure is something that we want to encourage <e> <s> basically the whole problem of these areas will be solved if the private sector is encouraged to come in and do things so that it will uplift the zone and the whole of the area <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment there is no contemplation of any zone beyond those which have been so designated <e> <s> the basic object of the exercise is to take derelict areas which need to be uplifted to involve people coming in and making investments and i should have thought that there would not be many rural areas which would look kindly on the kind of thing which we are hoping to attract <e> <s> however it is still an experiment and we shall have to wait and see what transpires <e>", "<cs> my lords specific grants are not available for these purposes except in the cases where there are urban development corporations and that concerns two of the zones <e> <s> other than that the whole of the infrastructure and everything else that goes into these zones will have to be provided by the private sector unless the local authorities wish to take part in that aspect of it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the aspects of the whole matter that concerns us <e> <s> there can be no guarantees at all <e> <s> i say again for the <e>", "<cs> my lords the local authority which is concerned and also we in central government will be watching generally <e> <s> we have not laid down a rgime as such but obviously we are keenly interested to see that the zones are a success <e> <s> we shall do everything we can to encourage them and we shall be in very close touch the whole of the time <e> <s> we feel that that should enable us to be assured of what is happening and in the case of the warehousing which was mentioned by the noble lord lord evans we shall be watching particularly closely <e>", "<cs> my lords this raises a very complex and difficult subject <e> <s> i am sure my noble friend would agree that it is only in unusual circumstances that consideration should be given to changing something which has gone through the procedure of inquiry and where a decision has been taken <e> <s> while there are <e>", "<cs> my lords i have looked into this particular case very carefully because my noble friend very kindly intimated that it was a cause of concern to him <e> <s> the information i have is that in this case the local authority have not in fact had a change of heart <e> <s> therefore to some extent the point is academic <e> <s> if that is not the information which the noble lord lord strabolgi has i can only tell him that this is what i have been told <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that flaxmans house was listed before the inquiry into the compulsory purchase order <e> <s> the inquiry was therefore a joint inquiry in which both the merits of the slum clearance compulsory purchase order and the case for giving consent to demolish this listed building were considered <e> <s> therefore it is surely fair to say that the merits of this building which justified its listing were taken into account in the inquiry and it was in the knowledge of these that the decision to demolish was taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> on checking the record i saw that my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords although of course i do not know i think it is probably right to say that the inspector at the time was referring solely to the question of fitness or unfitness of the dwelling for human habitation <e> <s> but obviously there are other factors as well which presumably are taken into account at the time of an inquiry <e> <s> i cannot comment upon what the individual inspector said at the time because i do not know of that <e> <s> i would reiterate what my noble friend lord mowbray and stourton said that the government are very sympathetic to cases like this and are willing to look at long-term possibilities to see whether there are any areas within the law which require any change <e> <s> but in the case of this particular dwelling the local authority itself is seemingly quite clear as to what it wishes to do and that is why i am answering in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can helpfully comment on that other than to say that i think the noble lord will appreciate that we really are sympathetic in these cases and want to see retained every building which ought to be retained <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend has said that this is a matter which is certainly worthy of consideration and we will give it consideration <e> <s> i am not myself aware at the present time of any immediate prospect of the matter being dealt with but nevertheless i know that the question of a fit property within an area of general unfitness being brought in within a total cpo for the purposes of making it a proper demolition matter is being considered <e> <s> however i think that that is slightly different from the specific question that i was asked <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill asked whether there was any indication of how the percentage will be broken down between employees and managers <e> <s> at this stage i have no <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to what both noble lords had to say and i would respond first to the noble lord lord underhill who asked was the study now being rejected <e> <s> i say that no it is not rejected at all <e> <s> i would remind him that the report was conditional and it was conditional upon certain achievements for example on the continuation of the flourishing side of the inter-city programme and certain improvements <e> <s> unhappily it has to be said that has not taken place and at no stage was it said there would be a blanket commitment to invest come what may <e> <s> indeed what we are now proposing is not the <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may just make a brief comment on the observations by the noble lord lord taylor that the railways industry is a service industry indeed but one has to look at the amount of investment already being made in terms of the external financing limits which have in fact gone up to million and for this year are to be million <e> <s> the government have also increased the cash ceiling on the pso grant for to million which is million higher than that previously planned <e> <s> so i think it is fair to say that the government recognise the role of the railways and that this is really a problem with which everyone together is faced in trying to achieve what we are trying to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i cannot comment on an individual situation but if the noble lord would like me to write to him about it i would be glad to do so <e> <s> one has to say that of course there are bound to be some lines which will be profitable and some which will not be but the totality of it is that the inter-city trains are only running to per cent <e> <s> of capacity <e> <s> this is a considerable problem that faces us again if we are all trying to get to where we want to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to anticipate what might be said at the meeting to which i referred earlier <e> <s> but it may be helpful to my noble friend if i say that it is intended in any case that there shall be discussion at the time of the annual report which the board brings out and to look at progress that is being made and at projects that may be brought forward subject to the conditions which i have mentioned <e> <s> but i want to repeat in case there should be any misunderstanding that basically the government are in agreement with the report in which they took part it is only that that report was conditional and that we <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing to add to that <e> <s> i heard what my noble friend said <e>", "<cs> my lords in commenting on all the points which have been made by your lordships i cannot resist the temptation to comment first on the observations made by the last speaker the noble lord lord jenkins of putney <e> <s> he said that the noble baroness lady birk may not receive the assurances that she wants <e> <s> she may indeed not receive the assurances that she wants but assurances she will certainly get from me and an answer to all the points that she made <e> <s> whether the noble baroness will be satisfied with the answers she gets only she can decide <e> <s> but i assure noble lords that the noble baroness will get answers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness may well say that it is locally friendless but she would have to bring a lot of evidence to convince me that there is nobody locally who is for it <e> <s> however this clearly cannot be done now <e> <s> i owe it to the noble baroness specifically i shall do it as quickly as i can to refer to the five points which she made regarding assurances <e> <s> on consultation before laying further orders i should point out that a consultative memorandum on the proposed planning rgime was issued on th february <e> <s> comments were received and considered <e> <s> a meeting was held with the local authorities and the shadow corporation and revised proposals were circulated for comment <e> <s> the noble baronesss reference to only seven days being allowed for consultation was somewhat misleading <e> <s> may i assure the noble baroness and the house that we shall continue to consult all those who are involved about proposed orders <e>", "<cs> my lords what i did was to assure the house that the lddc will do its utmost to reach agreements with local authorities <e> <s> no one can say that it will reach agreement on every point but i know that the importance of so doing is well appreciated by all concerned because it has been said by nearly every speaker and i endorse that <e> <s> if for some reason we cannot work with them the progress will be slow <e>", "<cs> my lords i made the point when we were discussing the last pair of amendments that if there was to be any point in taking powers of direction the powers needed to be as clear as possible <e> <s> if there is ambiguity about the way they are drafted or if the uses to which they can be put are uncertain the powers are not worth having <e> <s> the powers are wanted to ensure that the governments policy of privatisation can be achieved it is not an appropriate role for an independent inquiry to examine the merits of declared government policy <e> <s> for that the secretary of state is answerable to parliament <e> <s> when during the committee stage of the bill the noble viscount lord simon originally suggested the possibility of arbitration or an inquiry to settle differences of view between the board and the government the noble lord lord mishcon said <e>", "<cs> my lords surely in all situations of this kind all matters that would indicate a deviation from anything which has been said as regards the general policy are normally reported to parliament <e> <s> it was in that sense that i said that parliament would then be able to have its say <e> <s> it was in that sense i meant it rather than the wording of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see why we should be so pessimistic <e> <s> the scenario which noble lords opposite have painted is certainly not one which i envisage at all <e> <s> the fact is that the governments whole policy is founded on their agreement with the board that something must be done to improve the prospects of their subsidiaries <e> <s> this agreement is the keystone of the policy and has shaped the provisions which are now included in the bill <e> <s> if that had not been the case it would have been quite feasible for us to take a different approach and introduce a bill transferring certain businesses to the ownership of the secretary of state and empowering him to dispose of them as he thought fit the whole of the proceeds going straight to the exchequer with some reduction in the boards debt to take account of the loss of the assets concerned <e> <s> these are publicly-owned assets and that would have been a justifiable way to treat them <e> <s> it would have given the government direct control over the exercise <e> <s> i do not deny that such a course would have raised some difficult problems or <e>", "<cs> my lords i see that my noble friend who is always so assiduous and ever watchful on all matters concerning the isle of wight they are fortunate indeed to have someone who takes such a regular and <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house for which i think i must ask at this stage i cannot answer my noble friend on that point <e> <s> however i undertake to include consideration of it in the review to which i referred a few moments ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will recall that we recently debated an identical amendment during the committee stage of the bill and the noble lord lord underhill in fact has basically repeated although at a somewhat more civilised hour the same arguments as to why he favours the creation of a strong centralised ports authority but i have to say that nothing i have heard him say tonight convinces me that the governments decision to abolish the national ports council is misconceived <e> <s> i will not repeat all that i said during the committee stage but there are just one or two points that i think i should emphasise <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i think it would be helpful to him if i were to say another brief word about the report <e> <s> i understand that what happened was that that report was instituted by the then secretary of state who asked the council to carry out consultations on it <e> <s> the noble lord may or may not be aware that those consultations had not been completed by the time of the last general election <e> <s> the council when it did make the report to my right honourable friend late in advised in much less centralising terms <e> <s> the report was in effect at least withdrawn <e> <s> clearly one can interpret that in the way one would want to do but i thought i should make the point because i had not said a great deal on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to have an opportunity to refer to the future arrangements being made for the work which has been carried out in the past by the council <e> <s> in the first place i must emphasise that the amendment would run counter to our policy of making the industry more responsible for its own affairs <e> <s> the fact is that almost all of the councils statutory functions are being abolished <e> <s> in some cases this will mean that a function will no longer be carried out at all <e> <s> for example its duty to prepare a national ports plan <e> <s> i have already explained that this has been a dead letter for many years and we think it would be wrong to perpetuate it <e> <s> in other cases for example in research and training and in providing assistance to harbour authorities in the exercise of their functions the responsibility has been taken over by the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to thank my noble friend for giving us the opportunity briefly to discuss further this important issue and hopefully to reassure both your lordships house and motor-cyclists about our intentions <e> <s> at present we have a situation where only a small minority some per cent <e> <s> of learner motor-cyclists take a course of training and far too many continue to ride indefinitely without taking a test <e> <s> everyone would agree that this is unsatisfactory <e> <s> it is in stark contrast to the position of learner car drivers <e> <s> ninety-five per cent <e> <s> of them take professional tuition and they are only too keen to pass their test <e> <s> their inducement to do so is the fact that they have to be accompanied <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of my knowledge i do not know that it will be necessary to pass two tests <e> <s> there are two parts <e> <s> it is a question of how you define what is one or two tests <e> <s> you can have one test in two parts or you can call it two tests <e> <s> if my noble friend would like details i shall be glad to see that he gets them <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that i do not think that there is a necessity for the amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord strathcarron is so eminent a person in this field and so knowledgeable <e> <s> i know that he has discussed this matter with colleagues <e> <s> we hope that he is satisfied on this point <e> <s> he represents very much the interests of motor-cyclists and motor-cycling and in many ways he is one of our bench marks <e> <s> he will probably be pleased to know that that is so <e> <s> but it is right that it should be so <e> <s> i do not think that i ought to go further on this point <e> <s> if my noble friend lord strathcarron wishes to comment further i should be glad to hear his comment <e> <s> but i think we have it fairly right at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend hits it on the head <e> <s> of course it would be wrong to bring in the regulations prescribing the new two part motor-cycle test until we were satisfied that the sufficient training facilities for learner riders were available together with training bodies authorised to conduct the part i tests on their trainees <e> <s> my right honourable and honourable friends have no intention of allowing their motor-cycle safety proposals in this bill to fail because of inadequate facilities <e> <s> they have proposed introducing the new motor-cycle test on st january because of the urgency they attach to acting to deal with the frightening level of motor-cycle accidents <e> <s> but they will not bring in the new test until the necessary facilities are available <e>", "<cs> my lords for the convenience of the house i will speak both to this amendment and to no <e> <s> the consequential amendment in schedule <e> <s> in earlier prints of the bill we had failed to notice that schedule to the town and country planning act already contains a paragraph a inserted by paragraph of schedule to the local government planning and land act <e> <s> the new paragraph being inserted by this bill must therefore become <e>", "<cs> my lords may i perhaps say at this stage to help the house that when we come to them i intend to move amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i beg to move amendments nos <e> <s> and and at the same time speak briefly to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> section of the town and country planning act imposes requirements relating to the notification of planning applications to owners and agricultural tenants <e> <s> doubts have arisen about how these requirements should be operated and their practicability in the case of applications relating to underground mining where the workings may extend under several square miles of land <e> <s> we have concluded that in such cases it is unreasonable to expect the applicant to serve individual notices on every landowner who may be affected and that the posting of public notices in every parish or community within which any part of the land is situated is a reasonable alternative procedure <e> <s> the amendment makes provision for this alternative procedure to be followed in the case of planning applications for underground mining operations <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their said amendment <e> <s> the main purpose of clause of the bill is to ensure that the owners of mineral rights know about minerals planning applications which may affect them <e> <s> however we consider that there are some mineral rights for which this kind of individual notification is not required and the purpose of the original subsections c and d was to provide a procedure for an order to be made requiring notification to be given to the owners of these excluded minerals or minerals planning applications in cases where they wished to be so notified <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a technical drafting amendment <e> <s> i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in the said amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment <e> <s> i hope that it will be for the convenience of the house if i speak to amendment no <e> <s> as well as this one <e> <s> these amendments transfer the definition of forestry from the schedule to the after-care provisions in clause <e> <s> i understand that they have been promoted by the private forestry sector and that they are acceptable to the forestry commission <e> <s> as far as the purposes of this bill are concerned the amendments will not affect these in any way and i therefore beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving the last amendment i was also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in the said amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment <e> <s> at report stage in this house my noble friend lord mottistone asked me whether a planned sequence of consented operations was legal under the existing provisions of section of the act and if not whether the government would consider an appropriate amendment of the law <e> <s> at that time i undertook to consider this point while rejecting my noble friends arguments to display section altogether in relation to mineral working <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will feel that this amendment will be helpful <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i beg to move amendments nos <e> <s> to together <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and are purely drafting amendments <e> <s> doubts had been expressed about the clarity of the existing text in particular whether some of the subsections in part duplicated each other <e> <s> this clause is therefore redrafted in a clearer and more succinct way <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i beg to move amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> concern was expressed in this house and also in another place about the power which clause would give to a mineral planning authority to make an order prohibiting further mineral working at a site where working has ceased for two years <e> <s> at third reading in this house i repeated my earlier promise to consider whether prohibition orders should be limited to abandoned workings <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in the said amendment <e> <s> a prohibition order under clause may impose requirements for the purpose of removing or alleviating any injury to amenity <e> <s> the amendment excludes from the definition of injury to amenity damage caused by mining subsidence <e> <s> we have received representations from the national coal board that the provisions of this section should not be applied to mining subsidence as in the case of coal such <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is a consequence of earlier amendments here <e> <s> i beg to move that this house doth agree

believe will be on so great a scale that we might then have to abandon our proposals and start all over again <e> <s> that would be a great shame <e> <s> no noble lords who have spoken have really doubted that basically the machines are accurate and that they will become even more accurate <e> <s> the government have given undertakings as i gave in my remarks that the machines will continue to be accurate and will become more accurate <e> <s> for that reason we want the legislation to go forward so as to make a major contribution to road safety if i may use the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i can and do gladly confirm that these amendments which will ensure that all regulations under the new section are subject to affirmative resolution procedure and will thus require the approval of both houses of parliament are acceptable to the government <e> <s> regarding amendment no <e> <s> to which the noble lord lord monson referred i am able to say that we are not unsympathetic to this and would most certainly want to consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords could i say to the noble lord lord monson about amendment no <e> <s> if the house will allow me to do so as i think it has relevance to this whole series of amendments that i ought to put right a misapprehension which he may have as a result of what i said before <e> <s> although we feel the amendment will need checking and altering for drafting purposes and although we feel that it adds little to what we should do anyway we have no objection to it in principle <e> <s> i felt that i should say that now because i hope it will be helpful as our proceedings continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the power to prescribe is defined in section of the road traffic act and it simply means prescribe by regulations made by the secretary of state <e> <s> the power to prescribe descriptions of seat belts is already found in section of that act and the construction and use regulations already contain provisions as to seat belts <e> <s> but there are other regulations which stem from that subsection and other regulations will stem from this new clause <e> <s> the manner and location in which the relevant descriptions are prescribed is i think one of form which i suggest is best left to be determined in the future <e> <s> it may be for example that it would seem most appropriate to have one self-contained set of regulations applicable to this clause alone <e> <s> however the government would of course ensure that there was no conflict between different sets of regulations <e> <s> there is no intention to use clause to impose the obligation on cars which already have seat belts compulsorily fitted and i hope that the noble lord may perhaps feel that he need not go further with this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this amendment is based on a misunderstanding of the extent of the present clause <e> <s> this makes it an offence not to wear a belt when driving or riding in a vehicle on a road <e> <s> by virtue of section of the road traffic act a road is any highway and any other road to which the public has access and includes bridges over which a road passes <e>", "<cs> my lords can i say first of all with the leave of the house that i understand that this does not apply to doctors <e> <s> with regard to the definition of local rounds i tried a few moments ago to draw a distinction between rounds where there is a need to stop frequently every few yards and those where there are long distances to travel between each stop yet a delivery man could be said to be a person in charge of a vehicle that was having to stop <e> <s> i think it is a question of the regularity of the stops distance between them that is the distinction <e> <s> like much in this legislation this amendment is an attempt to try to meet a very fairly raised point that it does not make sense to have compulsion on people where clearly it is not practicable <e> <s> we want legislation that makes sense <e> <s> it is an attempt to meet that we are trying to find a form of words that will achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time i am grateful to my noble friend for coming to my aid on this matter and as a general principle i entirely endorse what he said <e> <s> it is in the regulations that we shall have the answers to lots of these points <e> <s> nevertheless i think i would go back on the particular question put to me by my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye and repeat what i said that we are surely concerned here with local roundsmen people stopping and starting outside every house in every other street <e> <s> once we go beyond that we are coming to something else <e> <s> nevertheless as my noble friend lord lucas said there is clearly much area here for further definition and clarification in the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am told the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i hear what the noble lady says <e> <s> when my noble friend lord balfour asked what is a short delivery <e> <s> i was very tempted to say that now the test match is over i do not think a definition is required <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards amendment no <e> <s> i should just like to say that i am grateful to my noble friend for what she has said <e> <s> the point which she has raised is an interesting one <e> <s> apart from what i have said about the ultimate need for the regulations i want to give her an assurance that guidance in one form or another in any case will certainly be issued <e>", "<cs> my lords with such a list of questions posed to me i think that your lordships would agree that the best thing i can do is quickly to retreat behind the magic word consultation <e> <s> that i do i readily confess <e> <s> it would be fair to say that in fact under the proposed regulations medical certificates could be for either a limited or an unlimited duration of time for specific periods or not <e> <s> we would not envisage that they should state the condition on them which has justified the issue of the certificate <e> <s> however as i say we shall read very carefully what has been said <e> <s> we shall ensure that the points raised will be included in the consultations which have to take place with the medical profession <e>", "<cs> my lords with equally commendable brevity might i say that this is a difficult area and is certainly another which must be left for regulations <e> <s> however it would be fair to say that it could be open to much criticism on a number of counts for example impracticability is one thing mere discomfort is quite another <e> <s> however i think that we might leave this one with the assurance that the government are aware of this particular problem and would consider how best to deal with it under regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords again and i keep saying this because it is the position we shall look at this in regard to regulations <e> <s> but it is right to say that the police for example may feel that they do not want to be exempted <e> <s> in fact when enforcing a law they might feel very inhibited if they are not themselves wearing seat belts <e> <s> but we are talking about compulsion are we not <e> <s> even so we must look at this and the other categories referred to in the amendment very carefully and we certainly will do so in the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a most effective reply if i may say so <e> <s> i would just make two brief points on these amendments <e> <s> first it seems to me that they really would have a rather dramatically adverse effect upon compulsion because they would potentially enable all drivers to obtain exemption if they wanted it <e> <s> the amendment provides for no kind of test of the declaration and indeed i do not see how one could be provided <e> <s> if very large numbers of drivers obtained exemption the consequence would be as i have said in relation to earlier amendments that the law would be impossible to enforce effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not dissent from what has been said about the cost of accidents <e> <s> however i should like to point out that such a provision would give rise to a number of difficulties <e> <s> what would <e>", "<cs> my lords i would imagine that the purpose of this amendment is basically to provide a safeguard against the possibility that fees for medical certificates may be unreasonably high <e> <s> i gather that is what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> i certainly understand this feeling but in our view the power in this subsection is very much a reserve power which we would not wish to use <e> <s> fees must be decided by the medical profession or at the very least in agreement with them <e> <s> if we attempted to impose limits which were totally unacceptable to them they could simply refuse to issue certificates and we would have no power to compel them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we all want seat belts to be of the very best possible design and no one would claim that present designs are the ultimate <e> <s> however in the context of the bill my concern is that the devices called for in this amendment do not exist at the present time <e> <s> i imagine that their development and fitting to all cars would take many years <e> <s> my noble friend lord cork and orrery was fair enough in saying that he appreciated that should this amendment be pressed and accepted then implementation of compulsion would have to be shelved for a long time <e> <s> how long it would have to be shelved i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that i am not in favour of the amendment <e> <s> with regard to the first part of it it seems that it is rather unnecessary to set up a further piece of bureacratic machinery <e> <s> if a doctor refuses to issue a medical certificate there is nothing to stop an applicant going to as many other doctors as he wishes and i cannot believe that if several doctors concur in the view that he should not be issued with a certificate the secretary of state would decide otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not without some trepidation that i endeavour to say what reasonable excuse really means <e> <s> my understanding of it has always been that in fact it is not of itself a defence but that it can be used in mitigation as to the extent of penalties or whatever <e> <s> if may say so as a magistrate of many years standing that has always been my understanding of it and if you want to have it in legislation you had better put it in as said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend and i am sorry to embarrass him in this way but what i was trying to get at was a means of drawing the attention of the police to the fact that they do not have to prosecute in every case where the seat belt was not fastened <e> <s> this is what i was really trying to get at whether or not there is a strict provision in the regulations <e> <s> i am sure there will be many cases where the police will say to themselves it is really not worth prosecuting in this case <e> <s> if a good reason is given for not having fastened the seat belt i would like to make certain their attention is drawn to this and that they do not have to prosecute if they are convinced there is a reasonable excuse <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is doing very well <e> <s> the government is pretty neutral on this <e> <s> we will be prepared if that is what the house feels to accept this amendment <e> <s> i understand that some drafting changes may be necessary in that the words aids abets and permits are the terms which may not actually be correctly used here but if that is what the house decides it wants we will accept it in the attempt to be helpful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if the noble lord lord monson would care to comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords as the amendment is drafted it appears to have the effect that a person charged with not wearing a seat belt has a defence if he can show that any person whatever whether or not he was involved in the circumstances leading up to the prosecution was saved from death or suffered less serious injury as a result of not wearing a belt <e> <s> this would mean that only one such incident need be established and no prosecution thereafter could succeed <e> <s> i am sure that this would not be a sensible result <e> <s> i suspect it is not what the noble lord lord monson intended <e> <s> but it would be the effect of it <e> <s> having said that it remains the case that even one case would be difficult to prove because if a person was actually not wearing a belt when an accident happened it must always remain a matter of speculation what would have <e>", "<cs> my lords the affirmative resolution point is dealt with in as they have now become amendments nos <e> <s> a and <e> <s> on the question of making regulations under clause subject to the affirmative resolution procedure the government agree in principle that this should be done in resepct of regulations which introduce compulsory wearing or extend it to new classes of vehicle or seating positions <e> <s> this result is effectively achieved by amendment no <e> <s> a tabled by my noble friend lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> i therefore commend that amendment to the house rather than paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are quite neutral on this question of the expiry and renewal of regulations made under clause <e> <s> as far as we are concerned it is up to the house if the house decides that this is acceptable we are content <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if i was to set out to try to do all that my noble friend lord mottistone requires we should forget the whole thing <e> <s> i shall read carefully what he said especially about a prerequisite for this legislation <e> <s> i am trying to remember all that he said it was very impressive as what he says always is <e> <s> but in terms of its being practical if we are seriously to proceed to carry out the wishes of the house then i do not think that it could get off the ground <e>", "<cs> my lords if you start from the assumption that seat belts are desirable things to wear then i might well ask the same question who will compensate her for the facial injuries that she might suffer as a result of an accident due to not wearing a seat belt <e> <s> when the record shows and is not this what it is all about <e> <s> that the likely effect upon her is far more devastating <e> <s> i should have thought that that was a very relevant point to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised at some of the remarks that have been made <e> <s> if as a maximum fine and it must be stressed that we are talking about a maximum is considered to be too high i must say that i know from experience of the road traffic act that the number of occasions when in my many years as a magistrate i never liked doing the road traffic act part of it maximum fines were imposed were very few indeed <e> <s> frankly i cannot remember a single instance when that happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been saying that all day <e> <s> i have been saying how right it is that we should consider where there should be exemptions <e> <s> certainly we have spent some hours today talking about just that <e> <s> of course my noble friend is right to make his point in his own very able way <e> <s> all i am saying is putting this amendment in the context of all that we are seeking to do with seat belt legislation that i consider that the maximum will not have the adverse effect that my noble friend fears it will <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think we add a great deal to the debate by indulging in extravagant language and to say that the proposals are forcing citizens to put their lives at risk really my lords <e> <s> anyhow my note here says so i will say that the government are wholly neutral on the issue of compulsory seat belt wearing itself but we are not similarly neutral on this amendment which we could not accept <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking first of all to amendment no <e> <s> za i feel that this amendment has value only as a declaration of intent and as such would not be binding on successor parliaments <e> <s> if parliament subsequently should decide that it wished to make the offence of failing to wear a belt simply one for disqualification and points it could do so by primary legislation which would also delete this amendment <e> <s> this amendment would not have any impact on subordinate legislation as we shall not have the power under clause to add offences to the schedule of those attracting points <e> <s> furthermore the secretary of state has no power to make an offence subject to penalty points or disqualification by regulation <e> <s> therefore there really is nothing on which <e>", "<cs> my lords i think everyone would sympathise with the problem which the noble lord has raised <e> <s> i should have thought that just about everyone who drives a car has at one time or another felt so frustrated at being in this situation many many times if it comes to that <e> <s> so there is no lack of sympathy with the philosophy that the noble lord has expressed i would certainly hasten to assure him of that <e> <s> but while i can understand the intention the problem is in being able to accept his solution <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why this amendment was acceptable to the government and why the other amendments were not acceptable was because they were defective in that they did not remove a from the negative procedure <e> <s> therefore it would have been subject to both the affirmative and the negative procedures <e> <s> that is why this amendment is acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to go over this again <e> <s> i would only be repeating exactly what i said earlier <e> <s> the amendment needs checking and altering for drafting purposes <e> <s> although we think it adds little to what we would do anyway nevertheless we have no objection in principle and we will bring it back in a form which i am sure will be acceptable to all those in favour of it <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is as i know it is the wish of your lordships that this clause be added to the bill the government will gladly accept it and will further ensure that an appropriate money resolution is moved in another place <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord underhill my noble friend lord ferrier and others who have brought forward this very constructive provision which we are glad to accept <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has tabled this amendment in order to ensure that when this bill is returned to the other place honourable members there should be able to include northern ireland in their discussions on clause <e> <s> this seems surely both sensible and courteous and on that basis i should like to welcome the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble baroness lady stedman says is most interesting <e> <s> i shall gladly look into her suggestion about defining in more detail the penny rate and exactly what it does or does not comprise <e> <s> yes i shall bear very much in mind what she has said <e> <s> i think she knows that i am by no means unsympathetic to the problems which face the parish councils <e> <s> on the other hand there is the great concern of the district councils which take an opposite point of view and in this case as so often in life one is involved in trying to get a balance in between <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time the noble lord although always fascinating in the questions he asks leads the subject very wide of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment takes up again a theme which we discussed both in committee and at report stage <e> <s> the noble lord is not convinced despite extensive assurances which i have given that the present or future secretaries of state might use these powers in an irresponsible or vindictive way <e> <s> i have to say that this latest amendment is no more acceptable to the government than the others which we have already discussed and for reasons with which the house will by now be familiar <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is concerned with a technical legal matter and i am afraid that in explaining why i think it is unnecessary i shall have to resort to the use of legal technicalities <e> <s> as i explained during the report stage the clause relates only to roads as defined by section of the road traffic act <e> <s> these are highways and any other road to which the public has access <e> <s> i do not think we are concerned today with highways <e> <s> as to other roads <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i cannot say that because i am not sure how far putting up a notice of that kind could be sustained based upon the access points to which i have referred <e> <s> so i do not think that that would be enough to cover the point <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house it would be very easy to say that and let it go at that but i do not want to mislead the house at all <e> <s> as always we will read very carefully what has been said and the noble lord can be assured that my colleagues will think about the matter carefully <e> <s> but i feel that the points that i made very much based as they were upon the legalities and problems that would ensue if the amendment were put into the bill are a cause for real concern not the motivation <e> <s> nevertheless i certainly undertake that we will look at the point although i cannot promise that we will be able to come back or indeed that it might be taken within the regulations which i know is what the noble lord would like <e>", "<cs> under section of the interpretation act words in the singular include the plural and words in the plural include the singular <e> <s> the clause has been drafted so that all the exceptions <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may join in <e> <s> i appreciate that there are a number who would suffer varying degrees of anxiety about being made to wear seat belts because they believe that wearing seat belts would be worse in an accident <e> <s> this could be because <e>", "<cs> my lords in my one speaking note i tried to cover it all by saying that the part where i refer to the medical condition generally i feel comes within the scope of the section to which my noble friend refers but that the anxiety aspect of it does not <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that the provisions inserted in the bill on report to ensure that all the regulations made under this clause would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure might have enabled us to avoid going over some of the old ground <e> <s> as i explained during the committee stage the government would have no intention of requiring someone to wear a seat belt where there is no requirement to fit a belt <e> <s> therefore those travelling in vintage cars will not have to wear seat belts because none has to be fitted <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that his amendment really is not necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only admire the facile solution which the noble lord lord monson seems to have found for the problems facing my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer i am sure that he will read with much interest the very substantial sums of money which the noble lords amendment would find <e>", "<cs> my lords if it may help the house i have with me and could read out what was said <e> <s> it is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords when we considered that i think i had better refer to as a similar amendment on report the noble lord lord spens clearly explained why he thought the house should support that amendment and i had every sympathy with the reasons he gave as indeed i have sympathy with the basic point underlying this amendment <e> <s> however as i said last week it is a difficult task to say the least to establish what might have happened in the event of an accident had or had not someone worn a seat belt <e> <s> we must face the fact that there may well be unfortunate cases when one could speculate that if someone had not worn a seat belt then they might have been saved from the worst effects of the accident <e> <s> but surely the point is that the number of such cases will be very few compared to those where the wearing of a seat belt would have saved death or injury or would have had a significantly mitigating effect upon an accident situation <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that is semantics <e> <s> i think that a mental state in the terms of a medical condition is something that the medical profession will advise us upon in due course <e> <s> i am no more qualified to dissertate on that subject than so far as i am aware is my noble friend although possibly he has the advantage of me in that way <e> <s> i am trying hard in all this seat belt discussion to try to take an objective view about it because i realise how deeply felt are the feelings of those with both points of view <e> <s> but if when we come to regulations we approach it in the right spirit then we will get something that will at least be acceptable to just about everyone in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord monson misses the whole point my lords because this has nothing to do with elections <e> <s> indeed the provision is not even basically in a government clause the provision was moved initially by my noble friend lord nugent and the government took a neutral line on it <e> <s> the house as a whole right across party lines voted on this issue and so far as i am aware the same will happen in another place <e> <s> in no way is it a political issue and to bring that aspect into it does not help the substance of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to press the point about what may or may not be in order for consideration at third reading but the fact is that your lordships clearly voted at report stage to accept the maximum fine of and to go over this once again really is taking us round the track once more <e> <s> but i think i would still want myself to make one or two observations on what my noble friend has said <e> <s> first the wearing rate in west germany is only per cent <e> <s> and it is therefore far lower than in those countries where there is a penalty and i think that point ought to be made <e> <s> without going further because i do not think it is right that we should i would only say that this amendment would make a nonsense of the whole clause and of course i certainly could not support what is in fact a wrecking amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should perhaps note that we are in some danger here of becoming enmeshed in a particular fiscal matter outside the scope of the provisions of the bill and our remit in these matters <e> <s> be that as it may while i understand the intentions of the noble lord lord underhill on this point i cannot accept that a reduced vehicle excise duty burden on the lorries used by educational suppliers is appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will give way for a moment <e> <s> i should have said that the position of estate cars being used for this purpose is something we would be willing to look at <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission i should <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way perhaps i may give him some information which is helpful <e> <s> perhaps i should explain that the point i was making about the act concerned consultations about the taxi trade that were going to take place <e> <s> i do not want to mislead the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say first that i apologise for speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i thought that it had been agreed beforehand and as i gather that it had not been agreed i apologise to the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> there was no intention to put them together on any other basis <e>", "<cs> my lords without going into detail which i do not think my noble friend requires me to do i am glad to say that we are pleased to accept this amendment and i gladly pay tribute to his assiduity in pushing this forward <e>", "<cs> my lords we have gone into this matter in considerable depth but i wish to spend a little longer replying now than my noble friend the chief whip who has just entered the chamber would want me to do i feel obliged to do so because of the concern which has been expressed by the noble viscount lord simon and by my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> if i go into the matter in some depth my remarks will go on the record and that may be helpful <e> <s> to take the question asked by my noble friend lord mottistone i can only comment that as always everything that is said will be carefully considered and whether or not the other place will wish to do something is for the other place to decide i cannot say <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak again on that point i went on to say that while we could not accept the amendment the other place would read very carefully as we always do what has been said and if that should be an influence upon their thinking they would know what to do <e> <s> however so far as this house is concerned we cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is absolutely right <e> <s> i apologise to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i was interested to hear what the noble lord lord underhill said in regard to this amendment <e> <s> he will know that i do not share his pessimistic view of my right honourable friends ability to carry out his responsibilities effectively after the abolition of the national ports council <e> <s> but i do not believe that a report of the sort provided for in the amendment offers the best way of informing parliament of how he is exercising his responsibilities <e> <s> many opportunities arise in practice whether through questions statements or debates to discuss ports matters <e> <s> if noble lords or honourable members in another place wish to discuss the ports industry the governments ports policy or indeed more specific questions my right honourable friend and his colleagues welcome the opportunity of such discussions <e> <s> they can take place on the issues of the day and be relevant to current problems <e> <s> this is likely to provide the basis for a more worthwhile discussion than a single report months after the appointed day on a rather <e>", "<cs> my lords on this occasion i will not repeat the reasons why the government are not prepared to accept an extension of the provisions of section of the harbour act to cover all port charges because we spoke on this at much length during the earlier stages and it is recorded in <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear however helpful one wants to be i am not in a position to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord nugent of guildford not for the first time because i too would have wanted to say that we had a very full debate on this whole question during the report stage <e> <s> there was indeed a large turn-out for the vote although i acknowledge that the result was as the noble lord said <e> <s> but what in fact the noble lord lord underhill is now saying ostensibly is that we should not restrict the right to a further blood test until some experience has been gained in the operation of the breath machines and <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> in all we have spent many hours debating this bill <e> <s> i am told that amendments have been tabled and and this is significant more than amendments to the bill have been agreed to <e> <s> apart from minor technical amendments of which i am glad to say that there have been relatively few the main amendments to which we have agreed have been to the road safety provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend would draw my attention to specific details i would be very glad to have a look at them <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is no collection at all then the authority concerned is not carrying out its statutory duty <e> <s> i know of no such case <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord with his obviously vast experience is referring of course to the collection of trade refuse and indeed there are situations where that is done at weekends <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made substantial improvements since taking office despite a per cent <e> <s> increase in the volume of appeals <e> <s> improved productivity in the department has enabled us to contain this increase and still reduce the times taken to determine cases <e> <s> however we believe there is scope for much <e>", "<cs> again my lords as i said in answer to the last question one would need to have specific instances brought to ones attention to be able to give a thoroughly satisfactory reply on a specific case <e> <s> but in general may i refer my noble friend to a recent circular <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not agree <e> <s> i gladly pay tribute to the fact that local authorities have made a contribution to this improvement i am very pleased to acknowledge that but i think i should also say in view of the point that the noble baroness makes that in fact the governments actions certainly have focussed the attention of local authorities on this issue and i think i would be entitled to refer to the increasing productivity in the doe planning inspectorate <e> <s> in fact in terms of the number of appeals that they have had to deal with they have gone up by some per cent <e> <s> and the time factor has been materially improved <e>", "<cs> my lords as always the noble baroness fails to take into consideration the improved efficiency of local authorities and it is that i would suggest which is a material contribution to the improved performance to which i have gladly paid tribute <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the government have said and i am glad to confirm this yet again that the circular in question makes it quite clear that there is no departure that is envisaged from current policies restricting development in green belts <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only assume that the noble lord is referring to the difference in making appeals other than by written statement and if he would care to bring to my notice specific instances i should be glad to have a look at them <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that we are going rather wide of the original question <e> <s> i am aware of the statement to which the noble lord refers and it may indeed have both effects that he mentioned <e> <s> in both circumstances i think that would be a rather unfortunate situation <e>", "<cs> my lords at the present time that is exactly the situation <e> <s> but i want to say that my right honourable friend the secretary of state has said that in looking at all expenditure in the total by local government if local authorities are unwilling to meet the governments targets as set down then we shall have to look at the possibility of legislation in the next session to bring home to individual authorities and the electorates the consequences of high-spending policies and to make councils more accountable <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is totally irrelevant to the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen the note in the press to which my noble friend refers and can only say that if ever there was a case of vote now pay later this must be being very much brought home to the electorate in london <e> <s> the fact is that the consequences of that kind of increase are very serious for employment and they have no interest at all in peoples ability to pay <e> <s> this must of course be the kind of thing that does so much to detract from the central government/local government relationship <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have again to say that that is not relevant to the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware whether the government are or are not giving consideration to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i would only say something that i have said before in answering questions <e> <s> it was always the proud boast of local government that it worked within the parameters set down by central government so far as the totality of spending was concerned <e> <s> it is only now that for the first time we are seeing something quite new <e> <s> we are seeing situations where certain authorities are not willing to work within and indeed set out to thwart the policies of central government which is a new factor in the whole situation <e>", "<cs> again my lords we are very much off the question <e> <s> but the fact is that the government are certainly not at all responsible as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> the government are entitled to decide what they think the country can afford and to expect the same response from local government as has always been given in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to give the same reply as i gave to the noble lord lord spens i really do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords may i deal first with the points raised by the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> when she asks whether the new auditors will be empowered to make political judgments the answer of course is clearly no any more than district auditors make political judgments now <e> <s> the people who will be appointed through the commission will be district auditors they have not made political judgments nor will they and i should not have thought that it was a matter for public concern that such outside expertise should be brought in <e> <s> it should be a matter of some public relief in fact because although i pay great tribute to the work of the district auditor service which i think does an excellent job and i have not heard anyone say other than that the fact is that in the main they have not concentrated on value for money exercises to the extent that we hope will be possible for others who come in and bring with them certain commercial expertise and knowledge <e> <s> so that is one benefit which i think will be gained <e>", "<cs> my lords if local government was able to save of per cent <e> <s> it would represent million so when i said that there was a prize to go for i do not think i was exaggerating <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble baroness does not believe what i say but i was only giving an indication i was not saying that this is the justification for the basic motivation of what we are doing here by appointing an audit commission <e> <s> i was trying to indicate the opportunity that would exist for there to be general savings <e> <s> however i must touch on a point also made by the noble baroness lady birk when she referred to accountability <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his remarks and his encouragement <e> <s> so far as the public accounts committee is concerned of course i think everyone is indeed glad that they look so closely as they do at this work <e> <s> in fact i ought to have said to the noble baroness lady birk that what we are embarked upon here with an audit commission in fact is not the recommendation of the public accounts committee <e> <s> local government would have felt frankly we felt too much more concern had we gone the route that they proposed <e> <s> nevertheless we felt that their basic concern and their recommendations for greater accountability and involvement in this way were very valid hence the point of my noble friend with which i very much agree <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last point the noble baroness lady stedman makes the powers are the same and will be the same as they are now neither more nor less <e> <s> they are independent the district auditor is independent <e> <s> if anything the new commission will be less attached to the tenuous relationship there is at the present time with the department of the environment <e> <s> as to the work of lamsac i do know that this is a matter of concern <e> <s> we can only decide it together with the local authorities who after all pay half the cost of lamsac anyhow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply grateful to my noble friend who quite properly reminds me that it was in fact the unanimous feeling of the advisory <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the problem generally goes beyond merely that of local government itself <e> <s> if we look carefully at the various headings that the articles cover we see that they cover a wide range of matters many of which are the responsibility of central government the nationalised industries and other bodies <e> <s> to answer in detail one would have to enumerate all that is being done and there is much that is being done because quite clearly one recognises that the problems presented by the articles are very fairly put and one should not try to get away from dealing with them <e> <s> however if the noble earl would wish me to do so i should be glad to send him the lengthy list which i have before me as to exactly what is being done to try to deal with this particular problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that one really cannot suddenly decide that all the problems of the construction industry can be laid at the door of the government <e> <s> they have been leading up to this situation for a long time <e> <s> however i think that what is perhaps noteworthy is that the latest figures for new orders for the construction industry are encouraging and they raise considerable hopes of recovery in <e> <s> total new orders for the june to august quarter are up per cent <e> <s> on the same period last year and per cent <e> <s> on the previous three months orders for private and industrial work have risen by per cent <e> <s> compared to a year earlier and by per cent <e> <s> over the previous three months commercial orders are up per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> and public orders excluding the new heathrow terminal are up per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> respectively <e> <s> there is no attempt in giving these figures to deny that the industry does have problems that are a matter of concern but i hope at the same time that it will be felt that the figures that i have just given are encouraging <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for his assistance in the matter and i entirely concur with everything he says <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly bear in mind the last point that the noble lord has made <e> <s> as to his earlier comments i thought that he was about to give me something of a lesson and was willingly looking forward to learning something new as i do each day <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure how far that question in fact relates to the original question <e> <s> however i think i know what the noble lord means <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend repeat the question if he would not mind <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend repeat the question <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may now join in i have been waiting to do so for a while <e> <s> the noble baroness said at the beginning that she thought i was not in my usual affable mood <e> <s> perhaps some subjects make us a little more or less affable than others <e> <s> may i begin by saying that frankly the whole point of what this is all about is being missed <e> <s> the whole point is about accommodation being available <e> <s> this is what we said right at the beginning when we introduced shortholds <e> <s> and may i remind the noble baroness that the opposition to shorthold which was shown by the labour party when we first brought it in was as fierce as it is today and it was no less fierce before or after we proposed the introduction of this particular measure about registering the rent initially <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness is now saying that neither does she i am absolutely delighted to hear her say so and i hope she will tell her friends in another place that she does not approve of what they are saying <e> <s> as to the point about students they will be in the same position as any other tenant with the same right to apply to rent officers <e> <s> i take note and not without some appreciation of what was said about the fact that they will be reluctant to go along afterwards <e> <s> that is a point of view <e> <s> i am not sure that i agree with it but i recognise and understand it <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i do not take that point at all <e> <s> the noble lord is referring to some kind of accommodation <e> <s> we are saying that there is in this country a vast area of accommodation that could be made available for short-term lettings if only the landlords were able to be sure of getting it back <e> <s> that is what shorthold is <e> <s> some would go even further like the noble lord lord monson who said that if it were not for the fair rents that will still have to apply there would be a whole flood of accommodation becoming available <e> <s> that is quite possible but it is another issue entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords the real answer is twofold <e> <s> first the fact that we have it in the bill and that we retain the right to do what we are doing by this order shows quite clearly that there is no stop and start begin and end <e> <s> the fact that at the time we did that we were endeavouring to do what we could to be helpful and to give the maximum encouragement to people is one thing <e> <s> at the same time we made the alternative quite clear and have done all along if we saw that shorthold was failing <e> <s> but i am not saying that it is by any means because some would say that or so far is very good <e> <s> there are now families in accommodation that they would not have had were it not for shorthold <e> <s> so how far one can say whether or not it is succeeding is one thing but in my view the number is disappointing so far <e> <s> this is because of what the labour party are saying to the landlords <e> <s> we are not alone in our view <e> <s> we are told by the landlords associations that this is so <e> <s> we have to listen to what they say and we have to be willing to do anything we can within the powers which the act gives us to improve the situation <e> <s> this is what we are doing and that is why we are doing it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill and the noble viscount lord thurso for commenting on the statement and i shall try to answer their remarks <e> <s> first the issue of there not <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the question of by-passes i think that the noble lord lord walston will obtain some useful information when he has a chance to look at the white paper itself <e> <s> perhaps i ought to state for the record that already this year new starts are being made on by-passes <e> <s> in addition the white paper announces four more new by-passes and it announces also the bringing forward of yet more from the previous programme in other words a phasing forward <e> <s> i think that that would illustrate that in so far as is at all possible the government are concerned to step up work of this kind within the resources available <e> <s> i think that it indicates that priority is being given to the point that the noble lord makes and i hope that he will be pleased about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what my noble friend lord glenkinglas says about that point and i think that it only illustrates the difficulty facing anyone who is trying to take on board all the problems mentioned in the statement <e> <s> there are complex and intractable problems in trying to find a balance a way through <e> <s> i am sure that there is much sympathy for what my noble friend says <e> <s> however <e> <s> i hope that he will find helpful what we are proposing <e> <s> it is not intended to increase at all the size of the lorries as such but rather to find a way to achieve greater capacity within vehicles of the same size without damaging road surfaces and foundations <e> <s> perhaps that will not completely satisfy my noble friend since he might like to see more by-passes and other solutions to the problem of narrow roads <e> <s> if he has any suggestions i would point out that the white paper is intended for consultation and we should be very glad to hear them <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the intention and clearly this too is part of the discussion that must go forward is to keep down speeds <e> <s> i understand that a particular speed limit is at present being considered <e> <s> i do not have details of it but i will gladly write to the noble baroness with that information <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that what was said in the statement and what the white paper brings out would indicate that we are very conscious of the point that the noble lord makes as indeed we are of what i may call all the other environmental aspects of the matter <e> <s> i ask your lordships to await the details as to how the objective will be achieved through having greater capacity without the vehicles having to be bigger or being likely to cause more vibration <e> <s> indeed they will be less so due to the fact that the lorries will be constructed with an extra axle as suggested <e> <s> i think that the noble lord will be satisfied on that point <e> <s> in view of the questions that are coming from different parts of your lordships house i feel that there is a need to look at the matter in more detail to see exactly how it is proposed we should move in the desired direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had made the point that one of the great complaints from the industry is not that they have to overload but that they have to underload if i may use the term <e> <s> i am assured that one of the objects of the exercise through increasing in terms of tonnes the weight that vehicles will carry using an extra axle yet without the vehicles being larger than at present is to carry an additional amount thus resulting in extra efficiency and economy without the necessity for vehicles to be of the heavier type that was previously considered <e> <s> it is interesting to note that the eec which previously had a limit of tonnes is now coming down to the tonnes limit that we are proposing in the white paper <e> <s> if my noble friend lord swinfen wishes to pursue further that particular point with me i should be glad to do so with him outside the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not make any observations on the political point which the noble baroness made about housing generally <e> <s> we are here today dealing with this particular statement <e> <s> the noble baroness has said that there is only four months in it and she quoted some figures to illustrate that the issuing of notices had gone up to a month <e> <s> the fact is that since september when norwich agreed to increase their rate of issue of section notices from a month to a month they have made no more than marginal adjustments to their projected timetable <e> <s> to put that figure of per month into context let me point out that one labour controlled authority a metropolitan district issued over section notices in october alone more than norwichs total case load <e> <s> it is not a question of why pick on norwich <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> i certainly do assure him and the house that there are many other cases that the government are watching and discussing carefully and have been and will continue to do so <e> <s> if any of your lordships has any specific other cases which you <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say is that so many other authorities have not found it impossible to act within the time limits <e> <s> i think that that is really the relevant answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the noble baroness perhaps more than most of your lordships would have known that many such authorities have been selling council houses for a long time now <e> <s> they did not wait for right to buy procedures to compel them so to do and they are continuing to do so <e> <s> they of course do not come within this because i understand that in one case which the noble baroness has mentioned they have sold per cent <e> <s> against all requests that they have received <e> <s> so today my concern is not to go into the detail of other authorities <e> <s> i repeat if the noble baroness has any particular one she wishes me to take up i shall be glad to do so and to come back to her when she does so <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly be glad to do anything i can to ensure that the noble baroness has any statistics and information that we have <e> <s> they will be fully available to her <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no reason to think otherwise <e> <s> the attitude adopted by the banks has been encouraging <e> <s> a good deal of the early success of the scheme must be as a result of their efforts <e> <s> however there is still work to do in ensuring that the banks at all levels especially local branches appreciate what the scheme can offer <e>", "<cs> my lords as the comedian said i am glad you asked me that <e> <s> i asked the same question <e> <s> noble lords might like to know that regarding a small business my brief says <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to advise my noble friend that because of the success of the scheme an additional amount of million has already been made available making million in all <e> <s> clearly this is one of those very encouraging features of a new development which we are all very happy to see <e>", "<cs> my lords there would always be failures in any case <e> <s> if we were to stop and not do this because of that consideration then we would do nothing and that can hardly be the right answer <e> <s> there are other facilities available for equity finance <e> <s> the business start-up scheme is where people have to go for that <e> <s> secondly the rates being charged are not exorbitant they are coming out at very much the equivalent to what borrowers of that kind would normally pay <e> <s> i think the fact that there is such an encouraging take-up is something we should welcome rather than regret <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i was more pleased to hear what the noble lord lord evans said in response to the statement than what was said by the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> i do not know what one has to do to make a statement which will please the noble baroness <e> <s> we cannot win them all <e> <s> it is all right so long as we win some <e> <s> she said it was more a catalogue of good intentions than of action <e> <s> those who will be receiving the extra million i hope may feel that it was more action than a statement of intention <e> <s> there is this additional money <e> <s> i should have thought it would have been well received by everyone <e> <s> i can tell the noble baroness from my own experience and i chair all the programme authorities and four out of the six partnership authorities that they will welcome the extra resources and will consider them more action than intention <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking here of constant prices <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as a u-turn goes i do not think that is relevant to what we are talking about <e> <s> one always seeks to use resources as best one can and because we have decided we should make allocations in this way i do not in any way consider that a u-turn not that a u-turn necessarily has to be of itself something one should never do despite whatever happens <e> <s> that is a personal view <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the secretary of state for scotland is fully in the picture as to what we are doing as detailed in this statement but this statement applies to england and not to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right to refer to what is a very great problem for some areas <e> <s> i have been round many of them not just in wales but places like walsall parts of manchester and so on <e> <s> it is a very real problem <e> <s> but we have to <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the noble baroness is slightly pulling my leg here in that she wants me to say that there is very little that is constant <e> <s> if that is so then i accept that leg pulling in very good grace <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is talking of two separate matters <e> <s> in my response to the point that he made i was trying to make a generalisation because i felt that was how the original question was put to me on the whole area of current spending and capital spending <e> <s> the figure i gave i said some per cent <e> <s> reduction for capital spending in recent years is absolutely relevant too <e> <s> the point of current expenditure is that that is about how many people you employ and what programmes you put forward on a day-to-day basis whereas the capital programme is something that need not necessarily involve that <e> <s> it does to some extent but not in maintenance <e> <s> with respect the two matters are separate although they come together at the end in total spending <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i am not able to answer the noble baroness as to that <e> <s> i will get the information for her <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the rent assessment committees england and wales amendment regulations laid before the house on th november be approved <e> <s> these regulations are concerned with the procedures followed by rent assessment committees <e> <s> committees are drawn from regional rent assessment panels and their task is to fix fair rents in those cases where either landlord or tenant has objected to the fair rent registered by the rent officer <e> <s> the regulations do not in any way affect the independence of rent assessment committees from central government nor affect the basis of assessment of fair rents <e> <s> their objective is to streamline procedures and to reduce delays without prejudicing the rights of either landlords or tenants <e> <s> the proposals flow from the recommendations of the working party on rent assessment panel procedures whose report was placed in the library on th november <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try if i can to answer the points that the noble baroness has made but i would preface my remarks by saying that of course the observations made by the council on tribunals an important and knowledgeable body were considered very carefully in this respect as indeed was the report of the working party which i am sure the noble baroness would agree with me consisted of some extremely knowledgeable people in this field <e> <s> it was a question at the end of the day of striking a balance not always the easiest thing to do <e> <s> i understand when the noble baroness says she is not happy about the reducton in the time but perhaps i should explain first why it is she asked me the question that we seem to have as she said gone back on what was put into the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that <e> <s> yes i will give an undertaking <e> <s> i am extremely interested as it happens in this particular field <e> <s> yes i will do that and i will communicate with the noble baroness <e> <s> we will look at them together when they come out <e>", "<cs> my lords on these latter points i do not think that the noble baroness is suggesting that should now give details of the methods of assessment <e> <s> i think she is asking whether we will take steps to make it clear what the methods of assessment are at the time <e> <s> as to that and on the earlier point i will think about what she says <e> <s> how far it is practical i am not sure <e> <s> we will read what she says and look at the points <e> <s> we are anxious to avoid anything that will cause delay <e> <s> one of the two objects of this exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and the noble baroness lady seear for their support <e> <s> i appreciate their reluctance in some ways <e> <s> nevertheless i think i understand why <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington referred to this as a reversal of the policy of non-intervention <e> <s> i do not think anybody would quarrel with the statement that the private sector of the steel industry faces very special difficulties in as much as it competes both with a subsidised european industry and also with the british steel corporation which is substantially supported by the taxpayer <e> <s> it is true to say that this applies to no other industry in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords at this time i certainly cannot give the noble lord that information <e> <s> i will be glad to write to him with that information so far as it is available <e> <s> i suspect however that it is not readily available as such because i would imagine that the general policy of assisting in the way that is being done in other countries and which we are now trying to follow is something which they have done for a while <e> <s> but i would say again that they do not have the situation which we have here where their taxpayers subsidise a nationalised sector of an industry in competition with the private sector <e> <s> i do not believe that it will not be easy to draw exact comparisons but if the noble lord would like me to do so i would be very glad to give him such additional statistical information as i can obtain <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that what the noble viscount refers to as adversary politics is connected with it at all <e> <s> the fact is that a government of a certain complexion set out to follow a policy which they believe the right way to help the industry concerned <e> <s> if events prove to be that in the opinion of a successive government that is not the right way then they will follow their policy <e> <s> but i do not think that it is a matter of adversary politics as described by the noble lord at all <e> <s> the fact that this situation applies all over europe means that one simply cannot say this is brought about by one government or another because one would then have to go to all <e>", "<cs> my lords to give chapter and verse on each of the items i mentioned would perhaps push question time too far <e> <s> however i take the point that my noble friend makes <e> <s> simplicity must of course be at all times as paramount as indeed the sheer quantum to which my noble friend refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that to have done that would have been to court disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that and i sympathise very much indeed with my noble friend <e> <s> i can only hope that his having raised the matter today will ensure that it is brought to the notice of those concerned <e> <s> who knows <e> <s> it may have some beneficial impact as a result thereof <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of what is being done in italy <e> <s> certainly we are very seized indeed of this whole matter of forms and circulars and the impositions upon small businesses indeed in many other areas <e> <s> therefore again i shall note what the noble lord says and if there is anything to be learnt we shall be glad to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords it has to be said that if the governments requests to local government had resulted in the reduction of expenditure which we have felt so necessary the burden of rates would not have been as great as the noble lord mentions <e> <s> however this is an ongoing situation with which we are concerned the whole time <e> <s> indeed forthcoming legislation as well as other measures will hopefully contribute towards doing the very thing that i am sure the noble lord wishes to see <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be for the assistance of the house if i were to make it clear that these two schemes are quite independent of each other <e> <s> it is too soon to draw conclusions about the overall impact of both schemes but the early indications are encouraging <e> <s> ten of enterprise zones have been designated since june and a wide range of development is under way in them including the establishment of a number of entirely new companies <e> <s> the loan guarantee scheme also came into operation in june and in its first six months of operation as i reported only the other day to your lordships guarantees have been issued in respect of million of bank lending <e> <s> this includes million of lending to new businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter of publicity is one that constantly concerns us <e> <s> i think it is perhaps a little soon at the moment to do this on a major scale <e> <s> we are monitoring very carefully what is happening <e> <s> we are anxious not to give any wrong impressions at all but i am sure that when the time hopefully not too far ahead comes when we are in a position to produce a list of what is being achieved my noble friend and indeed all members of your lordships house who i know are anxious that we should succeed in this will be pleased with what is taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the noble lord will have to give me the details of the specific instance so that i can have a look at it <e> <s> but i would say that that is not something that is impossible <e> <s> if it was an odd case then it would not be of great significance certainly not when measured against the totality of what we are hoping to achieve with this scheme <e> <s> but in the main the record so far of what is happening is very encouraging and i think would far outweigh the kind of hopefully individual situation to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the helpful way in which he puts his question <e> <s> i gladly undertake that we shall do just as he says <e> <s> the important thing however is not to do so too soon nor to give any wrong impression <e> <s> it is not a question of scoring points or wanting to show things that have not been achieved <e> <s> i think everyone is interested in what the scheme genuinely can do and be seen to do and i am sure that in due course we shall be able to come back with that information <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks a fair question how due is due course <e> <s> clearly at this moment in time i cannot tell him but he can be quite sure that if the scheme achieves all or the greater part of what we hope then the case for extension will presumably be overwhelming <e> <s> however i think we have to see it really proved further than is the case at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement that is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not surprise me that the noble baroness was disappointed at the tone of the statement <e> <s> i have yet to make a statement which has not disappointed the noble baroness <e> <s> but who knows <e> <s> perhaps i shall one day <e> <s> the noble baroness said that the bill was changed because of pressure <e> <s> if listening to what is said and reacting to peoples feelings is pressure she is quite right <e> <s> i do not think many noble lords would quarrel too much with it having been done in that way <e> <s> the secretary of state made it quite clear that he was willing to listen to alternative ways of achieving the same objective so i hope we shall not be too critical of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that <e> <s> it is what people do that matters <e> <s> there is sufficient evidence to show that while some authorities are very prudent and are having to manage very tightly and very carefully there are others who could not care less and who indeed have embarked deliberately and openly on a policy of frustrating central government policy by employing people <e> <s> if you look at some of the activities for which those authorities employ them i could reel off a whole string it is a matter of shame <e>", "<cs> my lords i make no general observations about the comments which have been made by the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> i think they speak for themselves and no doubt will be read for themselves <e> <s> as to his request for information about when the procedure will come into effect clearly it has now to be put through but we are hoping for the beginning of the municipal year <e> <s> that means at the end of march and the beginning of april <e> <s> i do not think that i can help the noble lord further with anything else he said <e> <s> i know of his interest and i know of his considerable experience in that field <e> <s> i respect that and i hope that when we come to debate the nuts and bolts if i may call it that he will make a contribution and i shall look forward to hearing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for making a point that perhaps i should have made <e> <s> i see so many representations to our department of the impact of high rates and only this week i had two letters that were really quite heartbreaking about firms which had moved out of inner london areas and taken their employment with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not about to bandy words with the noble lord lord davies of leek on the agricultural scene <e> <s> i am sure that he has far greater knowledge of it than i have <e> <s> but when he talks about the streets not being gritted or whatever this is of course a priority for each authority <e> <s> some may think it a very strange priority that some authorities claim not to be able to do so while at the same time they do feel able to subsidise their fares to the tune of over million a year as i know one local authority does <e> <s> it subsidises bus fares to the tune of over million a year and i hope that that authority is not saying that it does not have the funds to grit the streets <e>", "<cs> my lords to go into the management structures of local authorities one would have to debate all that came at the time of reorganisation <e> <s> there is no doubt that different local authorities have different management rgimes and perhaps that is not a bad thing <e> <s> i have my own view as to the best way of doing it <e> <s> but if we are also committed as i think we are despite what was said a moment ago to allowing local authorities to do their own thing they will manage their affairs in different ways and some would criticise many of them for the way they do it <e> <s> it is part of the whole problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for pointing out the need to be careful <e> <s> i would only repeat what i was saying earlier that it is not something that is new <e> <s> the noble baroness said that much of what is in the paper she understands is what layfield had said <e> <s> that is quite true but it puts the implications in much greater detail <e> <s> but the whole subject is not new <e> <s> we have had many representations already <e> <s> i do not think we should hang around if i may use that expression <e> <s> i do not think anyone would want us to do that for longer than need be <e> <s> i cannot give the house a timetable as to what will follow from that <e> <s> it will depend upon what is decided <e> <s> but i repeat that we understand the urgency of something being done without any more delay than is absolutely necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords in fact the glc has very little role in this matter now other than in regard to certain planning aspects of it <e> <s> the reason why this particular zone is behind the others is that it had to be part of the urban development corporation the london docklands development corporation which in fact is the enterprise zone authority and they had to go through the timescale of the select committee in your lordships house which took some days and then there were other statutory requirements before they could proceed <e> <s> indeed a certain amount of statutory form is still going on and that is basically the reason for the delay <e> <s> but in answer to my noble friend i should not have thought that the glc whatever its views may be is in fact in a position really to do anything that would hinder or delay what is planned to be done within the zone <e>", "<cs> my lords was it only yesterday that i covered the same point <e> <s> i think it was the noble lord lord underhill who raised it <e> <s> i said then and repeat again that there may well be cases such as the noble lord has mentioned but i would hope they would be very few in relation to the other benefits that will flow from the establishment of the zones <e> <s> just as yesterday i was slightly reluctant to reel off a list of what might be terms the goodies and some of them are impressive as to what is happening within the zones i feel it would be better to wait a little while until we can see a clearer picture <e> <s> so conversely i would be reluctant to comment on the extent if any well there is a little we know but i do not think it is significant of the action that the noble lord refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what the impact on the exchequer would be of that concession in terms of rates <e> <s> i think if i may make a serious point on what the noble lord says there are building up now some very interesting and hopefully i think your lordships will all ultimately agree considerable success stories within the zones <e> <s> but it is too soon and i do not want to say much more about it at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his helpful comment <e> <s> i think that that is absolutely right <e> <s> there is great enthusiasm <e> <s> indeed your lordships may recall the noble lord lord northfield yesterday pressing me to say when we might be considering one for the area in which he is interested but we have to wait and see <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understand my noble friend aright i think that the answer is yes but again we shall have to be very careful <e> <s> i think i said also yesterday that we are having a special monitoring <e> <s> a special survey of this is being set up so that we can assess the situation carefully because before we consider any extension or anything else quite apart from all the financial implications which are quite considerable we have to be absolutely certain that the benefits are on the scale that we hope for <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not want at this stage to give any figures of jobs created <e> <s> i think it is too early to do so <e> <s> i have some information which is interesting but would rather wait for it to be confirmed <e> <s> therefore i would ask my noble friend to excuse me from being too specific on that point <e> <s> my noble friends other point about interchange of experiences and ideas is important <e> <s> it is something that is happening at the present time and i think will happen much more as experience within the zones builds up <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for their observations on the statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill asked whether the discussions to which i referred will result in some subsidies which would help to meet deficiencies <e> <s> he also referred to the need for wider legislation <e> <s> i think that these and the other questions he asked have to be borne in mind against the background of what caused the situation in the first place and the fact is that as a result of the policies that the new glc administration if i can call it that imposed the increase to london ratepayers including the loss of grant was times i repeat times what the cost was before <e> <s> quite clearly there were tremendous burdens upon those ratepayers and <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect it is not the governments decision which is creating chaos it is the glcs decision that created chaos where previously it did not exist <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole problem is this what is a reasonable level of subsidy <e> <s> of course it is not unreasonable that there should be a subsidy <e> <s> other capital cities help with subsidies and there is no suggestion that there should not be a subsidy in the case of london transport <e> <s> the whole issue is what should be that level of subsidy how should it equate and as i said before how should it balance between the ratepayers the taxpayers and the users of the transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in no position any more than with respect is i think the noble lord to pass an opinion upon the opinions of the lawyers who gave advice to the glc or indeed with great respect upon those who gave a contrary view and i certainly do not intend today to embark upon that <e> <s> when the noble lord says that the fares fair policy was satisfactory he means from his point of view and from the point of view of those who feel likewise <e> <s> i can assure him that it was very unsatisfactory from the point of view of many other people and i think he would agree to that <e> <s> i am pleased to say and i am glad that the noble lord raised the point that the pensioners do not have any need to he concerned that their interests are and will be taken care of <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord would concede very quickly that he asked me a very great number of questions which i tried like mad if i may put it in that way to write down <e> <s> if i did not cover them all i apologise to him <e> <s> i know that he will understand he always does <e> <s> he asked what is the right rate of subsidy <e> <s> what is a reasonable level <e> <s> how do you retain a balance <e> <s> i cannot tell him today what is the right level <e> <s> that will depend i assume upon how one defines a fair and reasonable balance <e> <s> what i do know is that the law lords felt that the existing level was certainly not the right level <e> <s> one would have to read the judgment very closely as i have done and as i am sure the noble lord has done and i would respectfully suggest to read it more than once to decide what view one would take as an individual <e> <s> however at the end of the day of course it is for the glc themselves to decide in the light of the ruling in the light of their interpretation of what was said in the judgment and <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to their individual hip allocations authorities may use their capital receipts as they wish <e> <s> the exact amount is not known but it is at least some million in which is a very considerable sum and i think should enable authorities to do a great deal in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords in no way did i give a misleading impression <e> <s> the question asked what the government were doing to help private sector building and i gave a list relating to exactly that <e> <s> i made no observation as to whether the level of housebuilding was satisfactory or otherwise <e> <s> it was not my intention to do so <e> <s> but when the noble lord asks about and stresses his concern at the general level of house building and that is what he meant when he referred to the public sector although this question is specifically directed to the private sector of housing i must tell him that the other figures which i gave in response to the supplementary asked by my noble friend are also not without significance <e> <s> there is now the scope for local authorities perhaps in ways not generally applicable in recent times to have sufficient monies to do what they want in terms of building if they decide that that is their priority <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will surely know that i am not in a position to say that <e> <s> the bulk of it of course comes from the sales of council houses and clearly the individual calculations will depend upon many factors such as the original cost the level of debt that it reduces and so on <e> <s> many factors are involved and the noble lord knows that i cannot give him that information <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have that figure readily to hand but i will gladly write to my noble friend about it <e> <s> the fact is that there is an upward trend and one would want to see it at a higher level <e> <s> but we must bear in mind that there has been a big change in the whole housing scene <e> <s> there is today a much greater emphasis on for example renovation and rehabilitation than there was previously <e> <s> this cannot be left out of the whole debate on housing <e> <s> the noble lord opposite referred to the question of waiting lists <e> <s> i think that that is another debate entirely and one would want to look very carefully at those before coming to conclusions about them <e>", "<cs> my lords i revert to what i originally said when answering the question <e> <s> the fact is that the level of starts has increased and that must surely be satisfactory or if not satisfactory at least encouraging to those who are interested in seeing more private sector building <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that the private sector builds more or less is not in any way a matter which makes more or less the building of public accommodation <e> <s> the two are not related except in so far as in the past many local authorities and public bodies held on to land and did not release land which made it impossible for the private sector to build as they would have liked to do <e> <s> but the level of public sector building is a matter for the authorities themselves to decide and that they will do <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that really calls for a reply but one ought to say in the context of the whole of housing that the position generally is not the same as it was <e> <s> there is in fact a crude surplus of housing as such and one of the great problems that concern those who are involved with this subject relates to many other factors such as the level of housing and the kind of housing that should be built <e> <s> i think that if local authorities were to concentrate on one- and two-bedroomed units thereby enabling many who live in three-bedroomed accommodation to go into those units that too would affect public housing <e> <s> many factors are involved <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by saying that i too endorse what has been said by others in thanking the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for bringing forward this matter today <e> <s> we do indeed owe him a debt of gratitude for that <e> <s> may i also thank my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for his important and helpful contribution <e> <s> i am very grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lord lord mishcon should deduce from what i have said that that is the governments attitude <e> <s> as i have tried to indicate apparently not successfully to the noble lord we are concerned about all aspects of the pearson report <e> <s> because we do not at the moment agree with everything that is contained within it since we find that it is not possible immediately to deal with all aspects of it this does not mean that the government disagree with the report <e> <s> should there be any particular point relating to the matter which the noble lord has raised which we ought to consider further then as with all the other observations which have been made i gladly confirm that we shall study it very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords if by taking any action on the pearson report or for that matter on any other report one could reduce road accidents in the way that the noble lord and everybody else would like that would be another matter <e> <s> i can only say to the noble lord that we appreciate the importance of action but always there are those who have to take decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the function of those directly concerned with individual research projects to monitor their effectiveness and what they are achieving but i hope my noble friend will know i am sure he does of the role of the british technology group <e> <s> the national research development corporation and the national enterprise board working together under this new title the british technology group have particular responsibilities to exploit and market the results of publicly-funded research from universities and government laboratories and to keep an eye on this part of the scheme <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend would like to know that the total amount of money spent on research in this way is of course very much more than the figure i have given but i rather directed my answer towards that spent specifically on industrial research <e> <s> but if my noble friend would like a more detailed breakdown of the totality of what is being spent i will try to get it for him <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with that and that is why it is so critically important that industry be in a position where it can make its profits and therefore plough back more resources into research <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord will be glad to know that in fact the expenditure by the research councils which finance much of the research activity in universities is being maintained at broadly the current levels throughout the period up to and that indeed the five research councils will spend a total of million in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble baroness that the figures i have given are the correct figures <e> <s> the way in which the funds are apportioned is of course up to the universities themselves to decide but in the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a very fair point <e> <s> i cannot comment upon it here but certainly i will discuss it with those concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is no the minister is not aware correction the minister was not aware he is now aware <e>", "<cs> my lords one obviously has sympathy with those who did pay in reply to the original request <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who did not pay originally i understand exactly what the noble baroness is saying but i am sure she would hardly expect me to endorse her proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had made it clear that in fact the london boroughs association have suggested that if anyone requests a refund they will make it <e> <s> it is my information that they are in fact doing that <e> <s> but of course we are now in february the year ends at the end of march and therefore the new demand will be due on st april <e> <s> therefore one can see why those who take that line perhaps prefer not to make the repayment unless it is specifically requested <e> <s> if it is then as my noble friend so rightly says they are entitled to refund it and my information is that they are willing to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the point the noble lord raises is a fair point <e> <s> we are very aware of the difficulties which have been thrown up by this case <e> <s> we are at the moment actively considering whether the current law needs to be amended but at this moment in time it is too early for me to say what if any action will be taken <e> <s> but the point is very much on the table <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be reasonable in fairness to the authorities to say this is a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the first part of what he said because i do know that a number of local authorities have worked out that it would be very costly and that is why they have been hesitant <e> <s> i think the noble lords question highlights once more that this is an area that requires further clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear i am not able to help my noble friend on that <e> <s> i suspect that he did not really think that i could <e>", "<cs> my lords we start to move into a whole new area when we start to discuss the reasonableness and all that goes with it <e> <s> with respect i would suggest that this is getting away from the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the bill before your lordships contains a number of somewhat technical financial provisions affecting our transport industries <e> <s> it is a small bill a mere five clauses and one whose purpose is to maintain the existing statutory structure of financial controls rather than to introduce new policies <e> <s> so i do not anticipate that i shall need to detain your lordships long in introducing it <e> <s> the first three clauses of the bill concern the railways and i should say straightaway that i find it especially sad that i should be introducing them on a day when the system is at a standstill and when the whole future of the railways is under attack <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought with respect to the noble lord lord wynne-jones that the proposals in the bill were anything but to do with destruction <e> <s> on the contrary the size of some of the figures on which i might have expected some of your lordships to comment is huge indeed and hardly indicates the kind of message to which he referred <e> <s> however let me hasten to assure him that it was indeed the pla and not the plo to which i was referring had it been the plo i should have said different things <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be glad to discuss it with him afterwards <e> <s> the recent green paper is a preliminary to putting the governments commitment into effect <e> <s> the green paper has quite understandably been greeted in some quarters with the comment that it goes over ground which has already been well ploughed by layfield and by earlier inquiries come to that <e> <s> but my lords the green paper does not lay claim to the layfield reports breadth or depth in considering local government finance <e> <s> it perhaps adds one candidate poll tax to the layfield range of serious possibilities for alternative local taxes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady david professed her support for the bill but i must admit that she could have fooled me at times although i believe i grasped the underlying gist of what she was saying <e> <s> i shall do the best i can to respond to some of the points she made <e> <s> first the noble baroness asked me to assure her that in the matter of the disposal of assets sales were not being made that were unwise <e> <s> assurances were given in that no sales would be made against the best professional advice and this still holds good <e> <s> that is the position <e> <s> i understand the philosophical difference between the parties in their attitudes towards the sale of assets and i suppose one would simply have to agree to disagree to that <e> <s> so far as the government are concerned we are satisfied not only that this is right but as i said when introducing the bill it is enabling the government to give the kind of support needed to allow new towns to do much of what they are wanting to do <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the argument which is always given because there is little doubt that if one waits long enough inflation being what it is the chances are that one would get more <e> <s> but what really matters surely is what one does with the money one gets for the sales and how one disposes of that money <e> <s> if that money can be used in one way or another to regenerate additional assets or to make greater savings then that is a complete answer to the argument that one should not sell now but should wait until later <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness to repeat the question so that i may answer her in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord northfield will allow me i should like to respond quickly to the last comments made <e> <s> i think it would be unfortuuate if the mass of things that the government are doing to help small businesses something to <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that is so but as i said the proposal is for a consultation paper and i am quite sure the noble lord will make his observations known <e> <s> i assure him also that his observations will be studied very carefully in the light of his great experience in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords these are the proposals <e> <s> they are coming forward in the form of a consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe there is provision in the schedule for objection and i will cover that point before i sit down if i may <e> <s> there is provision for objection to sex shops applications for licences <e> <s> the local authority will take the content of these fully into account in considering whether to grant a licence <e> <s> there is no need for explicit grounds for refusal or the grounds that people object <e> <s> there is no reason why a local authority should not come to its conclusion that a sex shop is not desirable the discretion will be theirs <e> <s> that is the right they will have and unless i am missing the point very much and i do not think i am this is indeed one of the objectives of what we are proposing <e> <s> i hope that in fact will satisfy the point made by the right reverend prelate and the noble earl lord halsbury <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain of the extent to which that can be done <e> <s> i think the answer is yes providing they take into account the particular circumstances of their own area but it may well be that this is something i shall have to make more clear than i am doing at the moment <e> <s> i will certainly write to those who have raised the point and also to any others of your lordships who may feel it is somewhat obscure <e> <s> certainly it is important that it should be made clear <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware the answer to that last point is yes that is my understanding of it <e> <s> should that not be so then i will make it clear but that is my understanding of the matter <e> <s> perhaps i may now turn to another point which was mentioned by the noble baronesses lady birk and lady ewart-biggs when they suggested that perhaps another term permit might be used rather than the word licence <e> <s> i would respectfully suggest that this would not meet the point because it is surely wrong to think of licensing as signifying a seal of approval or as a permissive measure <e> <s> it would be wrong to introduce amendments which might seem so give credence to this view of the concept of licensing <e> <s> the term licence is a standard one which is used in virtually all the control systems embodied in this bill and it would be inconsistent to substitute in this particular case another word i was going to say for semantic reasons but i understand exactly the point which the noble baronesses are making <e> <s> i feel that for the reasons given it is something upon which we could not embark <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the powers will not come into this bill because clearly we could not delay this bill any longer <e> <s> although i entirely take the point that the response to the conclusions should also not be delayed i nevertheless have to say that those steps will not be put into this bill <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk referred to clause and was concerned about the protection of damaged buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the right reverend prelate knows that i ponder everything philosophically <e> <s> to what effect and with what result is a matter of opinion <e> <s> would that the right reverend prelate had asked me for some statistics relating to block grant or something of that kind when i could have shown some knowledge <e> <s> in the circumstances i shall have to answer by saying that i do not know the answer to the right reverend prelates question but i will certainly look into it and i understake to write to him about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the noble lord lord evans for the reasoned and as others have said moderate manner in which as always he has moved the second reading of his bill <e> <s> i know how strongly he believes in the cause of wider leasehold reform and i have debated the issue with him in this house both during the passage of what is now the housing act and again if i may remind the noble lord lord cledwyn in the debate on the question which he put down on the subject last june <e> <s> once again it is my task to explain why the government cannot accept the arguments that he has so clearly and courteously put forward <e>", "<cs> yes certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord says intriguing as it always is but i should like to continue with what i was saying <e> <s> a number of your lordships referred to the matter of valuations <e> <s> we heard from the noble lords lord cledwyn of penrhos lord davies of leek and my noble friend lord dilhorne <e> <s> freeholders would also be fighting in the battle i was not sure whether the noble lord lord davies referred to a tank battle in belsize park or a tax battle in belsize park <e> <s> i find both very intriguing <e> <s> belsize park must be a place that one should go to see <e> <s> but freeholders too have rights <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i have much sympathy with both points my noble friend makes <e> <s> on the first that is why i say we are looking to see whether the law needs to be changed in this matter this case has introduced something new and as i am sure my noble friend will appreciate one must be very careful before proceeding and i confirm that we are looking at it very carefully <e> <s> on his second point do all those people who need to know really know <e> <s> it is a fair point to make but i am not sure how one can go further in publicising the position than has been done <e> <s> nevertheless he makes a very valid point which only highlights the need for some clarification of the matter as regards the future <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raises the whole matter of what we call separate billing which in the case of the water authorities was taken on within the last couple of years <e> <s> i know that there is much sympathy for this idea but the problem lies in the expense of carrying it out offset against the benefit of the clear accountability that would then be shown if the rates were separately levied <e> <s> i have very much sympathy with the point that my noble friend is making but how far in practical terms i should want to go down that road i am not sure <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there are a number of boroughs who are paying interest <e> <s> that is a decision that they have made following the recommendation to them by the london boroughs association which has very much left it for them to deal with individually <e> <s> the question that my noble friend originally posed was whether or not payment of interest ought to be obligatory and as i have said that is something we are looking at because this is a new situation <e>", "<cs> well my lords with regard to the first point yes i do agree that those who pay promptly are at a disadvantage of course i would agree <e> <s> again as with the point put by my noble friend lord sandford there is much merit in the argument about the situation being an inducement not to pay promptly <e> <s> as i have said this is a new situation and i hope that it will not again arise in this particular way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should hardly think that the advice given which is concerned really with how the boroughs should act rather than with what action <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes a very interesting suggestion <e> <s> certainly that is not beyond the powers of local authorities and i am sure that note will be taken of what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can add anything to what i have said on this subject <e> <s> the noble viscount simply confirms that there can be hardship caused in this situation and i accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords in the period april to september local authorities and new towns in great britain sold dwellings most of these to their tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware the figure which my noble friend states is correct as regards the amount of money but the purpose of sales is not indeed to lead to the building of further houses <e> <s> indeed one of the major arguments in the whole debate that has ranged round this matter is that by selling to a sitting tenant you make neither more nor less available the house to another person because the same person continues to occupy it and therefore there is no need to build another house to replace the one you have sold <e> <s> but what authorities do with that amount of money which they now have is up to them <e> <s> they have a whole range of options in the housing field <e> <s> they can indeed build they can also repair they can maintain or they can offset a debt which is outstanding <e> <s> there are many things which they can do with the money <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble viscount is making a completely different point <e> <s> i would say <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that in my answer to the first supplementary question i had really answered the point which the noble lord lord underhill makes namely that you do not make the dwelling more or less available because you sell it to the sitting tenant <e> <s> therefore i cannot accept basically what he is saying on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are talking in total of a stock of some million dwellings <e> <s> as a percentage it is a very small percentage <e> <s> i think the noble lord would also like to know perhaps to help him on the figures that there have been certainly some applications and now as the momentum is growing and authorities are starting to process them more quickly then the number of sales will grow <e>", "<cs> my lords there has long operated what is called a voluntary consent which allows the authorities to sell if they so wish within certain parameters which were set down <e> <s> indeed peter shore when he was secretary of state also operated on this same basis <e>", "<cs> my lords the right-to-buy scheme now gives tenants a very wide option and r would have thought that there are very few limitations now that could make them feel either unable or unwilling to buy <e> <s> i think the incentives for them to do so are very great <e> <s> i do not think that is any reason why people should hesitate <e>", "<cs> my lords if do not have the information that the noble baroness requests <e> <s> i know from my own area experience that where sales were made they were made across a very broad spectrum in terms of the types of estates in a city <e> <s> t would have to update that considerably before giving the noble baroness a proper answer on that point <e> <s> as to the second point about the unemployment factor unfortunately i am not able to help with that either <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been much publicity in this field recently <e> <s> all authorities are operating the scheme they are required to do so by law <e> <s> all tenants have a legal right to buy <e> <s> the concern has been the dilatory way in which some authorities have been dealing with the matter <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that the government are in touch with all authorities where they feel that they have been going more slowly than they ought <e> <s> we are watching the situation carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say to the right reverend prelate that the concern about the situation is quite real <e> <s> indeed five ministers from different departments have been down to chatham in the last few months <e> <s> incidentally the most recent visit was made by my own secretary of state in the last week or so <e> <s> i know of the tremendous will that there is to help here <e> <s> in this instance there is a time factor which one does not always find <e> <s> bearing in mind all that is going on and taking into account the skills and other plusses if i may so describe them to which the right reverend prelate has referred while one must be cautious about saying so i think that here one would be more hopeful than is sometimes the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises one or two points <e> <s> first of all i would have thought that he would be pleased that in fact the number of ministers that i mentioned had been to chatham because it shows the concern that exists <e>", "<cs> my lords had it not been that ministers had gone in this way then it could clearly have been said that people were not interested <e> <s> with respect we cannot have it both ways <e> <s> they did not go there just to have a run round the docks they went to see what could be done by way of co-ordinating together with the local authorities and all interested parties that which has to be done <e> <s> as to the other point that the noble lord makes that is his point of view it is not mine <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> yes that is so <e> <s> indeed other things as well are being done <e> <s> i did not think that i should enumerate them now but everybody who has an interest and there are many such people is trying very hard to help here <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that a document has recently been compiled by the county council on the historic dockyard at chatham <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for raising this point because it is an area which is being looked at just now <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to that i think i can only say that here we have the situation of a run-down over a two-year period which is much longer than one would normally find <e> <s> i hope that to some extent that covers the point that the right reverend prelate makes <e> <s> beyond that clearly i could not go today <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords this was the point that the noble lord lord byers was referring to when he spoke of the enterprise agency <e> <s> i am glad of the opportunity to confirm as he did that we as a government are having very great success all round the country with these agencies <e> <s> indeed i hope that the point which my noble friend makes will be borne out as regards helping small businesses in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that in fact it is not an either/or situation that we are talking about <e> <s> if it was then that would be another matter <e> <s> the issue of whether or not the trident and the other nuclear defence projects proceed or do not proceed is one thing but this matter of the closure of the dockyard is an issue on its own and has been looked upon by the government in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear i cannot help the noble viscount with that <e>", "<cs> my lords the list of such projects is very long and to help my noble friend i should have to send him the details of the ones in lambeth <e> <s> however i am glad to confirm that there are such projects taking place there <e> <s> indeed in most of the other partnership authorities throughout the country it is very much government policy to encourage precisely that type of project in those areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not confirm the figures which the noble baroness mentioned <e> <s> certainly i am not aware of them <e> <s> if she wants to pursue the matter she can do so on another occasion <e> <s> the fact that the government have increased by some per cent <e> <s> this year the amount of money going to the urban programme which is concentrating that type of resource where it ought to be is indicative of the point which i made in answering the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to brush the point aside but the fact is that under the system as it now is rate support grant is given on the basis of assessment of need <e> <s> it so happens that the type of authorities to which the noble baroness refers and to which the first supplementary from my noble friend referred are those authorities which have benefited most from the rate support grant settlement so they are getting an advantage out of a finite sum of money which is distributed in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should need to know the specific schemes to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> i am grateful that she raises this point because one of the prime objectives of this whole exercise is to encourage or as the americans say lever private sector funds so that the total amount of resources going into these areas is many times what the government themselves are putting in <e> <s> when we have achieved that everywhere as in the case which my noble friend has mentioned one can really feel that one is making major progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord byers <e> <s> i confirm that and as the noble lord says it is one of the most encouraging developments taking place today <e>", "<cs> my lords local authorities have very wide powers under section of the local government act to arrange for the publication within their area of information relating to local government <e> <s> it is for the district auditor to consider whether in publishing the <e>", "<cs> my lords a lot of questions were asked all at the same time <e> <s> perhaps on the first point about the district auditor i can tell my noble friend that the district auditor is already aware of this view and the disquiet that is felt by many londoners about their money being used in this way <e> <s> if the district auditor considers the expenditure illegal or unreasonable it is open to him to initiate surcharge action at any time <e> <s> i am not certain about the figure to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> my information is that the cost of printing and distribution has been reported to be of the order of <e> <s> but whether that covers one issue or the years issues i do not know <e> <s> on the last point the one of principle i would certainly agree with my noble friend that it surely makes a mockery of protestations by any authority that they are short of funds to carry out essential services if they are willing to pour them away on matters of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords whether the figure is or or half a million pounds i am not aware at this moment <e> <s> if it is the figure the noble lord mentions then the ratepayers and the residents in london would find very many uses for what i consider to be a not inconsiderable amount <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite certain the point my noble friend raises is important <e> <s> the amounts of money involved there are not inconsiderable <e> <s> if it should be that the district auditor is not aware of them they will certainly be drawn to his attention for his consideration in the same way as i mentioned in regard to the other matter <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there are authorities which issue publications all over the country and have always been <e> <s> i think the thrust of the original question is the content of these types of publications <e> <s> i do not think it is good enough as the noble lord lord jenkins said simply to say that one mans meat is another mans poison that can be so unless you are having to pay the bill for your own poison <e>", "<cs> my lords some may consider this local patriotism others may consider it something else <e> <s> but i say again that the thrust of the question was whether or not this was a proper use of ratepayers money and i have tried to answer it on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords as long as money is spent in this way it is open to anyone to question whether it is a right and proper way <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i think the noble lord misses the point <e> <s> the point is that anyone may at any time refer to the district auditor anything which he or she or they may feel ought to be investigated as a matter of abuse or misuse of ratepayers money <e> <s> the district auditor will decide at the end of the day whether or not that is so <e> <s> but there is no harm in my view and indeed i think it is a great safeguard that there is someone who is independent to whom people may refer matters of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat what i have said that it is up to anyone to draw anything they wish to the attention of any district auditor <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with my noble friend on his first remarks <e> <s> as for the second part of his question i agree that there is without doubt great opportunity here if local government will look at this matter objectively and will simply compare and obtain competitive quotations <e> <s> i entirely agree that there is much scope <e>", "<cs> my lords it really is difficult to respond to a speech made in the form of a question although i appreciate the point the noble lord makes <e> <s> i think one has to recognise that this whole debate is about obtaining value for money <e> <s> this is what concerns people <e> <s> the level of services provided is in many cases of a good standard there is no argument about that <e> <s> the question is whether all the services can be afforded in the way in which they are now provided <e> <s> are they being provided in the most efficient way <e> <s> that was the thrust of my noble friends point which i think was a very fair one and ought properly to be made <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not agree at all <e> <s> there is no way of making comparison we are not comparing like with like <e> <s> local government does not have to deal with national matters such as defence <e> <s> the only fair way in which one might draw comparison is by looking at the reduction in manpower since this government came into office and since local government started to react to the governments request <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble baroness the fact is that if there is either inefficiency or over-manning and nobody that i know in local government denies that there is much of that people are simply paying for something that they are not getting <e> <s> the long-term effect of that is what we are seeing today people are saying that enough is enough and they will not stand for it <e> <s> that has a disadvantageous effect on the private sector who at the end of the day have to provide the real jobs and the real wealth that produces the money for all the other employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have thought that any authority really concerned about the streets being cleaned and the need to make reductions should go and look at places which have taken on the services of the private sector like southend and see the improvement in standards there for a dramatic decrease in cost <e>", "<cs> my lords the non-domestic rate burden in greater london rose from billion in to billion in disregarding the supplementary rate issued by the glc <e> <s> the year-on-year increase in rate burden includes a gain in rateable value of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen the expressed concern of the london borough labour leaders and of course i share that concern with them as i do with my noble friend who asked the question <e> <s> as to what the effects of this will be i would refer my noble friend to a survey carried out at the beginning of december by the london chamber of commerce which was quite dramatic in its answer to those who said that increases of this kind in rates to the non-domestic sector is of little consequence in so far as it affects jobs <e> <s> it affects jobs and employment very much indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this is a very short bill but nevertheless an important one <e> <s> it gives the greater london council power to pay for travel concessions for elderly and disabled people <e> <s> the glc is the only authority which does not have specific power for that purpose <e> <s> county and district councils outside london were given this power under section of the transport act <e> <s> it was extended to london boroughs by section of the transport london act but not to the glc <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not accept that at all <e> <s> the fact is that there was no turmoil there was no problem of this kind in any way before the glc made the decision which necessitated a reference to the law lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i fail to appreciate how when faced with the kind of politicisation if there be such a word that we are faced wtih in this matter the government and least of all i can be accused of becoming involved in political attempts to raise the temperature and i think that was the implification of what noble lords opposite have said <e> <s> let me try to get this back on course <e> <s> one of the clear difficulties in dealing with subsidies for transport is that they can get out of hand <e> <s> london transport expect to have direct running costs of over million next year <e> <s> it is very easy for subsidies to escalate rapidly when costs go up even without cutting fares <e> <s> when control of a local authority changes hands it may be tempting for a new council to make a dramatic shift in policy and to increase expenditure very sharply much more quickly than would be possible with a service like education <e> <s> that was the experience that faced the last labour government <e> <s> i will not hold up your lordships by going into that <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather think that that is coming it a bit <e> <s> if i had been in my former incarnation i would have answered the noble lord more vigorously than i am expected to in this house <e> <s> if we want to get it on the level he speaks about let me make three other quotations from the law lords and this is really the nub of what the noble lords opposite have said about this matter of the criteria the fiduciary duty <e> <s> lord justice oliver said that the fiduciary duty was owed <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly what i was trying to do in what i was saying <e> <s> i was in no way trying to belittle the difficulty of coming to that conclusion <e> <s> but as the courts would say about everything what is reasonable <e> <s> what is the burden that the taxpayer the ratepayer and the traveller should pay <e> <s> if you come to a conclusion which is patently reasonable to everyone then i would have thought that was the criteria <e> <s> beyond that no one can go <e>", "<cs> the options are open my lords <e> <s> there should be no service which is not compared so as to see what the private sector can provide by way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the instance to which the noble baroness refers <e> <s> however i cannot get away from the basic premise that it cannot be wrong to obtain competitive tenders for anything <e> <s> i should have thought that any local authority which is really concerned about value for money would always want and many of them are now doing it to obtain tenders from whatever source and should it prove that they are not as competitive as their own workforce then that is fine but at least everybody should want to know <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in many ways in relatively early days on this matter <e> <s> there is now such a significant movement in this direction that to attempt to compile statistics at this time might be self-defeating <e> <s> nevertheless the point made by my noble friend is absolutely correct basically and i assure him that we shall continue to watch matters very carefully <e> <s> i can tell him for example that in the case of one service alone i know of more than authorities which are at present looking into the possibility of provision by the private sector <e> <s> that indicates the extent to which the trend is growing but i certainly take the basic thrust of what my noble friend said <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that i had suggested that the removal of refuse was the only service <e> <s> on the contrary i suggested that all services should be looked at <e> <s> if however as the noble lord lord shinwell suggests it should prove to be the case that all services can more competitively be provided by the private sector then what greater incentive could there be for an authority which is responsible for giving to its electorate that for which it was elected in the first place namely a proper level of service provided at a proper and most advantageous level of cost <e>", "<cs> my lords from all the information available to me i gladly so confirm and i am glad my noble friend referred not just to the level of savings substantial though they are but also to the standards of service because that too is a very important factor <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is referring to the subject of waste disposal and i know he is aware that the private sector has worked together with the public sector for many years in providing that service and of course the basic point he makes is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords not at any time despite my answer to the noble lord lord shinwell would i say that every aspect of every service necessarily lends itself to the involvement of the private sector <e> <s> it is a matter as always of common sense in deciding what is the right thing to do <e> <s> but then unfortunately we do not always get that prevailing do we <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble lord lord bruce of donington well knows such information as we have is always available to anyone who requests it <e> <s> i consider that in this particular case the answer i gave was a fair one namely that it is a moving situation and that the statistics that are required i do not have <e> <s> nevertheless i would gladly make available to the noble lord or to anyone else at any time such information as we do have <e>", "<cs> my lords i would commend your lordships to read the recent survey carried out by coopers and lybrand for our department on service provision and pricing in local government <e> <s> it is an extremely informative arguably the most informative publication on this whole subject and could well be read with advantage by all who are interested <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> in no way should that control be weakened <e> <s> in any case statutory obligations rest with the local authorities to ensure that the services are carried out the end responsibility is still theirs <e> <s> however there is no reason why carrying out a service through the channel that we have been discussing need in any way be to the detriment of local authorities <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the noble lords proposed amendment to clause is closely linked to his proposed new clause in that both taken together are intended to prevent the legitimacy of the glcs expenditure on travel concessions from being challenged in the courts particularly on the ground that the glc has breached its fiduciary duty to its ratepayers <e> <s> i can understand the fears <e> <s> they were aired when this bill was considered in another place and the then parliamentary under-secretary of state for transport dealt with the point <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill might like to look at what he said in <e>", "<cs> just as when the noble lord lord underhill in moving his amendment declared his interest i assumed he would not have any reservations or inhibitions about voting any more than he did about speaking to the amendment so i should have thought that that would apply to my noble friends and indeed to anybody else who wished to vote <e>", "<cs> had i attempted as the noble lord lord mishcon asked me to do at second reading to spell out exactly what local authorities should do in this direction or in any other for that matter i doubt very much whether they would have thanked me even if i had decided so to try which clearly was impossible to do <e> <s> i repeat what this bill sets out to do is to oblige the greater london council to be in exactly the same position as all other local authorities neither forward nor behind <e> <s> i do not think we need to go further <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord underhill has said i had covered in my original response what i wanted to say on this as well as on the first amendment <e> <s> again i see no reason to go any further than we are going no need for the concern that the noble lord has expressed because if it applies to the greater london council then it applies to all other local authorities <e> <s> so far as i am aware they are not lining up for some new powers for some new clarifications or for some new statutory legislation to specify precisely what is needed <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might quickly add a final word <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill said that he wants to ensure that these arrangements are not made subject to challenge in the courts <e> <s> but the bill cannot spell out the details of the concessions operated by the glc and it would be wrong to try to do so <e> <s> what the amendment would do is to say that any arrangements would be immune from challenge <e> <s> clearly that must be wrong <e> <s> the glc has the power to take ratepayers money and it has a duty to ensure that that money is dealt with responsibly <e> <s> in my submission the glc should not be exempted from that duty however worthy the nature of the cause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for raising this matter <e> <s> i think there is no difference on any side as to the desirability of helping with this type of provision for new starters low-cost home ownership and yes we will indeed continue to encourage it in every way possible <e>", "<cs> my lords ministers have no authority to interpret the law that is a matter for the courts <e> <s> it is in the first instance the district auditors duty to consider whether in spending money on this advertisement the glc have acted within their powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure there must be very few in your lordships house who are not sad that the very high reputation that local government enjoys in this country should be so brought into what i consider disrepute by this type of as i would consider frankly deplorable some would say contemptible type of publication <e> <s> but as to the points that my noble friend specifically asks in detail of course the glc indeed every authority has to make available knowledge as to what it spends on everything <e> <s> that has to come out sooner or later in the form of an annual report <e> <s> beyond that this is obviously something which is running and which will go on running i am unhappy to say but as to the responsibility for it at the end of the day as i say only the courts can decide whether it is other than legal and only the district auditor to whom anyone can refer anything can decide whether it should be submitted to them <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i do not think there is any way in which these two situations are comparable and the fact is that the ratepayers of london are the ones who are footing the bill for this kind of publication <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i understand what my noble friend is saying <e> <s> i was not aware of the exact figures and i am sure they will be of interest now that he has exposed them in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords the leader of the house will certainly speak for herself but i would not have thought that there was anything at all wrong in any member of your lordships house raising anything at all that they felt ought to be put as a question <e> <s> i really see no harm in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not noticed that the noble lord himself had at any time been slow in coming forward to make any political point he wants either by way of question or in any other way and no one really objects to that because that is how it is <e> <s> but i think that the main objection to what many consider to be the offensive nature of the particular matter to which my noble friend has drawn attention is twofold <e> <s> one is that it is being paid for by ratepayers many of whom very bitterly resent that it is so and secondly the first point i made that the general standards the integrity the levels of local government really are being brought into disrepute <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> first of all i would not agree secondly i think we are moving away from the original question that was asked and the original caricature and indeed the wording of it which was brought to our attention in the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords on the point of wattage i have nothing before me upon it <e> <s> however i should not have thought that it ought to be a problem <e> <s> obviously the wattage will vary <e> <s> the requirements as to standards must surely apply i should have thought regardless of the wattage <e> <s> if that is not so i shall of course let the noble lord know <e> <s> as to his point about whether there will be stocks in some peoples hands after the six-month period i suppose there must always be that possibility <e> <s> hopefully it would only be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his great interest in this matter and for his raising it here <e> <s> i hear what he says about a visit and will certainly see that his suggestion is passed on to my right honourable friend <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend is aware that in fact british shipbuilders have received an important export order from scandinavian customers at the swan hunter yard which also bid for the p o order <e> <s> nevertheless what my noble friend has said is helpful and i gladly undertake to convey it to those concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will repeat a statement which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords for their observations <e> <s> i should like to pick up some of the points raised by the noble lord lord strabolgi <e> <s> he said that the decision was disappointing for energy and i can understand that <e> <s> however if one looks carefully at the implications for jobs which come out as the thrust of the noble lords concern and the noble lord lord tanlaw raised the point which i think must be the important counterpoint i should like to say that my right honourable friend fully accepts the importance of this aspect of the whole matter <e> <s> we realise that the development of the vale of belvoir coalfield would ameliorate the effect of pit closures in leicestershire and nottinghamshire and we believe that it is possible for the environmental objections to be overcome and for fresh applications to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had made it clear i tried to spell it out very carefully in my response to the noble lord lord strabolgi that the last point that the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe makes is of as much concern to the government as it is to those who have raised it <e> <s> i said that we felt it was entirely possible for there to be the kind of timescale which would enable us to have a situation where there will be no need at all to be looking for the alternative types of employment that the noble lord lord strabolgi asked about because in our view if it all goes forward as it could then there is no reason why they should not be mining in these same fields <e>", "<cs> my lords just to acknowledge what my noble friend has said he simply confirms the point i was trying to make as to the difficulty in coming to a balanced decision in a matter of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord but i hope he will not mind if in thanking him i stress again my understanding of the concern expressed on the other aspects of the matter about which we are equally as sensitive as we are about the one which he very helpfully raises <e>", "<cs> in the form of a question <e>", "<cs> the last point that the noble lord made does not take us very much further <e> <s> i am aware of the importance of what he has said about the need for continuity <e> <s> i hope that i have gone to some pains to try to emphasise this afternoon the importance that we attach to this time factor which we recognise clearly and it is on all the advice that i am given that i say that if the coal board wish to move with everyone moving forward as we hope i cannot prejudge any decision that would be taken there is an opportunity for us to get to where i think noble lords who are quite properly so anxious on the employment matter for the mineworkers want to be if we can move in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware to what extent if any there would be higher expenditure <e> <s> the noble lord is more knowledgeable than i on this subject and i am sure that what he says will be considered <e> <s> i think it is proper to say that in terms of the time to be taken much of the ground has been covered already <e> <s> there has been so much discussion and the report is very detailed and that in itself would surely be a much briefer need when a further application is made if it is made <e> <s> and that should be encouraging too <e>", "<cs> my lords one can look at it in that way if one wishes <e> <s> one might also look at the fact that the people who have bought them now own their own homes which many feel is a very desirable state <e>", "<cs> my lords when one talks of market value one really has to talk about historic costs <e> <s> market value is a notional figure which has no meaning until a sale is made <e> <s> one has to look at the historic costs of these dwellings to really ascertain whether a profit or a loss has been made <e> <s> that surely is a better way to assess the real performance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend and i certainly do agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i would hardly have thought that the noble lord lord jacques would press the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend and i certainly endorse his remarks <e>", "<cs> the government have no objection in principle to further provision to control roadside sales <e> <s> however there is a need to amend the drafting of this clause so as to avoid speaking in terms of an obstruction of the passage of traffic over the road when it appears that an obstruction on the highway irrespective of its effect on passage is a nuisance <e> <s> also it appears to be necessary for other changes to be made to fit the clause into the context of this bill <e> <s> i should therefore like to tell my noble friend that we would want to consider the clause in more detail with a view to a government amendment being put down at report <e>", "<cs> i too propose to speak to the group of five amendments <e> <s> we feel that in practice it is unnecessary to require a local authority to consult statutory undertakers <e> <s> our concern is that consultation could prove inflexible and onerous not to say time consuming <e> <s> for example in a great many cases a local authority will be aware without needing to consult that the services of statutory undertakers are likely to be affected and indeed as the noble lord lord foot himself very fairly said it is reasonable to suppose that in such circumstances the authority will properly exericse its discretion under paragraph <e>", "<cs> i was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> zf and za <e>", "<cs> it is amendment no <e> <s> zf the noble baroness is quite right <e>", "<cs> i am glad the noble baroness keeps those questions until a little later <e> <s> might i say that i entirely accept her point about the shortage of time in which to deal with amendments <e> <s> i would also hope that she would accept from me that there have been times when i have sat on this bench and been given manuscript amendments which were handed in five minutes previously and upon which one has been expected to make observations and comments <e> <s> i am sure she will have the same sympathy with me as i have with her on this point <e>", "<cs> i sometimes wonder about that <e> <s> i gave an illustration recently did i not <e> <s> in your lordships house of the kind of briefing one can get from time to time <e> <s> some may consider it helpful some may not <e> <s> perhaps no more for the moment <e>", "<cs> it was because the local authorities could not recover their expenses in the kind of cases to which the noble baroness referred that they were given power to take speedy action in housing act cases with no right of appeal for the owner <e> <s> the noble baroness will no doubt be pleased to hear me say that we are proposing that there be a government amendment to give owners a right of appeal against an authoritys notice of proposed works or against a demand for costs where no notice is given <e> <s> this will remove any objections on those grounds to local authorities being able to recover their costs <e> <s> consequently the government are content that subsection be omitted from the bill and we accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> the government cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> it is thought that the requirement for local authorities to copy to the gas and electricity undertakers but not i notice to the undertakers concerned with the supply of water any notice they give under the clause would impose an unnecessary burden on local government at the present time <e> <s> the local authority can be expected to consult on the matter if that was thought to be necessary <e> <s> we do not think there is a need for a provision to save undertakers rights to enter buildings in exercise of their statutory powers <e> <s> the view taken is that nothing which a local authority does under the clause can prejudice the exercise of statutory powers conferred on statutory undertakers to enter buildings for the purpose of carrying out work to their apparatus <e>", "<cs> the question of a penalty or otherwise is one thing <e> <s> the government feel that the reason why apart from the earlier reasons we did not want to accept the noble lords amendment was because there were the powers in the rights of entry gas and electricity boards act which we think cover the point <e> <s> there should be no problem <e> <s> one would want to look into that more carefully <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord lord foot and the noble baroness will do so <e>", "<cs> i am not aware of any specific requirement in that way <e> <s> one can have a look at it <e> <s> that i shall gladly do <e>", "<cs> clearly one will want to consider carefully what my noble friend says <e> <s> i had longer speaking notes but felt it seemed fairly straightforward <e> <s> having listened to my noble friend it sounds anything but straightforward <e> <s> it would be only proper that i should say that we ought to look at this amendment again in the light of what has been said <e> <s> the object of the whole exercise is to make it a better way to <e>", "<cs> in view of what i have said my noble friend is right i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should prefer to reconsider these amendments and bring them all back together <e> <s> that will be the proper way to deal with them <e> <s> i have not the slightest doubt that what my noble friend says is technically correct <e> <s> it will be as well if we are looking at the other points to look also at this <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble baroness is a magistrate <e> <s> i am a magistrate as i know many other noble lords are and normally it is a question of level <e> <s> i would have thought that was the reason why there is one in one case and the other in the other <e> <s> as the whole matter is being taken away we shall look at that <e> <s> when we bring it back i shall make an observation on that to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> as can be seen from the long discussion which has taken place and which i suspect would have continued even longer were it not for the hour this is a matter of considerable interest and it is right that it should be so <e> <s> as the noble lord lord northfield said this is not something new something that is being raised all of a sudden <e> <s> this has been going on for a long time <e> <s> it has been brought to a head by the fact that in the powers which local authorities currently have will be coming to an end and therefore something has to be done <e> <s> the noble lord was very kind in what he said about my own participation in the wording of the report to the extent that i was not involved he is quite right <e> <s> but that would not lead me on to say that i did not think that the burns report as it has come to be known is other than a very helpful document <e> <s> after all it is what it says no one has made the point sufficiently clearly that it is a consultation paper and as such it is open to anyone to comment upon it in any way they wish <e> <s> as i said at the time of our last debate on this subject the comments made by the noble lord lord northfield will as on this occasion make a very considerable contribution to our thinking <e>", "<cs> may i first of all say that i have listened very carefully to all your lordships who have spoken and especially at the beginning to the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> may i say that i admired very much as i always do his assiduousness and his articulation <e> <s> he is always so persuasive but i think he knows better than most perhaps that this is not an easy one to put over to your lordships <e> <s> may i say also that i unreservedly accept that the movers and the supporters of the amendment are as he says in earnest and that they feel very deeply about this matter <e> <s> i think that should be made quite clear straight away <e>", "<cs> of course everyone shares the distaste for the spray-painting of slogans or other expressions on walls and buildings and the government no less than the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs the noble lord <e> <s> lord evans and i am sure everyone in your lordships committee <e> <s> however we do not think it advisable to extend clause to spray-painting because it would then be brought within the statutory system of planning control over outdoor advertisements thus giving it an additional importance which we feel is unwarranted <e> <s> in practice most of these slogans or expressions appear on public buildings or other buildings or street furniture whose owner is either a public body or some other person or organisation who will not want offensive or defamatory slogans or expressions to appear on their premises <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord said and certainly i shall discuss this with colleagues <e> <s> the problems which it would present as i suggested in my original remarks are perhaps greater than we realise <e> <s> however i am so sympathetic with the intention behind what is proposed that i think the very least i can do is to say yes i will take it away to look at and consider it with colleagues <e> <s> the committee will understand that i am not able to go further than that and that i cannot promise we shall be able to do anything <e> <s> however i understand what is being said and i shall take the matter away and we shall talk about it <e>", "<cs> with regard to the last point i understand that this is part of the present home office review of the public order situation <e> <s> certainly the government are very cognisant of the points made and i am sure that the noble lord as well as the noble baroness lady david who touched on this aspect during her questions know that we all want to achieve the same ends <e> <s> it is a question of how we go about it <e> <s> i am assured that this matter is part of the present review <e> <s> with regard to the question about a <e>", "<cs> the difficulty here is that the amendment is open to two different interpretations each of which will lead to unacceptable results <e> <s> the first is that it would enable a local authority to establish a fund for the purpose of making payments to a voluntary assistant who has for example been injured pending the receipt of a payment from an insurance company with whom and for which purpose the local authority had entered into a contract of insurance <e> <s> the second is that it enables a local authority irrespective of the new powers which will be conferred by clause to establish a fund to meet expenditure in the making of payments to voluntary assistants who are injured killed or contract an illness as a result of the assistance which they offer to that authority <e> <s> if the first interpretation is the correct one the amendment is not desirable <e> <s> a local authority might make a payment out of a fund to an assistant in the event of an injury <e>", "<cs> if the second interpretation is the correct one then there are other difficulties <e> <s> while a voluntary assistant doubtless plays a useful role in helping a local authority in the discharge of its functions it should be recalled that a local authority has no statutory functions in relation to these assistants <e> <s> they are what clause says they are that is volunteers <e> <s> if a local authority has no statutory functions in relation to these assistants how can it be argued that a fund which can only be established by an authority in connection with its functions can <e>", "<cs> i imagine that the point turns on the matter of a local authoritys position in relation to the volunteer but certainly this is a matter which we must take up separately <e> <s> and of course i gladly undertake to do so <e>", "<cs> we are sympathetic to this amendment in so far as it covers probation service volunteers but feel i am sorry to have to say to my noble friend that the amendment as drafted much as i should have liked to accept it goes far too wide <e> <s> if my noble friend will withdraw it the government will consider introducing a suitable amendment at report stage which will be within the scope of the bill <e> <s> if so it will extend the power to insure voluntary assistants to probation service volunteers only <e>", "<cs> i too speak to this amendment and to amendments nos <e> <s> b a b a and b <e> <s> this clause is intended to confer on a local authority a clear and uncontroversial title to lost property or property simply left on local authority premises by its owner and it could defeat the object of the clause to make these provisions subject or without prejudice to any rule of law to the contrary <e> <s> the remedy to the owner of property under this clause is the requirement on the local authority to serve notice on him except where it is impossible to do so requesting him to collect his property <e> <s> similarly there may be a number of enactments which deal for example with lost property <e> <s> however the provisions of this clause are intended to confer the general power referred to on a local authority irrespective of any enactment to the contrary except in three specific cases <e> <s> these are a property found on local authority aerodromes or in aircraft on such aerodromes b property found on public service vehicles and c property found on any premises belonging to the london transport executive or under the control of the executive <e> <s> in all these cases special statutory provisions are made which are not affected by this clause otherwise the clause will apply as mentioned <e>", "<cs> the effect of the proposed amendment would be as has been said to extend the provisions of clause to property lost at a local authority aerodrome or on an aircraft on such an aerodrome <e> <s> i should remind your lordships that in their wisdom various governments have recognised that special problems arise at aerodromes which are not found in other walks of everyday life <e> <s> in recognition of this specific provision has been made for the regulation and operation of aerodromes and the conduct of persons while on aerodromes <e> <s> in the case of local authority aerodromes by-laws may be made and indeed have been made under the provisions of the civil aviation acts and <e> <s> the latter act relates specifically to property lost at local authority aerodromes and in aircraft at those aerodromes <e>", "<cs> certainly i would say to my noble friend that i will gladly undertake to do that <e> <s> i am advised that in fact there is no such doubt <e> <s> but certainly i take the point and we shall look at it again <e> <s> should what my noble friend says be correct then of course we would want to do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord is aware that at the present time the sums of money available to district authorities of this kind is in total over million whereas their take-up at the present time is some million <e> <s> but even so i think the basic answer is that that is why we have put out a consultation paper <e> <s> when we receive the results of the consultations we shall take very careful note of them as well as of the statements which i know the noble lord himself has made and the statements that have been made in debates in your lordships house in the last week or two <e> <s> we are indeed considering the point which i acknowledge is one of much importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point the noble lord lord shinwell makes but i have to say again that hitherto the take-up has not been anything like the amount available <e> <s> nevertheless the basic point is valid and we recognise it and that is why we have the consultation paper and why we are listening to what noble lords have to say on this matter <e> <s> helping small businesses is indeed a key priority for the government <e> <s> i would also point to the some measures this government have taken to do that which we would claim is more than any government have ever done before in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the right honourable gentleman as i am sure the noble lord would agree <e> <s> the fact is that what we are proposing here is another form of allowance to enable local authorities to do things beyond those they are able to do at the present time consistent with certain other constraints upon them <e> <s> it is really the question of whether or not this is adequate which is a matter of debate at the moment <e> <s> in many of the areas of <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly i cannot state specifically what that effect is because of the wide difference in different authorities but that there is an effect upon employment caused by excessively high rates is now beyond any question <e>", "<cs> my lords the point is that at present local government has powers to act <e> <s> it is intended in the consultation paper that there shall be a certain reduction of those powers <e> <s> but at present the authorities do have powers to act beyond what is in the consultation paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness makes a very fair point <e> <s> i would only want to know in the case which she has mentioned whether the authority was in fact at present taking up the whole of its allocation <e> <s> clearly i do not know and possibly at this moment the noble baroness does not know <e> <s> however the noble baronesss point about the extent to which training or for that matter anything else is included or excluded is of importance and i am hoping that that will be something that will be shown up when we get the returns on the consultation paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for bringing out the point but perhaps i could offer him even more encouragement by saying that as we are watching this so closely if the success for which we are hoping is shown he would not have to wait the four or five years to which he refers <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that the noble lord knows the great difference between the special development areas and the enterprise zones <e> <s> many concessions are given in the enterprise zones that do not apply anywhere else not the least of which is the freedom from paying rates <e> <s> at this stage i do not think that the house would want me to reel off all the other concessions but they are very considerable and there is quite a difference <e> <s> i know that everyone is hoping that they will be the success which i think they will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the special development areas have the worst employment situation in the country <e> <s> i hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> but whether it is those areas or any other areas because of the success that we are hoping to see in the enterprise zones when we are considering where others should be we shall certainly take into account the point that the noble lord makes <e>", "<cs> my lords i learn something new every day and have done yet again <e> <s> i take the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear i cannot comment on that <e> <s> if the noble lord would like me to look into it further and be in communication with him i gladly undertake to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords again i fear that it is too early for me to be able to do that <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will know that one of the features within the zones is that we are not calling for as much statistical information and as many returns as one normally does outside the zones <e> <s> nevertheless i understand the point that my noble friend is making and i would think that it will not be long before government will be saying much more about what is being achieved <e> <s> i am anxious not to be saying all the goodies which are taking place and then leading to disappointments but we are very encouraged by what is going on and so i hope will be your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to begin by congratulating my noble friend lady gardner of parkes on selecting so interesting a subject for what is i think the first debate that she has initiated in this house <e> <s> it is of course a broad subject and there can be few government policies which do not in some measure affect our urban areas <e> <s> i hope therefore that noble lords will forgive me if i do not respond to all of the points mentioned some of which indeed fall slightly outside my own province <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give an immediate answer to the noble baroness on that point because it is one of the many points at which we are looking <e> <s> we have appointed people to monitor what is happening and to give an independent view <e> <s> in addition we are in touch with the local people who are trying to develop <e> <s> therefore so far as i am concerned what the noble baroness says is part of the whole situation which we shall watch carefully <e> <s> if there is some way in which we can do something better we shall not hesitate to do so because this is another genuine attempt to do something about these areas <e> <s> as i <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to say that <e> <s> as regards my right honourable friends involvement when he starts to talk to me about things being not fair in liverpool i know that he is really getting the message there because he is speaking with the liverpool accent <e> <s> it is a pity that the noble lord lord sefton is not here i am sure that he would come to my aid on that <e> <s> but he would say that it is not fair at all <e>", "<cs> i am tempted my lords and in view of my noble friends interruption the very least i can do is refer specifically to the point he made about the number of small sites standing idle in inner areas and he even suggested that some of them should be given away to people willing to develop them <e> <s> so far as scottish cities are concerned i must refer that suggestion to the scottish office and i take pleasure in so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very glad to pass on the noble lords comments to those concerned <e> <s> he may be interested to know that i understand that the contractor will soon be making available a third lane at the perivale signals <e> <s> this should come about within the next few weeks <e>", "<cs> the object of this bill is to include in public legislation these uncontroversial matters appearing regularly in local authority rationalisation bills which are being promoted by local authorities as a result of the lapse of their legislation by the end of under section of the local government act <e> <s> to that extent the proposed amendment is not consistent with the object of the bill <e> <s> indeed in so far as the amendment seeks to impose an obligation on statutory undertakers i wonder whether it is even within the scope of the bill <e>", "<cs> in so far as the amendment seeks to impose an obligation on statutory undertakers i said i wondered whether it was even within the scope of the bill <e> <s> the noble baroness puts forward a powerful case for suggesting it is within its scope and clearly others would adjudicate on that <e> <s> however the main thrust of my response was to the substance of the matter concerning those who tabled the amendment who i hope will feel that the position now is a major advance on what it was previously <e>", "<cs> i hear what my noble friend says <e> <s> so far as i am aware i am able to answer in the affirmative but as always my noble friend quite properly raises matters which concern the isle of wight and i would assure him that i shall take further advice <e> <s> i undertake that should it prove that his fears are in any way justified i shall write to him and tell him exactly what is the position <e>", "<cs> i confirm that we consulted the local authority associations on this issue as i assured your lordships we would do <e> <s> they responded in a very swift and if i may say so a very constructive fashion though understandably and i take the noble baronesss point they were concerned about the short time allowed <e> <s> of course we should have liked to have allowed more time by using the order procedure under clause but as i have explained we do not consider that that course is practicable in relation to the local act provisions in question <e> <s> in principle all the associations appear to recognise the practicality of what we are now proposing though i must say that naturally they express some reservations which the department has tried in discussions to satisfy <e> <s> i cannot withdraw the amendments but i am sure the noble baroness will recognise that if between now and report there arise any specific troublesome points we can always discuss them with those concerned <e> <s> i should have thought that that was probably the way to proceed <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble baroness will accept from me that i perhaps more than most should like to believe that local authorities will not feel in any way badly done to for whatever reason <e> <s> i think it is also fair to say in connection with this whole bill that there has been a great deal of con <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by saying that i too am not without some sympathy for what the noble lord lord underhill said in moving the second reading of this bill <e> <s> nevertheless i must ask your lordships to oppose it because i have to say that it is simply not the right way to tackle the problems of public transport in london <e>", "<cs> i should have thought we were not talking about the same thing by any manner of means <e>", "<cs> and if the noble lord is suggesting that there should be some dramatic reduction in the subsidy to british rail then that is a point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords why have fares doubled <e> <s> to put what has happened in perspective we need to relate the new fares to what they were before they were cut last october <e> <s> in fact they are now about one-third higher in cash terms than they were six months ago <e> <s> the last increase before that was in september <e> <s> if the previous policy had continued there would have had to be some increase since then to take account of increased costs <e> <s> the new fare levels are in fact about per cent <e> <s> above what would have been needed to keep up with inflation over the last months <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not that point was also dealt with in another place i am not aware <e> <s> but this was discussed elsewhere and accepted in the way that i suggested <e> <s> perhaps i could move on to another point that the noble baroness made <e> <s> there is some reason to quarrel with some of the figures that the noble baroness quoted regarding what it will cost to restore the abatement of unemployment pay but on reflection that is something we had better take up on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i specifically said earlier in connection with relief and other work that we do not expect authorities to do it without it costing money and that we are cognisant of that fact <e> <s> in principle therefore i do not quarrel with what the noble lord says <e> <s> however the transport supplementary grant has to be part of the whole scene <e> <s> there could be big savings for bulk freight and anyone who is sceptical should simply ask british industry or british shippers and my noble friend lord mottistone made the point as he so often does for them <e> <s> these important benefits will also extend to agriculture which is a major user of bulk freight <e> <s> fertiliser oil and other goods will be delivered to farms more efficiently <e> <s> there will also be savings in the cost of moving produce from farms especially for heavy produce such as sugar beet potatoes and milk but also for many other horticultural products where some use could be made of the increased payloads <e>", "<cs> my lords we want to read very carefully what my noble friend has said <e> <s> he made his <e>", "<cs> my lords where do i begin <e> <s> so far as the sum of million which is available to the glc using section of the act is concerned my understanding is that my noble friend is right <e> <s> my noble friend also asked me whether this is unique <e> <s> in that this is the authority which has the largest budget i think it is correct to say that this is the greatest sum available to any authority <e> <s> i do not know of any other authority which approaches that figure <e> <s> my noble friends point as to whether or not under the proposals in the consultation paper one should put a ceiling on such a levy is something which we shall have to think about in just the same way as we are being messed by very small authorities to consider putting a floor upon it <e> <s> as i am sure my noble friend knows there is the other side to it <e> <s> i understand the anxiety which my noble friend has expressed <e> <s> it is one with which i am sure everybody is concerned <e> <s> we shall have to watch carefully what transpires <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that everybody in the country who is interested in the reputation and standing of local government is concerned about the possibility that any authority whichever it may be might bring into disrepute the whole of local government by an abuse of the powers which they have <e> <s> all i said in answering my noble friend was that we must watch this as we shall watch any other authority which may be taking advantage of some power that may lead them into perhaps irresponsible expenditure <e> <s> however at the end of the day the decision as to whether or not it is irresponsible will rest with the electorate and with the auditor <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say to my noble friend that in so far as i understand the intention of this proposal and indeed of like proposals by other authorities which are contemplating setting up organisations of this kind the objective is to involve private funding as well as municipal funding <e> <s> in other words it is to pump prime it is to encourage involvement <e> <s> if it is that i am sure my noble friend will be pleased to see that it transpires <e> <s> the concern is that it would become not that but something which would be entirely municipal <e> <s> then the concern of ratepayers wherever they may be would be very real <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i did not suggest that the setting up of this body was other than within the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to confirm that is so <e> <s> the london enterprise agency is doing excellent work which i think would be applauded by everyone in this house <e>", "<cs> would that it was always so my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the figure mentioned by my noble friend is correct <e> <s> if it is correct it is something that would trouble me very much <e> <s> as a london ratepayer nowadays <e> <s> indeed it does trouble me <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for individual local authorities to decide how much they spend on council house building and how much on other ways of helping those in housing need <e> <s> as i am sure the noble lord will agree waiting lists are a far from accurate indicator of housing need but one way of helping to reduce waiting lists is to enourage people to buy their own homes under the various low cost home ownership schemes which the government are promoting <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the question of waiting lists and their validity and what the government should do to help them become more realistic clearly this is something that one can think about but i doubt very much whether local authorities will welcome any intervention by government to do that <e> <s> i am glad that through his question the noble lord lord molloy who i know has much experience in this field recognises the point that i made in my original answer that waiting lists are not the accurate guide that some would think they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the <e>", "<cs> i think it should be on housing as a whole <e> <s> in any case the question of the total housing scene is surely something that must be of concern in any question on building <e> <s> it is not just building that is the answer to our problems <e> <s> how can we be so obsessed with the number of council houses as part of the housing problem when we refuse as the noble baroness did in her question to address ourselves to the other points i made on the condition of houses throughout the country and the empty dwellings which there are <e>", "<cs> my lords the total number of empty houses throughout the country is many many thousands <e> <s> as to the exact number in any one area clearly i cannot know at this particular moment in time <e> <s> however i am glad that my noble friend has raised the point because it confirms what i myself was trying to say that this must be a matter of great concern <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord molloy and those who think as he does were so concerned about those who wish to rent their homes then i suggest they would have adopted in the past and will adopt in the future a different attitude from that which they have adopted in respect of the private rented sector <e>", "<cs> my lords to simply talk of numbers is to ignore the fact that in terms of total aggregate throughout the country today there is a surplus of houses over households <e> <s> that is something that one must face up to if one wants to look at housing as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i need no reminding that there are situations in individual areas which require attention and dealing with in a way different from other areas <e> <s> that does not take away from the fact that what i have said about the totality of housing is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> in fact the noble lord lord marsh was rebutting that only in an observation which he made when he said that he wondered who would in fact want to buy it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first speech which i have made in three years at this dispatch box the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if the noble lord lord beswick will allow me to continue <e> <s> i have listened patiently for four hours to every word that has been said <e> <s> i would like to continue and to pick up any points later <e> <s> if i miss any point and the noble lord would like me to comment upon it at the end of my remarks or later i will try to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i will cover that ground later <e> <s> the fact is that there is a clear responsibility which rests on the government to foster maximum efficiency in those industries which it owns on behalf of the nation <e> <s> i was glad to see that the noble lord lord beswick was concerned about this in the phrasing of his motion <e> <s> i entirely agree on the need for a positive policy to secure maximum efficiency <e> <s> so what are we doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that <e> <s> if he feels as i certainly do that this is a good thing then i welcome what he says <e> <s> if he wants me to go more into what their function will be i will have to come back to him on that on a later occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord feels that i am being flippant with him <e> <s> he would surely agree that he is frequently as flippant as anyone in your lordships house although in the most good-natured of ways which i for one always respect <e> <s> i am sorry that he feels upset by what i have said <e> <s> certainly i did not wish that <e> <s> if i upset him then i apologise unreservedly <e> <s> that was not the intention of what i was saying and i am sorry about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the concern which exists at the present time not least by people on all sides of local government and i thank my noble friend for drawing this matter to the attention of the house in the way he does <e>", "<cs> my lords in fact all the spending on whatever purpose is up to the local authority to decide <e> <s> the point that i think my noble friend was making was whether or not it was considered to be a fair proper or reasonable application and that is why i made the observation that i did <e>", "<cs> my lords i would give the same reply as i gave to the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> but i think it would also be proper to say that regardless of the amount of money there is concern on the point that my noble friend raises and i think proper concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what my noble friend is trying to get me to say <e> <s> i thought frankly that the use of the word in this context was not inappropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the bill has three purposes <e> <s> first it abolishes supplementary rates and precepts <e> <s> local authorities will therefore have to set their rates or precepts for complete financial years <e> <s> secondly it enables the secretary of state to protect from any general loss of grant local authorities which meet their individual spending targets <e> <s> thirdly it sets up an audit commission to be responsible for the audit of local authorities in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord please explain to us why this will no longer be possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very glad to hear the noble lord say that he knows i shall deal courteously with matters as we go along but i must say he does not make it easy does he <e> <s> we have had an interesting and in the main though not entirely constructive debate and i am certainly obliged to noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> because i happen to disagree with very much of what most of them said as i shall try to cover in a moment

that <e> <s> first i would remind the noble baroness of circular / when local government was told because the imf had been brought in that there must be an immediate reduction of per cent <e> <s> across the board <e> <s> that is an enormous reduction to make per cent <e> <s> across the board against the per cent <e> <s> reduction that we are calling for over three years <e> <s> let us keep it in perspective <e> <s> at that time what was local governments response <e> <s> they responded by doing it because that was the kind of sense of responsibility that they had then and that still exists today among the majority of people in local government <e> <s> my concern is about the minority who are not concerned <e> <s> we have to do something to protect first the countrys overall spending and we are talking here of a billion overspend in a year <e> <s> these are figures unheard of in the past <e> <s> they also have to take care of those who have to foot the bills at the end <e>", "<cs> as my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for the environment made clear in another place and as the noble lord intimated the government accept that there is a good case for making such charges eligible for housing benefit in line with the existing supplementary benefits scheme so that the noble lord is preaching to the converted on this matter <e> <s> the difficulty as always has been cost and as he has said we are talking about million a year <e> <s> however i am pleased to say that the government having gone into the matter carefully have decided that this change should be made and as no primary legislation is required as the powers in clause will already permit payment in respect of dwellings to form part of eligible rent for housing benefit purposes we intend to apply to the extra help both rebate and allowances schemes and not just rebates as suggested in the amendment <e> <s> in any case to follow that proposal would be unfair to private tenants <e> <s> with my assurance that furniture will be eligible i hope that that will please the noble lord and he will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before looking at the detail of the amendments may i remind the committee of our intentions regarding the needs allowances <e> <s> as my honourable friend the minister of social security announced in another place we shall continue the existing structure and under clause of the bill the secretary of state will review the needs allowances each year taking into account the general levels of prices and of housing costs <e> <s> noble lords will be aware that the needs allowance is based upon the supplementary benefit long-term scale rate per cent <e> <s> of <e>", "<cs> i think the noble baroness misunderstands me <e> <s> the various questions that i was saying had come forth came from the amendment in my respectful submission not from the proposals as they are now <e> <s> it was my suggestion that knowing how complex it all is it might be that the noble lord lord wallace would feel that he would want the opportunity if i were in his place i should to look at what i have said if you like as justification for what we are doing <e> <s> i suspect that that is what the noble lord will want to do <e>", "<cs> this new clause gives us an opportunity to discuss two important facets of the housing and benefit proposals as the noble lord rightly says the numbers of gainers and losers and the cost of the scheme <e> <s> lord wallace of coslanys proposal is something that we have seen tabled in another place in report stage <e> <s> the government are proposing that the tapers above the needs allowance should be increased to p and p so the scheme overall remains at nil cost <e> <s> this together with the other changes again as the noble lord rightly said would produce million losers and gainers among claimants with incomes above the needs allowance <e> <s> as my honourable friend the minister for social security explained in the other place the proposal still produces nearly million losers and no gainers above the needs allowance yet costs net an extra million more than the governments proposals <e>", "<cs> i agree very much with what the noble lord says about an important principle being involved <e>", "<cs> with respect that is not at all fair <e> <s> i am quite prepared here and now to go into a lengthy <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord quite fairly said the government are very sympathetic towards what is intended <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that officials have held a number of meetings with the local authority associations and the voluntary organisations most concerned to work out the most effective and practical way of ensuring that hostel dwellers are able to obtain help with their housing costs <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> there have been changes of the kind that she mentions just as there is also a very great need for many one-and two-bedroomed units <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not on this occasion want to move too far from the question as we did the other day when we were talking about housing but i would not agree with the noble lord because the fact is that if they wish to make this matter a priority local authorities now have great access to funds from capital receipts <e> <s> these will enable them to do anything that they may wish to do in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the problem is that there is such wide variation <e> <s> there are very many authorities which have the kind of percentage to which the noble baroness refers but there are some authorities where the proportion is just short of per cent <e> <s> of their housing stock and that is where the great problem arises <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord says and i am quite sure that what he describes is a contribution to the situation though it is not by any means the major contribution <e> <s> i strongly commend anyone who is interested in the question of how to reduce the number of empty dwellings to read the publication <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness raises a very fair point that the type of dwellings built under the systems to which she refers are a very real headache <e> <s> however it is surprising that in the main and so far as i am aware such dwellings do not comprise the majority of houses that are empty <e> <s> what we ought to be concerned about are the houses that are more run down and which have been empty for over a year <e> <s> in some areas several hundred dwellings have been empty and in the case of seven authorities there have been over dwellings empty for over a year <e> <s> such dwellings are not usually the type to which the noble baroness refers <e> <s> the houses that i have mentioned form the major part of the problem but i do not deny that what the noble baroness says is in itself correct <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult to be specific and i should prefer not to be so now <e> <s> i know that there are some authorities that adopt the attitude to which my noble friend refers but in regard to the situation as a whole the latest figure is <e> <s> it was so there has been some improvement in that it has come down to though that is bad enough <e> <s> it is a question of the policy that individual authorities want to adopt <e> <s> the point that my noble friend raised and the point that the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal raised are right in themselves as part of the overall problem but one has to go beyond that to see where the situation lies <e> <s> there is much scope for doing more not least in terms of selling some of the properties at low prices to people who want to make homesteads and themselves improve them <e> <s> i think that there is a lot of scope there <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first quarter of total starts on a seasonally adjusted basis were up per cent <e> <s> on the fourth quarter of and per cent <e> <s> higher than the first quarter of <e> <s> in the public sector making similar comparisons starts were up per cent <e> <s> on the previous quarter and per cent <e> <s> higher than a year ago <e> <s> private sector starts were up per cent <e> <s> on the previous quarter and per cent <e> <s> higher than a year earlier <e> <s> i hope my noble friend and the house will be as pleased with that news as i am <e>", "<cs> my lords a key part of the thrust of government policies is indeed towards seeing that interest rates come down so i certainly take the point my noble friend makes <e>", "<cs> i do not have those details today my lords the statement has only just been released but i gladly undertake to obtain it and write to the noble lord <e> <s> as for the way in which it is spread throughout the country again it is hard to say <e> <s> i am not sure whether that information will be so readily available but i shall endeavour to ascertain it and send it to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i would in no way quarrel with that <e> <s> it is just a question of my getting the information so that i am able to give it to the noble lord and that i undertake to do <e>", "<cs> i fear that that is not within my gift to do my lords <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness makes a fair point my lords and of course the numbers are important <e> <s> any information which is not in the statement would readily be available to her if she wished to press for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i touched on that when answering a question yesterday <e> <s> i assume by his supplementary that my noble friend is referring to homesteading <e> <s> we are doing everything we can to encourage it <e> <s> there are some encouraging signs and i hope that all local authorities because it is after all they who have to make the decisions about it will <e>", "<cs> my lords i can make no comment on what motorists think of my statements <e> <s> i understand very much what the noble lord is saying and his concern which we share <e> <s> in fact we are specifically making available a figure of coincidentally some million for the kind of work to which he referred because there is undoubtedly a problem in terms of what is under the surface as well as what is above it <e> <s> as to his point about workers on the dole perhaps doing some of the work i understand the short-term attraction of the option but the fact is that the average wage of a construction worker is as he will know substantially higher than the level of unemployment benefit and the difference becomes even greater when non-wage factors are brought into account <e> <s> thus the extra borrowing that would then be involved would in the longer term lead to higher inflation higher interest rates and higher taxes and that is a direction away from which we want to go <e>", "<cs> i did not make the statement in order to crow my lords but in response to a question that was put to me <e> <s> what the noble lord says is correct but i am sure that he too will be as pleased as i am that there has been an upward trend of some significance <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have taken several initiatives in this field <e> <s> first they have introduced in england registers of publicly-owned unused and underused land more than one acre in size <e> <s> those now cover districts in which has been identified a total acreage of over <e> <s> many sites are suitable for housing development <e> <s> secondly at the governments instance the house builders federation have made regional presentations to local authorities on low-cost starter homes with a view to getting land released for low-cost housing in partnership ventures <e> <s> in structure plans the aim is to provide for a five-year supply of land that is genuinely available <e>", "<cs> my lords within the first authorities with land registers over acres of land have been identified for housebuilding and i understand that so far acres have been disposed of albeit for a variety of purposes <e> <s> the other registers have been published only recently on the st april and last tuesday th may <e> <s> so we shall have to wait and see what is forthcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the problem to which the noble baroness refers and i should be very glad to discuss it with her later <e> <s> we are in fact making available million i think that is the figure for derelict land grant this year and that is the highest such figure ever <e> <s> we are extremely anxious to ensure that it is spent since in the past amounts intended for the purpose have not always been spent <e> <s> we will gladly work together with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the interest of the noble lord lord wallace of coslany in allotments and i am quite sure that he knows a darned sight more about them than i do <e> <s> on this point i would say only that i should not have thought that authorities were at all short of land and the information coming from the registers supports that view <e> <s> whether or not authorities wish to make land available for allotments is for them to decide <e> <s> i am sure that they will all read carefully what noble lords have said today <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the amount of land to which i have been referring acres was anything but small <e> <s> i should have thought that your lordships would have considered that to be an enormous amount i certainly do <e> <s> the great trick if i may use the word is to see how we can bring it back into use whereas hitherto it has not been used <e> <s> if we were to achieve that even in part it would make an enormous difference throughout the whole country <e> <s> i rather feel that that puts into perspective the point that the noble lord makes about the private sector <e> <s> if we can get the public sector right everything will flow <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that so far local authorities in england have sold or intend to sell unimproved houses for improvement by the purchaser <e> <s> during the calendar year dwellings were sold <e> <s> i would expect all the local authorities involved to be offering purchasers improvement grants for renovating the houses they buy <e> <s> furthermore of those authorities sold the properties with the aid of a local authority mortgage with agreement from my right honourable friend to waive interest payments on the mortgage for a period as an even greater incentive to buy and improve <e>", "<cs> my lords i would hope that the noble lord would bring to my notice any cases of the kind that he describes so that one can look at them carefully and see whether the procedures are too tortuous or whatever with a view to improving them <e> <s> as to the two schemes that he mentioned i had heard of them <e> <s> it will be interesting to know more of what they bring forth as time goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends in each case on what the figures show <e> <s> in fact the grants now go up to per cent <e> <s> which is very significant indeed and the government are absolutely determined to do all they can to improve this aspect of housing within which we feel there is such great opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right and we are very keen indeed <e> <s> that is why we have allocated much larger funds than ever before for insulation grants <e> <s> it may well be as the noble lord says that even greater publicity ought to be brought to bear on this <e> <s> he will know that already there is much more than ever before but nevertheless the underlying point of his question is very valid <e> <s> we must look all the time to see that we are bringing this grant to the notice of people <e>", "<cs> my lords the improvement-for-sale scheme under the act came into effect in november <e> <s> i understand that since then approximately local authorities have undertaken or are intending to undertake improvement-for-sale <e> <s> authorities do not have to offer dwellings to first-time buyers but the sale price of such dwellings is relatively low they are an attractive proposition for such purchasers and some local authorities give first-time buyers priority when offering such dwellings for sale <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i assumed that we would be speaking to a number of amendments because so many are very similar but as the noble baroness specifically stated she was covering amendments nos <e> <s> and i will do the same and reserve my observations on others because i think the points may come in a little later <e> <s> in the main the noble baroness spoke about her concern for emergencies that can arise <e> <s> i understand the cause of the concern for example the bad weather last winter did much damage and authorities were put to considerable extra work but as far as is known no local authority has ever levied a supplementary rate or a supplementary precept to finance expenditure <e>", "<cs> just very briefly may i say in reply to what the noble lord lord bruce said about the increased cost of statutory provisions that i am sure he knows that the levels of statutory provisions are very flexible indeed <e> <s> they are really for interpretation by individual authorities and i assure the noble lord that many authorities interpret them in very different ways <e> <s> he said not unfairly that the local electorate can give a view on an authoritys performance and in theory that is right <e> <s> i should be much happier so far as rates levels and services are concerned if the people who pay per cent <e> <s> of the rates industry and commerce had a vote of some kind which was meaningful <e> <s> unhappily they do not and therefore to some extent it diminishes the case for that <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down she said that we are in a new ball game that local government is now being squeezed <e> <s> i should like to remind her of circular / under which the then labour government imposed upon local government the instructions of the international monetary fund a cut in expenditure an immediate cut of per cent <e> <s> within that one year <e> <s> if that was not being squeezed and if it was not the same ball game as the noble baroness thinks we are in now i do not know what is <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness had better try to prove that they are better off as a result of the extra rates which are being charged <e>", "<cs> i am absolutely certain that the noble baroness lady fisher of rednall is not wrong about the figures she has read out but in her interpretation of them she is absolutely wrong <e> <s> the fact is that industry and commerce pay an average percentage rate throughout the country of about per cent <e> <s> of all the rates which are paid <e> <s> the noble baroness has quoted a figure of per cent <e> <s> but she may be looking in the wrong column or on the wrong page <e>", "<cs> i do not want to go on at length about that point but we will go into it later on i am quite sure <e> <s> i do not want to go on at length about this amendment because we are slowly moving into other areas which are completely off the subject <e> <s> the subject of this amendment is really supplementary rates <e> <s> i will make only one brief observation which is to say why both my noble friend lord mottistone and i feel that this is indeed a wrecking amendment that does drive a coach and horses through the bill despite what was said by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> paragraph c of the suggested new subsection would allow local authorities to continue to raise a supplementary rate or precept for any and i quote unanticipated loss of income <e> <s> that is so wide that clearly it is impossible in view of what has happened not in years gone by but in the last year or two <e> <s> this is a safeguard that we are bringing about for ratepayers who cannot accept the unanticipated burden which could come upon them suddenly for whatever reason <e> <s> that is why i strongly oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> before i respond to the amendment i should like to say a few words in reply to the point that the noble baroness made prior to introducing amendment no <e> <s> when she referred to the problems of herself and her colleagues as regards the amount of time they had to look at amendments <e> <s> let me say at once that i very much regret that <e> <s> as she knows one tries very hard to ensure that all information notes on clauses and anything else that noble lords opposite feel they would need to enable them properly to study to comment on and to criticise and to move amendments to the bill is made readily available <e> <s> when amendments come in late i am as sorry about it as anyone else but the fact is that on this occasion it was not least at the behest of her colleagues in another place that first there should be amendments secondly specifically that they should be very carefully considered and gone into in detail and thirdly that there should be as much consultation with the associations as possible <e> <s> i assure the noble baroness that that has in fact been done but it has taken time admittedly longer than one would have hoped <e> <s> i can only apologise to the noble baroness and her colleagues on that <e>", "<cs> i am happy to say that so far in your lordships house i have never been in opposition and i hope it will be a long time before that unhappy state of affairs comes about <e> <s> nevertheless i hope that i can comply with the noble baronesss request <e> <s> i confess that i have some doubts about amendments being tabled late <e> <s> certainly for what they are worth notes on clauses will be available at all times <e> <s> if the noble baroness would like clarification and explanation i shall readily make that available through the department because we are all concerned to get as good a bill as possible <e> <s> this is not about scoring points <e> <s> if it means that we get meaningful debate then i am absolutely content as to that <e>", "<cs> i said that i would not enter into a debate and nor shall i but i should like to comment on the first point which the noble lord made <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce made the point that it was the result of the economic situation he was picking up something i said on the earlier amendment that led to the whole problem of shortage of funds and economic difficulty <e> <s> in fact he referred and i wrote it down as he knows i always do to economic policies as dead as a dodo and so on <e> <s> i shall say only this and this will be my <e>", "<cs> i really must smile at the noble lord lord bruce of donington who today seems to be beginning his speech on each amendment with an all-out attack on the governments economic policies <e> <s> he then slowly swings to the subject of the amendment which i entirely agree he puts in the most reasonable of terms <e> <s> would that the content of his remarks was as reasonable as the way he makes them <e> <s> that would make me much happier but perhaps it is too much for which to hope <e>", "<cs> i must say that coincidentally the amount which i think the noble lord referred to as an overspending equates almost exactly to the amount by which local government as a whole has overspent its budgets <e> <s> we are talking of about billion which is a horrific figure <e> <s> we used to talk of or <e> <s> they were enormous amounts at one time but here we are faced with an overspend by <e>", "<cs> it has to be said that these amendments would wreck part i of the bill <e> <s> as we now know the object of part i is to ban supplementary rates and precepts and all other aspects of part i follow from that and exist to ensure that it will be satisfactorily achieved <e> <s> if these amendments were to be accepted there would be nothing to stop local authorities from making a supplementary rate or precept <e> <s> there would be little point in proceeding with the rest of clauses and since this would simply ensure that any supplementary rate or precept would have to be made like the original rate or precept for the whole year <e> <s> the value of clause would be undermined and there would be no purpose in extending for example the greater london councils power to borrow with the secretary of states approval <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure what the noble baroness means by covered by <e>", "<cs> a supplementary rate would always be for less than a whole year <e>", "<cs> i think not <e> <s> as always i will look into the point that the noble baroness makes and should it be otherwise i will come back to her <e> <s> my interpretation is that there is not this problem at the point she makes <e> <s> i will undertake to look at it <e>", "<cs> i think that the exercise is not doing any harm <e> <s> maybe i shall have to have some more of it because i fear that i cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness said as has been said a few times today that the supplementary rate is seldom used <e> <s> the point is that the supplementary rate was seldom used <e> <s> unhappily it is because in the last year or so it has not been seldom used that we are dealing with this whole matter today in the way that we are <e> <s> i do not see the problem to which the noble baroness refers <e> <s> if it were so then what has been going on in scotland all these years <e> <s> they have not had all this trauma and drama that we hear about <e>", "<cs> before the house decides to do so perhaps i should just say that first i hope the noble lord knows that the consultation date finished at the end of march <e> <s> there was the most extensive consultation on the green paper although there were those who said they needed longer but there would always be those who said that <e> <s> the noble lord could be surprised on this whether pleasantly or not will depend upon the form it takes and i am not going to be drawn today however much i am tempted and i am tempted to put a time on it <e> <s> the noble lord knows it does not work like that <e> <s> the fact is that we are now analysing the results of the consultation <e> <s> we are seized as i said before to the noble lord lord evans of the importance of this <e> <s> he is quite right there is a commitment in the party manifesto <e> <s> we are well aware of that and we understand the importance of it <e> <s> more i will not say today despite the great temptation to do so because if it were that easy it would have been done years ago <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness knows that i should like to help and that i should like to say yes we will have a look at it <e> <s> but i must be honest about it and say that although i will talk i always do in any case about matters that are raised where there seems to be some concern on a matter which is not absolutely cut and dried when i contemplate what it would mean to have it for a year with all the difficulties that would impose i do not think we can do anything <e> <s> what would be the situation if we said that we would have it for a year and then if there were no problems no supplementary rates and so on we said that we would therefore no longer insist on this <e> <s> those who had been doing <e>", "<cs> i understand what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i cannot give her the absolute assurance that she wants much as i understand the point that she is making <e> <s> therefore i cannot go any further <e>", "<cs> if i were to use the same kind of emotive language throughout this whole committee stage i am sure we would not get as far as we ought to get <e> <s> i can use words like rotten package and all the rest <e> <s> i do not think it really advances the noble lords case and i do not intend to do that kind of thing <e> <s> so far as my experience goes it was always understood that whether you won or lost i come from an authority where control changed very often if you gained control when the opposition had made the rates you stuck with that rate <e> <s> there are always balances there are always contingencies there are always things you can do during the year <e> <s> that is what all reasonable authorities do regardless of how far control changes <e> <s> that is the practicality of it <e> <s> it is quite wrong to say that after coming in with a mandate having said you would spend more on this or that service you are then prohibited from so doing <e> <s> the fact is that there is great scope within local authority finance to shuffle around from one vote head to another there is freedom to spend more or less on education housing social services or whatever you like to do despite what you might have committed yourself to spending at any moment in time <e> <s> so there is no case for the emotive argument which the noble lord makes implying that this is some great new <e>", "<cs> the noble lord raises a very interesting point and i would like to look into it carefully <e> <s> i understand that in brent for example only about of the ratepayers in the borough asked for a refund of sums paid in connection with the glc precept <e> <s> if it should be that luton and bedfordshire have a special situation that is a problem for them which involves costs of the kind the noble lord mentions i would want to have a look at it and see what the implications are <e> <s> i do not know what one could do or how to do it but i certainly accept the point and would want to see exactly what it is <e> <s> i assure the noble lord lord hill that i will do that and see what one is able to report as we go along <e>", "<cs> if it should be that an authority does privatise its refuse collection to use the example which the noble baroness gives and saves million or million i have heard the figure for birmingham talked of as million but i do not know what it is and if it should be that it provides a satisfactory level of service and saves its ratepayers some millions of pounds can the noble baroness really envisage a situation where a party would come back to power and say we do not want to make that saving <e> <s> we want to pay more <e> <s> with respect i cannot see where that would ever be likely to arise <e>", "<cs> i did say that i did not want to go into a whole debate on this matter <e> <s> however if i did do so then i would want to say one thing namely the that record so far shows in the main that where the kind of service that the noble baroness mentioned is done by the private sector the standard of service i shall say no more is every bit as good as it was <e>", "<cs> no i would not want to speculate because i know somewhere where the promise was made and it did not result in the same thing would that it had <e> <s> but it did result in some gains for what it is worth <e>", "<cs> i want to repeat what i said before <e> <s> these amendments are not specifically intended for bedfordshire county council <e> <s> your lordships should bear well in mind that my right honourable friend gave a commitment to make these amendments before bedfordshire made its decision to levy a supplementary rate <e> <s> to me that is very significant <e> <s> i shall say no more <e>", "<cs> i do not want to go yet again round the track we seem to have been circling for the last few hours <e> <s> perhaps i should comment on the general philosophical points that as the committee will be aware i by no means see the bogies that concern noble lords opposite <e> <s> there is no shortage of precedent the scottish situation does not throw up the kind of concerns that have been expressed today <e> <s> the supplementary rate as has been said was hitherto almost unknown used only in the last year or so <e> <s> it was never even contemplated before and there was no need for it despite the fact that there have for years been situations where pay and prices have been quite different from what successive governments forecast they would be <e> <s> despite all of that authorities did not have to resort to a supplementary rate nor in my view was it necessary <e>", "<cs> we debated an amendment similar to this on report and i am not sure i can add a great deal to what i said then except to repeat that this is in no way a temporary expedient <e> <s> nor is it intended to avoid the need for the fundamental reform of the domestic rating system to which i repeat we are committed <e> <s> the ban on supplementary rates and precepts could indeed therefore be an interim measure in the domestic sector pending our proposals for reform <e> <s> but as regards the commercial and industrial sector where rates will remain for the foreseeable future the ban will continue <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend would permit me but if he thinks it would be confusing of course i will not do so in speaking to this amendment no <e> <s> and to no <e> <s> to cover also amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> of course i entirely accept that <e> <s> may i say that underlying all these new clauses is the point that high rates can harm employment and development prospects in the areas where they are levied <e> <s> my noble friend has very commendably looked at ways in which the impact of these high rate levels on the business community can be reduced <e> <s> i suspect he will not be surprised that i cannot say today that the principle and the drafting of his new clauses are acceptable and that i commend them to the house <e> <s> but i should like to establish clearly and indeed i hope that all that i was saying earlier established clearly that we take very seriously the plight of commerce and industry in some areas and that we take very much to heart what is said to us on the subject by the cbi by firms and individuals and indeed by my noble friend this evening <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will not be surprised if i spring up to tell him that i too will speak as often as i like and whenever i like to defend the policies of my party <e> <s> the fact is that i disagree with him absolutely and totally <e> <s> it is not grant that decides the level of funds that are available to a local authority it is the rate at which it spends <e> <s> i can recall having served the noble lord may sneer but i can recall being in local government when our rate support grant was reduced from per cent <e> <s> down to per cent <e> <s> an enormous reduction of per cent <e> <s> the fact is that it was always those same authorities who managed who somehow ordered their affairs who did things better who got better value for money who went on providing services at a rate which did not impose upon their industry and commerce the kind of burdens that were being imposed upon them by other authorities who did not care so much about value for money and those things that some members opposite care about so little <e> <s> so when we discuss matters in this bill as we are doing and try to make progress i suggest that it helps if we do not start to make political party points because i can assure the noble lord that on this subject i know every bit as much about it as he does <e>", "<cs> i do not knock local government <e> <s> first i query very much the figures that the noble lord mentioned but apart from that i do not continually knock local government <e> <s> quite the contrary i have every bit as much interest in local government as has the noble lord some might think even more so <e> <s> but i am concerned when i see things happen within local government that i know are harming it and harming its future <e> <s> when there is this inability of central and local government to work together then it is local government as well as central government that is harmed <e> <s> at the end of the day it is central government that prevails to the detriment of local government <e> <s> i did not talk about extravagance i talked about levels of spending what we can afford and what ratepayers can afford <e> <s> the ability to pay does not come into this whole debate at all but it is certainly having its effect upon business and commerce <e> <s> it is at our peril that we fail to recognise this <e>", "<cs> i do not know about this having a bash at things it is getting very close <e> <s> of course i shall certainly write to my noble friend and we will sort out this business of commercial and industrial <e> <s> i think that we had better sort out also the particular amendments on which we are speaking because so far as i am concerned i confess that there is some confusion although i am sure that that is not the case for my noble friend he obviously knows exactly what he has in mind <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for the careful thought he has clearly given to this matter <e> <s> as he rightly says our intention has been to ensure that no doubt should arise as to the credit rating of local authorities <e> <s> money borrowed as my noble friend has said is secured as a charge on local authority revenues by the local government act <e> <s> it is not entirely clear whether interest as well as principal debt is covered by the term money borrowed although i am aware that many existing prospectuses state as much because the term interest is not specifically used <e>", "<cs> that is the point <e> <s> it is really a question of putting the interest and principal as equal charges on local authority revenues for all loans <e> <s> this removes any ambiguity that there may be in the act which in fact does not mention interest specifically and reproduces existing practices <e> <s> i understand that the money market now considers this amendment acceptable and indeed preferable to the original proposals they were making <e> <s> of course as i sit down i endorse what the noble lord lord bruce says <e> <s> it does no harm to reiterate that because as there are changes even restrictions on supplementary rates and so on people wonder sometimes worry so it does no harm to restate the position <e>", "<cs> we could spend all night discussing a point of that kind so i shall be brief <e> <s> i am sure the noble baroness lady birk is not seriously suggesting that the raising of a supplementary rate in one year would seriously affect the credit-worthiness of a local authority and the noble lord lord bruce explained how credit-worthy local authorities really were <e> <s> i agree and of course we are talking about something which has a years run <e> <s> it is a point i made it myself a few moments ago in terms of the totality of creditworthiness and i do not think i need say more <e>", "<cs> as soon as the noble lord said a good deal hangs on it i began to wonder one must double check everything in that situation and i know he would want me to do that <e> <s> my interpretation i think this touches on the point we were discussing earlier is that it is what was in effect before the date st april but i shall confirm that and contact the noble lord <e>", "<cs> as i intimated when discussing the previous amendment in the name of my noble friend lord mottistone we are in some difficulty because this <e>", "<cs> i shall not say much on this point but i believe that in all fairness it should be remembered that if a domestic ratepayer cannot afford to pay his rates he can obtain a rate rebate <e> <s> if an industrial or commercial person cannot afford to pay his rates then he must cut back his staff and his business move to another area where the rates are lower or go out of business <e> <s> so i must say in all fairness that the matter is not quite so simple as i am sure the noble lord knows <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i have to disappoint my noble friend <e> <s> i think the moth-balling relief suggestion is really a very interesting one and i know that my noble friend feels very strongly that such measures would do much to mitigate the effects of economic recession on industry and commerce <e> <s> but likewise he will know from the debates of his proposals on this subject during the progress of the local government planning and land act through your lordships house that although the government as i have said more than once this evening are more than sympathetic to the plight of businesses which are forced to shut down all or part of their premises temporarily we do not consider that this measure is one which will be workable in practice <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord says these amendments would allow clause to be used to encourage increases in local government spending as well as reduction <e> <s> as such i should have thought that they were probably unnecessary <e> <s> local authorities in my experience were never backward at coming forward when it came to increasing their expenditure <e> <s> i should have thought that these amendments were perhaps redundant in view of the noble lords great support for local government independence <e> <s> i am surprised that he is moving these amendments <e> <s> they would enable a future government to determine exactly the level of service that each authority should provide and despite the criticisms made constantly to me over the last three years that that is what we are trying to do i have argued staunchly and would argue that that is not what we are trying to do <e> <s> quite the opposite <e>", "<cs> if i may come back on this the fallacy of the point that the noble baroness makes is that it should not be the amount of money that is spent that itself decides the level of services least of all by comparison one authority with the other <e> <s> so often in the past we have fallen into that trap of deciding that an authority is profligate or the opposite parsimonious or providing a good or bad level of service on the basis of what it spends <e>", "<cs> may i intervene briefly to make just one point <e> <s> i should like to make one point very clear <e> <s> the government are not saying they will curtail spending plans at all <e> <s> what they are saying is if you spend beyond certain levels it is the grant that will be reduced because those are the levels decided whether on the basis of the grant related expenditure assessments or other criteria which we need not go into at the moment and it is the grant which is being reduced <e> <s> the authority at the end of the day still has its power if it so wishes to spend and to rate <e> <s> that is where we are today <e>", "<cs> i must confess that there is certainly confusion here <e> <s> the grouping has gone adrift and that is causing difficulties <e> <s> if the fault is on this side then i readily apologise <e> <s> it is important to get it right if we can <e>", "<cs> i should like to cover amendments nos <e> <s> and and also to comment on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i am glad to have the opportunity to discuss these amendments which are expressed in similar terms to ones which were negatived during the committee and report stages of the bill in another place <e> <s> i agree that clause is concerned with the proper relationship of central and local government and above all with central governments right to determine the overall level of public expenditure and the level of grant support provided by central taxpayers to local services <e> <s> these are important questions and i do not want to be accused of failing to address myself to them <e>", "<cs> i shall comment on the matter raised by the noble baroness in a moment <e> <s> but so that it does not slip my mind i should like to say this to the noble lord lord evans on his point about the statutory duties and his concern that of course the statutory duty is so often very flexible one decides oneself what will be its level <e> <s> it is always arguable it is open to challenge if you put it too low and conversely it could be open to challenge by those who are paying more if it was felt that it was too high <e> <s> this is a judgment which the local authorities take <e> <s> therefore in my experience it is not an exact science if i may put it that way <e> <s> also i make the point that i made earlier namely that it might be said that there is an authority which has education as a function <e>", "<cs> i said during the second reading debate it is obviously on the record that it might be necessary to introduce government amendments to ensure that the amendments introduced in another place did not by accident prevent us from making those exemptions from holdback that we had already announced for <e> <s> we are very anxious to get this right and to find a form of words which in no way goes back on assurances given by my right honourable friend in another place and which will ensure that no future government could use clause in an arbitrary or capricious way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the information that he gave me in asking the supplementary question <e> <s> he seems to know something about the zones that i do not know <e> <s> i was interested to hear what he said about the scheme for painters and decorators about which i had not heard <e> <s> so far as i am aware this is not an official scheme that comes through my department <e> <s> i will want to look at it to see the implications or possibilities that arise from it <e> <s> as to his other observations i agree that the location and siting is very important <e> <s> what we did previously was to call for applications from authorities who wanted to have zones in their areas and there were more applications than placings of zones <e> <s> what happens in future will depend upon what is being achieved <e> <s> we understand that there is some element of needing to know perhaps more quickly than might have been the case previously <e> <s> we are hoping to have the consultants report next month and we hope to be able to come out with its findings in early autumn <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks a valid question <e> <s> if what he said became the rule it would bring into question the success of the scheme <e> <s> but we have no general knowledge of this happening <e> <s> there is the odd situation and one would expect that <e> <s> if zones are to be the success that is hoped they will bring up the whole of the area and not just those which are within the zones so that everyone should benefit <e> <s> but only time will tell if this is so <e>", "<cs> i suppose that we are back to the noble lords definition of what is reasonable <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the old days i would point out that they were not so long ago <e> <s> we are talking about three years ago and i do not think that that can be termed the old days <e> <s> former days might perhaps have been a better way of putting it <e>", "<cs> i only wish the noble baroness lady stedman had come back time and again at her administration when they were in power for many years and did not do anything about the parish councils <e> <s> however the rules have changed a little <e> <s> as the noble lord lord evans explained his proposed new clause is concerned with the two matters relating to parish and community finance which have been debated in another place at an earlier stage and in your lordships house during the passage of the local government <e> <s> planning and land act <e>", "<cs> if i were to say i could or would do what the noble baroness lady birk asks i would be misleading the committee i cannot give that assurance <e> <s> i can only offer as i have though not within the context of the bill to talk to the noble lady about it <e> <s> the noble baroness lady stedman says she will not leave the matter alone but will come back to me on it time and again <e> <s> that is fine and i respect her for that and there is no reason why we should not sit down and talk about it with officials and others <e> <s> however the problems are there <e> <s> it is not that easy a matter and we cannot accept the new clause <e>", "<cs> there is no reason at all so far as i am aware why somebody should not ask for one and if they did it might be interesting because one could then see exactly where it led <e> <s> she might wish to instigate such a request but i am sure she will take great care before doing so to consider all the implications <e>", "<cs> i am sure that no one would thank us for sending the kind of strongly-worded circular that the noble lord suggests <e> <s> i am also sure that he knows that there is very strong opposition by many district councils to what is being proposed <e> <s> i can tell him that personally i have received between six and delegations from district councils which have complained bitterly that the actions of parish councils have caused them to exceed their spending targets and all the rest <e> <s> the delegations have told me of all the dreadful things that parish councils do to them <e> <s> as the noble lord and the noble baroness know some parish councils are very large and their spending is very significant while others the majority are small authorities and these i think are the ones which mostly worry the noble lord <e>", "<cs> there are so many amendments down which deal with different aspects of the membership and so on that i think i will try to deal with them as they come on their own merits rather than have a broad brush across-the-table discussion on the principles <e> <s> may i begin by saying that the independence of the commission and of those who carry out the audit is not in any way questioned <e> <s> i said at second reading that that in my opinion was vital <e> <s> it always has been vital and has always pertained it continues to be vital and it will continue to pertain and some might say to a greater extent than hitherto <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl lord gainsborough and i am sure that he will follow closely the debates which will follow on the detailed amendments will agree with me as i hope will all noble lords <e>", "<cs> to the best of my knowledge the controller answers to parliament and does not answer to a specific minister as such <e> <s> i do not think that in any way detracts from anything that i have said <e> <s> i have tried to explain that the secretary of state here is answerable to parliament and that is one of the key factors of this particular issue <e>", "<cs> it may help if i begin by saying it is worth repeating as often as necessary that the audit commission will be independent and will itself be responsible for the discharge of its functions not the secretary of state <e> <s> the secretary of state can be answerable only for the discharge of his functions in relation to the commission for example the appointment of its members so the secretary of state cannot be answerable to parliament for individual decisions of the commission <e> <s> he can be questioned only about decisions which he has made for example about persons whom he has appointed to the membership <e>", "<cs> may i thank the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby for what he has just said <e> <s> i agree very much with him <e> <s> if at the end of the day the secretary of state gets the membership out of balance if the weighting is wrong he has to answer for it to parliament <e> <s> this is the great safeguard <e> <s> local authority associations could of course nominate political appointments <e> <s> the associations must have representation and we have said all along that they will have representation on the commission <e> <s> quite clearly they need it <e> <s> however at the end of the day it will have to be the decision of the secretary of state because he is answerable if he gets it wrong <e>", "<cs> the great safeguard in respect of the latter point made by my noble friend lord ridley is the one i have been setting all along that the secretary of state will have to answer to parliament for the appointment which he makes <e> <s> in any case i am pleased to say that the government are prepared to accept at least the spirit of this amendment <e> <s> we do not regard it as essential since we believe that clause already provides for consultation on the chairmanship in that there must be consultation on the membership and the chairman must be appointed from among the members <e> <s> but i accept that this does not put the secretary of state under a clear duty to consult about the chairman which this amendment does <e>", "<cs> may i say briefly because we do not want to go over the whole subject once again that the noble baroness will expect that i entirely disagree with just about everything she has just said <e> <s> when she talks about it being an increase of central control over local government i do not see what on earth this has to do with that <e> <s> are we to have another second reading debate when one spells out the philosophies the motivations behind this part of the bill as i did at some length on second reading <e> <s> clearly this is not the time to do that <e>", "<cs> perhaps if the noble baroness had listened to me with the same attention with which i listened to her she might have known <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might also follow the noble lord lord bruce in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> and covering the others that he mentioned <e> <s> i agree with him that they are very much of a kin <e> <s> can i say at once that i have sympathy with what the noble lord seeks to do because while not liking the commission once it is in being he wants to see it working as best it can <e> <s> i preface my remarks by saying that <e>", "<cs> i think i should say one or two more things in answer specifically to my noble friend lord ridley <e> <s> so far as concerns the basic philosophy underlining this matter i am as jealous about the repu <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should interrupt the noble lord to correct a point namely that it is not the secretary of state but the audit commission who will be appointing auditors <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can help the noble lord lord bruce of donington on this latter point because to put it briefly we do feel that this is covered <e> <s> we would say that it is implicit in common law and in particular i will quote the case known as <e>", "<cs> yes i did <e> <s> i have tried to deal with this rather briefly but i am anxious to give the noble lord the assurance which he very fairly requires on a matter of this kind <e> <s> the fact is if i can take the provisions in order that the first provision would require local authorities to comply with the accounts regulations and all other statutory requirements <e> <s> the committee does not need me to dwell on the point that statutory requirements must be observed and do not need other statutory requirements to say so <e> <s> i would suggest that there is here an element of tautology <e>", "<cs> i entirely understand the way the noble lord is bringing this forward and i will want to read what he has said <e> <s> perhaps i can help a little at the moment by saying that clause mentions that the audit commission will be drawing up a code of practice and that may be one move in that direction <e> <s> i think also that clause gives the secretary of state the power to make provision with regard to the form of the accounts <e> <s> that is another area which we will want to look at before i come back to the noble lord on it <e>", "<cs> this is an interesting amendment and i am obliged to the noble baroness for highlighting the relevant issue carefully <e> <s> i feel i am not persuaded by the arguments which run contrary to the governments policy and also it seems to me in some ways contrary to some of the views that were expressed earlier on today from the opposition benches <e>", "<cs> i confess that i found this amendment a little confusing on reading it <e> <s> perhaps i should very briefly begin by describing what the relevant parts of clause are designed to achieve <e> <s> clause of the bill deals with the code of audit practice <e> <s> in response to representations in another place and in view of the importance of the code to the audit process the government agreed that it would be right for the code to be subject to parliamentary approval both initially and thereafter at intervals <e> <s> clause makes the necessary provision <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness has said this amendment deals with the code of audit practice <e> <s> this is an important issue and i am obliged to the noble baroness for this amendment which allows me to say a few words about the code which i hope will be helpful to her and her friends to whom she referred <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce for what he has said <e> <s> certainly i shall want to discuss it with colleagues and we shall read it carefully <e> <s> i assure him on that point <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord mottistone and the noble lord lord houghton made much of the case that i wanted to make <e> <s> i will say to the noble lord lord bruce that as with all the other things he is going to say on these technical matters i shall want to look at everything he has said <e> <s> one or two observations on this amendment i must make <e> <s> first the amendment would delete the requirement that the auditor should satisfy himself that the proper practice has been observed in the compilation of the accounts <e> <s> the noble lord says that they may have no place in companies act audits but they have long had a place in local government audit <e> <s> i think that it would be a retrograde step to remove it <e> <s> it seems to me a reasonable requirement indeed a minimal requirement representing one of the basic steps in the audit process <e> <s> i cannot see advantage in its removal from the auditors duties <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby said that this should not be a debate between the front benches but this part of the front bench has not been able to speak as of yet but is glad of the opportunity now to do so <e>", "<cs> as we have heard this amendment is concerned with a matter of great importance the auditor and politics <e> <s> i recognise that the noble lord is concerned that the auditor might become involved in politics but i would repeat what i said in our second reading debate that that is neither the intention nor in the governments view the effect of this legislation <e> <s> i also mentioned in our second reading debate the statement which my right honourable friend the minister made in another place on the role of the government auditor <e> <s> the minister sought to make it clear that the auditor should not be concerned with the merits of local authority decisions on any political basis and that this would continue under the proposed audit commission <e> <s> a local government auditors task is to consider whether items of account are lawful and whether the accounts are properly prepared <e>", "<cs> i must say that i feel uneasy about these amendments <e> <s> an amendment on similar lines was discussed in another place and my right honourable friend there sought to make it clear that local authorities do indeed already have a duty to seek value for money <e> <s> the fact that it is not embodied in statute does not make it any less real <e> <s> it is a common law obligation and there are a number of relevant cases <e> <s> i referred earlier to <e>", "<cs> one might say there is no point in not doing so <e> <s> i recognise that the amendment echoes the provision of the companies act <e> <s> i can see there might at first sight be an argument for applying it to local authorities <e> <s> i am sure that one can only agree that making false statements to auditors is not to be encouraged but condemned <e> <s> as the noble lord said as he sat down it has not been a problem in the past and i wonder why we should impose it now <e> <s> i agree with him that we are not saying that standards of truthfulness among local government officers have fallen so low so suddenly <e> <s> i think that is the position <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i must get on the record that of course i did not say that at all <e> <s> what i have all along been concerned about is that it is the procedures this is the point i have tried to stress about which we have to be careful not the individuals <e> <s> if the procedures are properly investigated properly the province of the auditors then we will know that matters will be looked at properly <e> <s> i did not set out nor did any who have spoken earlier to speak about individuals as such <e> <s> it was the opportunities that were there which must be watched carefully because that is the duty and that is the public interest <e>", "<cs> i think i understand exactly what the noble lord is trying to do and he is trying to be helpful in this <e> <s> concerning amendments nos <e> <s> d and e i should like to have another look at them <e> <s> mention has been made of tabling amendments at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble baroness is saying and she makes a fair point <e> <s> the problem is the great pressure of business <e> <s> we attempt always to meet the wishes of all interested parties to listen to what is said at different stages and to bring that all together but that puts a strain on the whole system in such a way that sometimes we get the sort of situation which the noble baroness not unfairly describes <e> <s> i will not make what might be called defensive points there would be no point in my doing that because basically she is right and all we can do is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will appreciate my reluctance to give an interpretation of the measure in answer to the sort of question he asks <e> <s> perhaps he will permit me to contact him privately on the matter and of course he will be able to return to it at a later stage if he is unhappy with the reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the reasons which have motivated the tabling of the amendments but i fear that the government cannot accept them <e> <s> the intention which is clearly expressed in the side note to the new clause though i must draw to your lordships attention the governments view that the proposed new clause is inconsistent with its apparent intention is that part of the costs incurred by local authorities on apprentice training should be excluded from the accounts of those authorities direct labour organisations <e> <s> i must make it clear that while the government are concerned to see training programmes maintained throughout the construction industry we are not persuaded that it would be right to exclude any part of apprentice training costs from a local authoritys dlo accounts <e> <s> we consider as do the construction industry firms with which dlos are in competition that such costs are an integral part of the costs that have to be borne by any organisation carrying out construction and maintenance work and that on those grounds alone it would be quite wrong to exclude them from dlo accounts <e>", "<cs> my lords this minister is attending <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point that the noble baroness is making about the procedural way of dealing with this matter but she may find it helpful to have on the record what the government now feel about the position <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord lord evans said i feel obliged to make some comment on it and i do so as follows <e> <s> even if the amendment were to be put forward at this moment the government could not accept it <e> <s> perhaps it will assist if i say briefly but i hope clearly how the government see the position <e> <s> i immediately say that there is much legality in this matter as the noble lord lord evans said <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly write to the noble baroness about her particular query and i will also at the same time take the opportunity to look into the last point she makes about expense and so on <e> <s> perhaps i could do the two together and then she could decide what she wishes to do at the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords may i deal first with amendment no <e> <s> zb <e> <s> the government cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> it is not considered to be necessary <e> <s> as i intimated when the noble baroness lady david moved a somewhat similar amendment in committee the clause will take effect whenever property comes into the possession of a local authority after being found in buildings or on premises owned or managed by them <e> <s> whether such property was lost deliberately abandoned or simply left on the premises is irrelevant <e> <s> it is the fact of its being found and taken into the possession of a local authority that is germane to the clause <e> <s> however the noble baroness will no doubt be pleased to hear me say that the government are prepared to consider amendment no <e> <s> za with a view to tabling suitable amendments at third reading <e> <s> the points which the noble baroness makes and has made have we feel merit but it is a question of bringing this forward in the best way possible as i am sure the noble baroness will appreciate <e> <s> in those circumstances i hope that she will feel able to withdraw her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness allow me to refer to that last point first while it is in my mind <e> <s> i really do not know the answer to what the noble lord lord evans says <e> <s> it sounds very reasonable as does most of what the noble lord says <e> <s> would that we could always agree unhappily we rarely do it would seem <e> <s> clearly this is an area where one is <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for an interesting amendment which touches on the important matter as he said of the exercise by local authorities of discretion in the exercise of their powers <e> <s> the committee will be aware that authorities may be challenged for the unreasonable exercise of discretion if they fail to comply with what is known as the <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> in the group of amendments would make the fee scale which the commission is required to draw up advisory rather than mandatory and i agree that this is an important point <e> <s> the problem is that an advisory fee scale would require the commission or its auditor to negotiate fees in each case and if the committee thinks carefully about that it will see that it would create several problems <e> <s> it would lead to uncertainty about the commissions income <e> <s> it would jeopardise sensible budgeting <e> <s> it might well lead to pressure to cut audit standards as a result of what might be considered short-sighted attempts to decrease audit fees <e> <s> negotiating the fee in each and every case would be quite an undertaking <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that this was a probing amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether i may give him a probing answer <e> <s> i listened very carefully to what he said and i found it helpful because when i first looked at the amendment i was not clear as to the precise objective in putting it down <e> <s> it might help because one wants to be sure that one is not missing a point here if i explain the way in which we see the audit fee mechanism working <e>", "<cs> so far as the extraordinary audit is concerned may i say that there have been powers in this country to direct extraordinary audits since so they are nothing new <e> <s> nevertheless i understand that local government is concerned about the secretary of states powers in respect of the audit commission <e> <s> i would suggest however that the concern is misplaced not least in the case of the power which we are considering namely the power to require extraordinary audits <e> <s> the power is a proper one <e> <s> it means that the secretary of state will be able to respond positively should some matter of public concern arise about a local authoritys financial affairs <e> <s> in such cases one might expect the audit commission themselves to respond by directing an extraordinary audit <e> <s> i would expect this almost always to be so <e>", "<cs> the secretary of state already has these powers <e> <s> the fact that there will be an audit commission means that the commission will have the power to continue this process <e> <s> the secretary of states position is a fallback position to cover the point i mentioned earlier about the parliamentary questions which may be asked <e> <s> if we were introducing for the first time an extraordinary audit it would be a different matter but there is nothing new about this <e>", "<cs> i could not help but compare the very reasoned way in which my noble friend proposed the amendment and the very drastic way in which the <e>", "<cs> this is certainly a reasonable amendment but i wonder whether the noble lord lord bruce will still feel that it is necessary when i point out that i entirely accept that the secretary of state should be under a duty to consult the accountancy profession about the regulations on accounts which he is empowered to make under clause <e> <s> i almost hesitate to suggest it but i wonder whether the noble lord has missed clause of the bill which provides that <e>", "<cs> quite clearly i shall read what the noble lord has said and discuss it with colleagues <e> <s> if it is felt that that would be the right way to go one would want to do something about it <e> <s> as the noble lord knows i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> the government feel that we cannot accept these amendments <e> <s> it may be said that the commission will see the value of these comparative studies and will be bound to carry them out <e> <s> some of your lordships may argue and indeed it has been said that the word shall in line imposing a duty is therefore unnecessary <e> <s> i agree that the commission will be likely to conduct these kinds of studies whether or not it has an express duty to do so <e> <s> but we feel that this provision is so crucial to the value for money audit that we want to encourage that the government believe it necessary to put in this safeguard of giving the commission a duty to make absolutely certain that the studies are carried out <e> <s> furthermore giving the commission a duty would underline the importance attached to these studies by both the government and parliament <e> <s> we feel that these studies are a crucial element in our proposal to increase the amount of value for money audit work undertaken <e> <s> it is essential that the studies are carried out and clause ensures this <e> <s> the amendment would not and that really is why we cannot accept it <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree <e> <s> i think that that is right <e> <s> i think the way we have put them together here has not been right <e> <s> i understood that that had been agreed but clearly it had not <e>", "<cs> we have been talking about two clauses but i must say first of all that the new clause contained in amendment no <e> <s> h is quite a different matter <e> <s> there is a connection but no more than that because the purpose of each clause is different <e> <s> clause is intended to enable the commission to make recommendations for improving value for money in local authorities but the new clause requires the commission to look at the effects of government policy on local authorities and that is designed to strengthen ministerial accountability to parliament <e> <s> the two clauses are not at all concerned with the same thing <e>", "<cs> no i have not finished i have quite a way to go yet <e> <s> i am in full cry <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk quoted mr maynard the chairman of the committee in a letter he wrote to the secretary of state and she emphasised the point that maynard had said that the prime responsibility and that is the key word for this kind of work must be with the elected members <e> <s> he was absolutely right i agree with him <e> <s> the prime responsibility is with the elected members but who actually does the work and how they are helped to ensure that there is value for money this is what this proposal is about <e>", "<cs> i know mr maynard very well and most able he certainly is but i think he would only be able to pick up observations made by people <e> <s> i cannot comment on what claims are or are not made by anyone but i can comment on what i actually know and that is the basis of my remarks now <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me i want to comment now <e> <s> i feel that i have finished what i want to say in general and in any case soon we shall be back on a not dissimilar point <e> <s> as far as i am aware it is that the auditor is to be satisfied as to the arrangements <e> <s> certainly that is an obligation on the auditor <e> <s> but i wonder if everybody knows that what is being called for is that the auditor if he wishes to publish a report and he may decide after consultation with the authority that he does not wish to do so shall publish a report which will make certain recommendations <e> <s> that is what it is about recommendations as to ways in which things might be improved done better <e> <s> that is what he will be doing <e> <s> in such recommendations there is nothing sinister nothing that calls for a heavy hand <e> <s> it is to set out what he discovers in his report <e>", "<cs> i should like to say just a brief word because i do not want to go over the whole debate <e> <s> your lordships will be aware that the new clause which is proposed in amendment no <e> <s> h has been tabled i say it again and i hope that everyone understands it in response to proposals in another place where they attach great importance to it <e> <s> the word shall is more appropriate than the word may because it places a positive requirement on the commission and that reflects the significance with which these studies are to be regarded <e> <s> we have already discussed whether to make a similar change of wording in connection with the studies which are to be conducted under clause and i should have thought that the same considerations applied in this case <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether i fully understood the point being made by my noble friend <e> <s> perhaps i may come to them in a moment <e> <s> but simply <e>", "<cs> may i say that the new clause does not require the commission to study all aspects of value for money and the impact of government policies <e> <s> it is for the commission to decide how many studies to do and what subjects to cover but and this is the point after consultation <e> <s> the inclusion of the word shall does not mean that it has to study the whole field only that it must do some studies <e> <s> it is nothing like so severe imposing or sinister as the noble lord lord bruce fears <e> <s> it is all about accountability <e>", "<cs> not for the first nor i suspect for the last time do i find myself on my own over this matter <e> <s> i listened carefully to what my noble friend had to say but i truly think that the fears which he and others have expressed are not real fears <e> <s> i do not think that their concern is justified <e> <s> local authorities will have nothing to lose from being identified in the commissions reports <e> <s> those authorities which come out well in reports will certainly welcome the publicity while those which do not compare so favourably will probably be spurred on to do better <e> <s> we believe that the provision of more information about the activities of local authorities is an important part of the policy of improving the accountability of local authorities <e> <s> this can only be of benefit to the reputation of local government as a whole <e>", "<cs> the principle of comparison is absolutely clear <e> <s> it does not matter by what route the authority pays for its services <e> <s> it is the principle that matters here <e> <s> if it is buying them by contracting out the same applies as if they were being done in-house by direct labour or whatever <e> <s> there is no difference in principle it is right or it is wrong <e>", "<cs> yes i think that is right <e>", "<cs> clearly there is a misunderstanding here <e> <s> i said and i repeat it gladly for the record that the comptroller and auditor-general does not have the right of access himself to individual authorities but that is not to say that he cannot use any published information <e> <s> there is nothing to stop him from using published information and therefore he can use information published under clause by the commission as can anyone else use that information <e> <s> if my noble friend fears that that is a possible loophole of concern then i will undertake to have a look at the matter to ensure that that is not so because that is not the intention <e> <s> although i say that i must state again that the comptroller and auditor-general has access to anything that is published and so he should and no one would quarrel with that <e> <s> certainly i undertake to look at this to ensure that it is quite clear and that we are in the bill carrying out the governments intention <e> <s> that i undertake to do <e>", "<cs> i am glad to give my noble friend this information <e> <s> first of all the new clause does not make local government answerable either to parliament or to the commission <e> <s> local government is answerable to its electorate and this is in no way altered by the bill <e> <s> on the second point the clause empowers studies on the effect of existing legislation and guidance <e> <s> it is concerned with effects and there cannot therefore be studies before the legislation concerned is enacted <e>", "<cs> may i say that in some ways i hope we shall not do that because at the end of the day we have to come to conclusions about this <e> <s> i understand exactly what the noble lord lord evans was saying and the concern of my noble friend and all others who have spoken on this matter <e> <s> they know how i feel about it <e> <s> this debate really is about one word it is about accountability <e> <s> i do not ever see why anybody in local government at any level is afraid of accountability <e> <s> the councils i know are not afraid of accountability <e> <s> they are proud of what they do <e> <s> in the main they do a good job and they do not mind if people want to know what kind of a job they are doing <e> <s> if someone points out to them that somebody else is doing the same thing better the first thing they will say is tell me <e> <s> id like to do the same thing <e> <s> they see nothing wrong in that <e> <s> that is not an imposition on local government or an inquisition on local government <e> <s> the only thing we are talking about here is accountability and it can only be to the good of local government to be as open as possible and let everything be as open as it can be <e> <s> let anyone <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way i should like to point out that that is not a word which i use lightly <e> <s> i am sure that i would not have used it in that sense <e>", "<cs> i should dearly love to be able to meet the noble lord on this but i fear that yet again he would say i am unable to do so <e> <s> it seems to me to be very important that there should be protection against wrongful disclosure of information <e> <s> the auditor will be in a very specialised privileged position and it is right that there should be penalites against abuse of that position <e> <s> in no way do i detract from what the noble lord said about the profession which has the highest possible standing and standard <e> <s> there is no question about that at all i must make that clear <e>", "<cs> the effect of this group of amendments would be to remove the london transport executive from the bill <e> <s> i therefore cannot accept them <e> <s> london transport is a trading body and therefore rather different from local authorities themselves <e> <s> but the government believe it is appropriate that trading bodies owned by local authorities or forming part of their activities should be audited under the commission <e> <s> lte is essentially a trading body responsible to the glc in carrying out its functions and the glc is responsible for supporting it financially to the extent that it cannot meet the full cost of providing an appropriate level of services <e> <s> this is similar to all other major local authority-owned trading services such as airports harbours ptes and municipal bus companies <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce is very persuasive but what can i do <e> <s> the committee will appreciate that we are discussing what is basically a matter of judgment <e> <s> the government view is that the regulations made under part iii namely the regulations on audit fees the keeping of accounts the audit of subsidiaries of ptes and the transitional arrangements are most appropriately dealt with under the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> the noble lord is right to say that they are important matters <e> <s> if we imposed a duty on both houses to discuss them that could be at the expense of something more important <e> <s> in the government view the negative resolution procedure is the most appropriate for those matters and i trust the amendment will not be pressed <e> <s> if the noble lord feels very strongly about it i will take it away and discuss it with colleagues but i must say that at present that is felt the most appropriate way of dealing with the regulations <e> <s> he made an important point about the general concern that was expressed earlier <e> <s> that is not an unimportant point and while therefore i cannot accept the amendment i would undertake to discuss it with colleagues <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the fact that some of the local authority associations and accountancy bodies have misgivings about the secretary of states power of direction because they fear that it will undermine the independence of the commission but as i said when we earlier discussed this question i am quite satisfied that the fears are exaggerated <e> <s> the fact is that in legislating to set up non-departmental bodies of this nature successive governments have taken powers to give directions <e> <s> i shall not bore the committee by reciting a list of recent examples but suffice to say that it includes nationalised industries and as the noble lord lord northfield will know it also includes new town development corporations and the commission for local authority accounts in scotland <e>", "<cs> i trust the noble lord will attend our ministers meeting in the morning <e> <s> there is no need for me to do so he presents his point so well <e> <s> of course i listened as i always do with interest to what he said in moving these amendments but i feel that once more we are not in agreement <e> <s> i recognise that there should be two essential elements in any direction-making process first that directions are publicised before they are given second that parliament has an adequate opportunity to question ministers about directions <e> <s> i submit that both these elements are in fact achieved in paragraph as at present drafted <e>", "<cs> i recognise that amendments nos <e> <s> and are in line with earlier ones tabled by my noble friend lord ridley which would have removed from the secretary of state the power to appoint the members of the commission <e> <s> if the secretary of <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble baroness will swallow the fact that someone may want to be appointed for five years <e> <s> what is the magic about three <e> <s> it is very common for there to be appointments for more than three years <e> <s> i can think of several public appointments made for five years <e> <s> when i quoted two what we are saying is that there is no magic about three <e> <s> there is nothing sacrosanct about three <e>", "<cs> the commission will receive their money by way of income from the fees charged <e> <s> the real answer to my noble friends concern about an extra burden of cost being put on to local government is that if the concept is right and clearly government <e>", "<cs> i listened to the passion with which the noble lord speaks on behalf of my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i would question the reference to honesty i do not think he meant it in the way that it sounded <e> <s> it would seem that as far as the noble lord is concerned i have to accept the amendment otherwise in some way but i had better not go further down that road had i <e> <s> this is the last item in this section of the bill and it has been a tortuous one because there has been so much detail and it has taken us so long to get through that i suppose it is understandable that a little irritation as we come to the end is really inevitable <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness should not have ordered the eggs in the first place <e>", "<cs> i cannot comment on that now i am afraid but i will certainly discuss it with my colleagues and i hope they would but certainly we will talk about that <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend knows despite the way i put it that if i said that i shall do exactly that and i am glad to say that to the noble lord lord harris <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into a committee on recommitment on clause <e>", "<cs> i am far from sure that i can assuage the concern of the noble lord lord evans in the matter but let me try <e> <s> we have another opportunity to discuss this amendment we seem to have been around this track before which the noble lord expressed in similar terms to one which was negatived in the report stage of the bill in another place <e> <s> i agree that clause is concerned with the proper relationship of central and local government and above all with central governments right to determine the overall level of public expenditure and the level of grant support provided by central government taxpayers to local services <e> <s> these are important questions and i am certainly glad of the opportunity to address myself to them <e>", "<cs> the extempore parts could not have been the same <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord northfield will not find what i am about to say anything that he can quickly put his hand to but first let me say that i entirely accept not only what he says although i want to answer the points he has made but also the way in which he has said it <e> <s> the noble lord is always constructive so far as i am concerned and i think he knows that too <e> <s> i would have to pick the noble lord up on some of the points he made <e> <s> certainly the relationship is not as good as one would like it to be at the present time <e>", "<cs> i will not go on at length <e> <s> i entirely accept the thesis of everything the noble lord was saying <e> <s> he was hoping that after all this is through there will be a better relationship and i too desperately hope that will be so <e> <s> it will certainly come from the governments side <e> <s> it is no part of our plan in any way that friction and unhappiness of this kind should always go on <e> <s> that is no part of what we want to do <e> <s> we have do to do everything possible to avoid that and i give an assurance that we will <e>", "<cs> i should like to know where we stand in terms of the order of business <e> <s> the noble barness has made a really good speech <e> <s> i understand how she was manoeuvred into this situation but perhaps we could have some clarity <e> <s> i think that in fairness as amendment no <e> <s> is a government amendment i should like to speak to it first and then if necessary after others have spoken have the chance to reply <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord evans would first tell us where we stand on his amendments <e>", "<cs> i want to make one further brief comment which i feel i must make in all fairness <e> <s> my noble friend lord ridley is speaking for the county councils and i hope that he clearly understands the implications of exactly what it is that he proposes to vote against <e> <s> i understand that in there were authorities including shire counties which stood to gain a gre exemption for <e> <s> if the amendment is defeated they are at risk of losing the whole of that money and i hope that my noble friend realises that <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a last word because i suspect that the situation is still not understood <e> <s> the amendment is about exemption <e> <s> it can be used only to reduce the instance of hold-back it cannot increase it <e> <s> it does not go against any of the undertakings that we have given quite the reverse <e> <s> we need it to fulfil them <e>", "<cs> my lords the government explained their position fully on this matter in committee on report and in correspondence with the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> the new approach if i may call it that does not change our view <e> <s> in the short time available for consideration of this amendment i confess that i am doubtful as to the precise effect of its drafting <e>", "<cs> my lords some do and some do not <e> <s> i know that to be the case <e> <s> i should have thought that we were here trying to deal with the total situation as it will be in the future to cover all authorities <e> <s> if evidence is required in support of what i am saying it should be noted that no fewer than eight local authority rationalisation bills have included powers to enable the authorities in these different county areas to enter into contracts of insurance against risks to their voluntary assistants <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may join in the noble baroness tempts me very much but i shall try to resist <e> <s> i clearly understand what my noble friend is saying and i have much sympathy with the philosophy behind it but in practical terms the government could not accept these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend and your lordships would allow me to comment on what has just been said by my noble friend <e> <s> this power has been in existence for very many years <e> <s> it is not a new power which we are talking about <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that this power to spend a p rate has existed since <e> <s> however i am open to correction on that <e> <s> the debate is about how authorities use it <e> <s> what we have done in the bill is to clarify certain aspects of it which were uncertain <e> <s> there can never be any harm in doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords the words which the amendments propose to substitute would not affect the meaning of clause f and in the government view would not improve the drafting <e> <s> they would not in any way alter the definition of the amount in question whether it be termed standard or appropriate and would not affect the limitation on the powers of councils to charge individuals for permission to provide amenities <e> <s> the noble baroness may have introduced the amendments to overcome an apprehension that the standard amount may be taken to mean a fixed identical amount in every case <e> <s> i gladly assure her that such an apprehension is ill-founded subsection makes it quite clear what the term means <e> <s> the term the standard amount is the amount beyond which councils may not charge unless they are the owners of the subsoil beneath the part of the highway where an amenity is proposed to be provided <e> <s> i hope that with that additional explanation and clarification she will feel somewhat happier and be able to withdraw the amendments <e>", "<cs> so far as i am aware my lords the same answer applies although as with the last series of amendments we are now into legal definitions <e> <s> subject to any correction i may later wish to send the noble baroness my interpretation is that the same would apply to a scale of charges <e> <s> i do not think her concern is necessary and unless i come back to her on the matter that is the answer <e> <s> i do not think there is any difference between the two and it might help further if i said that no scale is envisaged and the charges will of course vary from case to case <e>", "<cs> my lords the government see no reason to delete the words specified in amendment no <e> <s> and substitute new subsection <e> <s> the present clause uses words with which local authorities are familiar in other public general acts <e> <s> subsection of amendment no <e> <s> is defective <e> <s> subsection of clause j provides that where a person fails to reply within a certain time to a notice seeking his consent to a proposed amenity he will be treated as having unreasonably withheld his consent <e> <s> the council will then be free to provide the amenity <e> <s> the purpose of the clause is to protect the council from the prospect of a veto on its proposals as a result of frontagers choosing not to read letters seeking their consent or not bothering to reply <e> <s> in all other cases where consent is withheld or is granted subject to conditions any question of whether the withholding is unreasonable or the conditions are unreasonable is determinable by arbitration <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will study carefully what i have said she will see that the answer to that question is yes <e> <s> in effect what we are saying is that no reply equals no arbitration <e> <s> that is really what we are saying <e>", "<cs> my lords in its present form subsection which provides that a council shall pay the expenses and remuneration of the arbitrator ensures that a council will not trouble a frontager unnecessarily by lightly seeking arbitration <e> <s> a council will be unlikely to wish to proceed to this stage unless it has a fair chance of success and there is a measure of public interest involved <e> <s> the individual will not face the risk of having to pay all costs and expenses should the council decide to go to arbitration and will therefore be in a position to ask for conditions to be attached to his consent without fear of bearing all the expenses of arbitration <e> <s> conversely the council will be in a position where it may be more amenable to accept consents subject to conditions <e> <s> the provision is precedented by the british telecommunications act and in my view strikes a reasonable balance between the interests of councils and those whose consent is sought <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there is merit in what the noble baroness says and that the intention is to do just as she proposes <e> <s> i hope that that will give her the assurance that she seeks <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may with the leave of the house speak again may i say that if one looks at the basic intention behind what we are proposing it is in any case to take up the very point that my noble friend lord ridley made namely that if we did not have supplementary rates and precepts then there would not be a problem such as we are finding now to put the situation back into shape satisfactorily <e> <s> of course that is the governments intention and we make it quite clear that we wish to see the abolition of the right to impose supplementary rates and precepts <e> <s> once that has been done presumably on this bill receiving royal assent then the problem will not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i come to speak yet a third time other than to say that to the best of my knowledge in no way would that be a problem <e>", "<cs> i rise for the fourth time my lords to say that quite clearly i would prefer this to be dealt with at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say first of all that we consider this is a helpful proposal and i am grateful to my noble friend lord gainford <e> <s> the intention here extends the protection afforded by clause and schedule to those ratepayers who do not pay their rates directly to the rating authority but pay them instead as an addition to or as part of the rent payment to their landlord <e> <s> clearly since the bill as it stands gives the landlord if he is a direct ratepayer a right to recover excess payments it is only fair that these should be passed on to the tenant if he originally footed the bill <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that there can be no contention over that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble baroness wishes to wreck the package of amendments which the government tabled tabled may i remind her after full consultation with the local authority associations at committee stage <e> <s> i do not propose to repeat all that i said when the house discussed the issues on that occasion but i thought made it clear that the package was designed to clarify the position of rating and precepting authorities and of ratepayers especially where a rate or precept was found to be unlawful <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i could say that there is some evidence of what the noble baroness says that in some instances rents in some zones have tended in some cases to be higher than one might have expected or one might have anticipated <e> <s> we shall have to watch this <e> <s> it is all part <e>", "<cs> my lords the first amendment that we dealt with today the one by the noble lord lord hill of luton touched on this area <e> <s> i then made the government position clear and i think i indicated our attitude to this bedfordshire situation by the decision we took to accept that amendment <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and are designed to ensure that the anomalous situation and that is what it is in bedfordshire persists after royal assent <e> <s> as the house is aware the county council issued this supplementary precept in march for <e> <s> as the bill stands it will be invalidated on royal assent and the rating authorities and the bedfordshire ratepayers will get their money back <e> <s> under the amendments it will remain valid and the rating authorities and the ratepayers will be unable to get their money back <e> <s> at least i am pleased to see that noble lords opposite have at last acknowledged that these words that they wish to delete and which i must say have been in the bill from the beginning although originally part of clauses and make it clear that the bill applies to any actions taken in relation to the financial year whether or not they took place before st april <e> <s> that must be right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i thought that was so but perhaps i should say a word on the point now because the noble baroness raised it and the noble lord lord evans also touched on the principles <e> <s> we have made it clear on a number of occasions that clauses and will retrospectively invalidate any supplementary rates and precepts made for whether before or after st april and therefore bedfordshires supplementary precept will fall on royal assent <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i welcome the grouping together in this way although i think that amendment no <e> <s> of my noble friend lord ridley is slightly different <e> <s> therefore the noble baroness will understand if i do not touch on that but reserve my remarks on it until my noble friend moves it <e> <s> while i will gladly comment upon amendments nos <e> <s> and together i suppose it ought fairly to be said that in a way the amendments are alternatives as i am sure the noble baroness appreciates <e>", "<cs> my lords may i with the leave of the house say that i understand absolutely what the noble lord lord evans of claughton has said <e> <s> in an attempt to try to get the kind of certainty to which he refers i submit that one would have to give up the flexibility to manoeuvre which would be of benefit to local authorities <e> <s> what the noble lord has said is true it could be abused <e> <s> i believe however that it is vitally important that the flexibility should be retained <e> <s> the examples of the exemptions which have been given illustrate what would happen if we were to specify only those things <e> <s> there may even be changes to those exemptions which i agree adds to the uncertainty <e> <s> nevertheless so long as local government knows the position before it starts its rate-making procedure my right honourable friend in another place conceded this point and that is why we made the changes which we did i feel that there is no need to <e>", "<cs> well my lords talk about coming under pressure from all sides but not for the first time on these matters <e> <s> may i say first that i appreciate the way in which my noble friend lord ridley put his amendment just as i would have expected of him <e> <s> indeedfor that matter although i want to comment on one or two of the specific points the noble lord lord bruce made he too put it from where he sees it fairly enough <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly the point i made about the present is absolutely critical but i thought that the philosophy of what i was saying applied in general <e> <s> what we need and what we get from this subsection is the right to be able to give exemptions when the unforeseen the unpredictable comes about <e> <s> that is all it is <e> <s> that is why frankly i am astonished that the acc powers-that-be are unwilling to see that that is what it means <e> <s> we are at one stage from the last stage of this bill and i hope that my noble friend will perhaps again at least read what i say and again discuss with his colleagues whether we are right or wrong <e> <s> if he can convince us that we are wrong then of course we will listen but i assure him that we have thought deeply about this because we had a division on it last time and we do not take those things lightly <e> <s> we feel that the principle of the right to be able to give these benefits should the need arise is fundamental at any time <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have some sympathy with the objective here and i myself am absolutely committed to openness accountability to explanation and so on at all levels of government <e> <s> i believe we cannot have too much of it <e> <s> many of the measures which we passed in the act were directed in that way and much of what we are talking about through the audit commission and so on and much of the requirement now for the greater presentation in accounts is all in that direction and i am in favour of it <e> <s> therefore in terms of the philosophy behind this amendment i am not against that but there are problems here <e>", "<cs> my lords i too shall not say too much about this because as i am sure the noble lord recognises the amendment strikes not only at the heart of the holdback proposals but at the governments duty under section of the act to determine the aggregate amount of rate support grants <e> <s> as i said a few moments ago on another amendment this is <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment too on the face of it is very straightforward and it would mean as the noble lord lord evans said that holdback could not be implemented for or <e> <s> may i preface the relatively few remarks i want to make on this by saying yet again that the governments position is clear <e> <s> we cannot turn away from the overspending in those two years and the amounts in question are just too great <e> <s> furthermore as i have been saying on the last two or three amendments without the powers to implement differential holdback provided by clause the government would be forced by the general economic situation and the action of some authorities to implement an across-the-board holdback scheme <e> <s> this would affect all authorities regardless of their individual performance <e> <s> i say again that i cannot believe that this is what most authorities want <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord evans is not in his place because i should like him to have heard me say that this is one amendment for which i do not have sympathy and which does not appeal to mc <e> <s> yet again i feel i have to remind your lordships that the government amendment was a correction of a drafting error or more accurately an error that arose as a result of the passage of time since the clause was first drafted <e> <s> subsection of the clause provides that references to guidance are to include references to guidance issued before the passage of the act <e> <s> the government amendment agreed by the committee extended this provision to include the guidance issued in relation to which was actually issued last february <e> <s> the amendment now before us would take us back to the position whereby references to guidance issued before the passage of the act referred only to that issued in respect of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lords suggestion that he may have to return to the charge is a threat or a promise <e> <s> when he said that he may have to do more vigorously well he was not doing so badly this time was he <e> <s> i think he does himself less than justice when he talks about my having afterthoughts <e> <s> there was he the great advocate asking will you take this away to consider it <e> <s> will you look at it again <e> <s> and when we do so and come forward with something he then complains that we are having afterthoughts <e> <s> the noble lord really cannot have it both ways and must make his mind up on what it is he really wants <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start by thanking my noble friend not only for what she has said and the clear way in which she said it but for the brevity with which she said it which is most appreciated at this hour <e> <s> this is as she said a complex series of technical amendments moved on behalf of the london boroughs association <e> <s> they follow a similar one moved during report stage in another place <e> <s> my honourable friend the under-secretary of state said on that occasion that although he could not accept the new clause then proposed he would look at it closely and consider the problem that had been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit that the amendment to amendment no <e> <s> does go some way towards removing some of the objections which i voiced <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not work every time <e> <s> may i begin again at the beginning with the original amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the question of membership of the audit commission has been very thoroughly debated during the passage of this bill both in your lordships house and in another place <e> <s> perhaps there is now an element of repetitiveness about the discussion but of course that only reflects the importance quite properly which everyone attaches to this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not feel like a brick wall and i am sure that my noble friend is not banging <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not consider that the amendment is nit-picking or that what the noble lord says is nit-picking <e> <s> the point he raises is a fair one and it is important <e> <s> but i wonder whether it would be helpful if i briefly at this hour reminded your lordships of the purpose of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment presupposes <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is quite true as my noble friend says that here too we do not see it in quite the same way <e> <s> i certainly understand the fears behind this amendment <e> <s> in recent years local authorities themselves have begun to publish more information on their own performance in response to the codes of practice which have been produced under the local government planning and land act <e> <s> publication of this information is an important step in our campaign to increase public awareness of local government activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i apologise for that he is quite right <e> <s> i am sure he will accept from me that we did divide on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to give a more detailed explanation <e> <s> like most other noble lords am trying not to go into depth but if the point is raised i must explain <e> <s> i will set out briefly how clause will operate <e> <s> after the necessary consultations the commission will embark on its studies under this clause <e> <s> they will be designed to enable it to prepare reports on the impact of statutory provisions on ministerial guidance on value for money in the provision of local government service <e> <s> they will have to publish or otherwise make available a report on each study and send the report to the comptroller and auditor-general <e> <s> it will be open to the commission as the clause now stands to identify individual authorities in this report if it so wishes <e> <s> this follows the form adopted in the original amendment which was put down for the report stage in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say to the noble lord lord mottistone that the commission has discretion as to what should be published <e> <s> it does not have to identify individual authorities <e> <s> regarding the league tables it depends on what is published <e> <s> if you publish and decide that an authority is good or bad because it spends more or less and this has so often been the case in the past that in no way should he a measure of whether it is efficient or otherwise <e> <s> when the previous labour government were in power if a list was published that showed a local authority spent little the lowest if you like it was frowned upon as not doing its job <e> <s> today in the same list if the same authority is spending least then it is applauded as doing very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone because that is precisely what i was going to say <e> <s> although clause states that the commission shall do the studies it does not say how many or on what subjects <e> <s> that is for the commission to decide as it has a great deal of discretion and choice <e> <s> i would only repeat to my noble friend that the commission still has its discretion as to what shall be published <e> <s> it does not have to publish <e> <s> we discussed in some detail earlier the principles underlying the new clause and i then sought to explain why i thought that local governments doubts about the clause will not be borne out in practice <e> <s> i would only repeat that members of another place attached great importance to these studies and for that reason too i cannot recommend your lordships to weaken the clause by substituting <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i will certainly answer the noble baroness <e> <s> i was trying to move on but since the noble baroness has asked me will answer that the transitional schedule deals with - and sets out what should follow where a supplementary rate or precept or a rate or precept made for less than a full year made or issued at any time before the bill is enacted in relation to a period beginning on or after st april falls on royal assent <e>", "<cs> my lords we have of course debated this amendment before and it has also been discussed in another place <e> <s> i could hardly fail to be aware that the proposed power of direction to the secretary of state and his power to require information is a matter of concern to a number of your lordships <e> <s> for my part i must repeat that i consider the power to be a proper one and it is also i submit not quite so drastic a provision as is suggested <e> <s> perhaps i might begin with this last point and stress how carefully the power is hedged about with safeguards against improper use <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly some of the dwellings concerned would be suitable for homesteading or for whatever other remedies can be applied to bring them back into use <e> <s> but i would only commend my noble friend lady gardner and indeed as i said previously anyone who is interested in this subject in depth to read through the pamphlet <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first place i would agree with what the noble lord says that the percentage is too high <e> <s> but i would not agree with his point about the amount of money available because today more than at any other time authorities are in receipt of capital receipts amounting to hundreds of millions of pounds which they can spend on anything to do with housing or anything else <e> <s> if that is the priority which they think it should be and which i think the noble lord and certainly i think it should be then they have the resources today in a way that they may not have had at any time previously <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that first the government give some billion a year in subsidies to local authorities for housing <e> <s> secondly as one who at one time had to decide how much money to spend on rehabilitating the stock of council houses i believe that if the money is there there can be very few better investments than putting the housing stock into good shape <e> <s> therefore if the money is there and it is i should have thought that that was a priority <e> <s> there are no limitations on authorities as to <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot assume what authorities were thinking but it has to be said that the total amount spent on capital spending and work of this kind by authorities was an under-spend last year of over million <e> <s> with respect i do not think it is good enough to say that it is all because they fear there may be a rainy day and therefore they are keeping this money <e> <s> if i had the money and was in their position i would feel obliged to spend it upon rehabilitating my housing stock because all else apart that carries with it no further obligations by way of a long-term interest debt <e> <s> i still think that that is a priority and that authorities should use money in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises an important point <e> <s> i would want to look carefully both into the report to which he refers and also into the observations which he makes <e> <s> it is very relevant to the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that if my noble friend puts down the same question for my colleagues who answer for scotland and wales he will receive far better replies than i am able to give today <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be proper to say that my right honourable friend the secretary of state and my honourable friend the minister for housing are trying hard to encourage local authorities to spend money on this type of rehabilitation and so on <e> <s> it must be a great cause of concern to everyone that there are so many dwellings empty in this way <e> <s> therefore yes i am grateful for what the noble lord says and i appreciate that and i can only assure him that i will as will my colleagues do my utmost together with not against local authorities to try to help to solve this really serious problem <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly introduced the priority estates project and so clearly we are committed to continuing to support it <e> <s> i am glad that the noble baroness mentioned it because it is imaginative although as i should like to add only one of the many imaginative subjects we have introduced to deal especially with those categories of people who need to have accommodation such as first-time buyers and for home ownership for homesteading and for bringing into housing this stock which is empty <e> <s> we are doing a whole range of things because the situation is a critical one <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i agree with what the noble baroness says but one of the greatest contributions that can be made in my opinion is to take these older homes and let them go to people who are themselves willing to take them on board to bring them into shape <e> <s> homesteading is very progressive and there is much more that can and ought to be done with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall write to my noble friend with that information because although i have the information here it would take some time to give it <e> <s> i have given it before but i will certainly send a letter with that information <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i will begin by reminding your lordships since i suspect that if do not do so some others may that this is the third transport bill that i have brought before the house in as many years <e> <s> i suppose this will inevitably mean that at least some of your lordships will be tempted to approach this afternoons debate with a sense of having been here before and may well be thinking that examination of transport legislation is fast becoming a regular feature of our proceedings at around this time of year <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would depend on the context in which one was saying this <e> <s> here one is referring to those who are offenders <e> <s> it is a legal nicety <e> <s> the noble lord may well be right though i suspect in this case he may not be <e> <s> if it should prove to be that he is right and i am not then as he knows <e>", "<cs> my lords far from the remarks of the noble lord contributing nothing i think that with <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that the point that the noble lord makes will be considered <e> <s> should it be felt that the drafting requires some adjustment i shall talk with my colleagues <e> <s> so far as i am concerned at the moment clearly i would expect to leave it as it is <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems that the sweetness and light with which i introduced the question that this bill do now pass has gone a few moments ago we had the darkness as well and some noble lords particularly those opposite have contributed towards that too <e> <s> i suppose that i have to respond i certainly want to respond to one or two observations that have been made but i will try to do so very briefly <e> <s> i do not consider this is the occasion on which to cover one or two of the detailed points which have been raised but if there is anything that does require correspondence your lordships know that will undertake to deal with them in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness may believe that it does not improve the bill but if we did not think that it improved the bill we would not have done it <e> <s> quite clearly we believe that it improves the bill <e> <s> if the bill is longer it is because matters needed to be spelled out in more detail <e> <s> one is criticised if one does too much and then again one is criticised if one does not do enough <e> <s> i have been here long enough to know that trying to respond to requests is a no-win situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be glad to make sure that my right honourable friend is made aware of what my noble friend says <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the argument might have been about what is a substantial subsidy <e> <s> the fact is that at the present <e>", "<cs> my lords it has always been the fact that local authorities have the right to make local decisions because they are best placed so to do but it is also always the fact that in making those decisions they have to take into account the interests of all the people whom they represent and not least those who put up the money <e>", "<cs> my lords once again my noble friend makes a very telling point <e> <s> i am sure that this is something which my right honourable friend will want to consider along with the report of the select committee to which i referred in my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords may i simply say that if we return to the original question namely whether the government are contemplating doing something to take this service out of the control of the greater london council the matter has to wait until we have the report to which i have referred in my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time the noble baroness hits the nail on the head <e> <s> the fact is that there is widespread support for the idea of a separate transport authority and for london transport to be moved away from the glc <e> <s> i would say categorically that we as a government are determined that after the chaos and it has to be said the incompetence of the past few months londoners should have a better deal in the way that their transport is organised and run <e>", "<cs> my lords there was no statutory obligation on the kensington and chelsea council to consult my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment about the demolition of this building nor was any such advice sought or given <e>", "<cs> my lords the point really revolves entirely around the word local <e> <s> the fact is that the local authority is the planning authority and the law as it is at the present time means that it is their decision and only their decision <e> <s> if the noble baroness is suggesting that the government might interfere in that she would want to think very carefully because the implications of that are very far-reaching <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought one of your lordships might ask that very question <e> <s> i answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what my noble friend says with much interest <e>", "<cs> my lords as a fellow ratepayer albeit only a temporary part-time resident of kensington and chelsea once again i am very interested in what my noble friend says <e> <s> i am sure that there will be many others who will also be interested <e>", "<cs> my lords i am anxious not to get into the midst of what clearly is a difference of view by different residents of the authority <e> <s> whether or not the demolition should have taken place as it did in the way that it did is really not for me to comment upon <e> <s> i understand the concern that it created and the feelings of those like the noble baroness who raised the question <e> <s> equally one must be cognisant of the fact that there is another view that has been expressed in your lordships house today <e> <s> the government can really only watch what happens and see whether this should ever become a matter that is so extensive that they should think about it but certainly not at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i hardly think that the two situations the one i dealt with earlier and the one i am dealing with now can in any way be considered comparable <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had the letter drawn to my attention but whether or not the local authority concerned did or did not observe the regulations is something upon which i cannot comment <e> <s> clearly if there are those who think that they did not they would take all necessary steps to ensure that appropriate action thereon was taken <e>", "<cs> your lordships will note from the reaction to that question the great popularity that such a move would bring bout <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill and to the noble baroness lady seear and i shall try to answer the points that they have raised <e> <s> first of all the noble lord lord underhill talked about the investment programme <e> <s> i feel that when we talk about the investment programme of british rail we should bear in mind a few of the facts <e> <s> those who travel on the st pancras/ bedford route will see a classic example of million of investment lying idle because the workforce simply will not put it to use <e> <s> we often hear that if investment was made first then there would be a response but here is a classical example of a very substantial investment having been made and we sec the response <e> <s> i think that is a cause for much concern when we are talking about investment <e>", "<cs> my lords on the latter point the noble lord makes a good point <e> <s> i cannot give an immediate answer but i would assure him that the government would expect that we practise what we preach and i will take away and discuss it and make sure that it is happening <e> <s> as to a ballot this is a decision for the union people at the conference <e> <s> i should have thought that it probably was a good thing to do <e> <s> i should welcome it but it is their decision <e> <s> otherwise i would agree with and accept the other points that the noble lord made about the great burden imposed on everyone in the short term <e> <s> some of us are very concerned about the longer term effects that it will have on jobs and those who read sir peter parkers letter and some may feel that it came at the last moment may feel that it is a moving one and i hope that no one thinks that this is playing around for negotiating advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to comment on the extent to which that act is or is not defective and is contributing to the particular situation at the moment <e> <s> i hope that one would always be looking at ways to improve legislation <e> <s> i should not have thought when we are now in the third transport bill of this governments term that there was much need to complain that we are not prepared to make changes <e> <s> if the point that my noble friend makes has some specific aspect he would like to discuss with me <e> <s> i should be glad to hear of it from him <e> <s> i am reminded by my noble friend lord avon that my particular office has started staggering <e> <s> they were there at six oclock this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords i should prefer not to make a comment on that point <e> <s> precisely because of what i have said at the moment i am anxious not to exacerbate the situation by giving a view <e> <s> everyone has his own view <e> <s> i do not think it would help if i commented on this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that there would be much sympathy with that point that the noble baroness makes <e> <s> i ought properly to answer the one specific question that she put <e> <s> it was whether an offer was made and whether it was agreed to and later rejected <e> <s> i shall spell out my words carefully <e> <s> the dispute between london transpot and its unions arose in the first place with the introduction of a new timetable on the london underground <e> <s> the unions were not prepared to accept the new timetables and the underground has been more or less at a complete halt all last week <e> <s> after extensive talks london transport offered a full weeks cooling-off period and aslef representing per cent <e> <s> of the drivers and tssa representing clerical and managerial staff were prepared to accept the offer <e> <s> it is understood that the nurs london transport representatives were also prepared to accept <e> <s> the offer had to go to the nur national executive for a final decision <e> <s> they rejected it out of hand and called an all-out strike of their members from midnight of last night <e> <s> nur members run the signal boxes and the system cannot work without them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill is clearly seeking to make a case for removing nbcs national express network from the ambit of this bill <e> <s> in the governments view that would be to miss a great opportunity <e> <s> national express has had very considerable success since this governments transport act removed all licensing controls on express coach services <e> <s> passenger carryings in were per cent <e> <s> up on the previous year and the financial performance of the business also improved though by a lesser amount <e> <s> i am glad to pay tribute to that success <e> <s> it is surely a happy commentary on the results of the act although as i seem to recall that part of it was strongly opposed by noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> we are in many ways moving away from the basic reasons behind what is proposed in this part of the bill <e> <s> i hear what my noble friend lord teviot says and he knows that whenever he speaks on practical matters not only affecting those who drive and the vehicles involved i want to know his views because of his expert knowledge <e> <s> nevertheless we need to get hack to the basics on this which brings us to the point made by the noble lord lord molloy and it might help if i re-stated the position <e> <s> the amendment ignores the fact that nbc would retain a significant shareholding secondly it ignores the potential for improving profitability which could come with wider access to investment capital thirdly it ignores the proceeds of sale which would flow to nbc as one of their sources of external finance and fourthly it ignores nbcs continued involvement at the operational level in supplying national express with marginal capacity engineering and maintenance services all of which will be paid for at the proper commercial rate <e>", "<cs> it will not be the first time i have failed to convince the noble lord lord mishcon and i suspect it will not be the last <e> <s> i am sorry he feels there is no logical basis for my argument <e> <s> to me it seemed clear enough and still does <e> <s> i omitted to answer a point made by my noble friend lord teviot <e> <s> it is part of the whole matter <e> <s> the point about nbc setting up a new coach company was mentioned <e> <s> there would be no legal restriction on that but surely in effect that would mean that nbc would be cutting off its nose to spite its face <e> <s> the governments intention is that nbc should remain committed to national express through the retention of a significant shareholding <e> <s> well <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to say so i would point that as he rightly said amendment no <e> <s> takes up the whole matter of the percentages of shareholding and i should prefer to deal with the question at that time <e> <s> he asks what is significant <e> <s> it depends on different circumstances and different situations <e> <s> in certain circumstances per cent <e> <s> can be very significant but the noble lord knows as others know that in this instance that is not so <e> <s> i do not want to go into detail at this stage <e> <s> i am sorry if i do not satisfy the noble lord on the point but we shall be talking about it in a moment and i should prefer to discuss it under amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am sorry that i cannot add much more <e> <s> clearly the noble lord lord underhill knows that the government are not in a position to accept the amendment and i fear that i cannot go further than that <e>", "<cs> if an nbc subsidiary is to escape the constraints of the public sector and attract genuine risk capital then the bus company must relinquish effective control <e> <s> this was made clear during our second reading debate <e> <s> the amendment we are considering would prevent nbc disposing of more than per cent <e> <s> of its interest in a subsidiary <e> <s> the bus company would therefore retain effective control and the whole purpose of the governments policy would be defeated <e> <s> none of the advantages of access to private finance would be available to the business <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of states consent is required to the initial disposal of shares and to control subsequent transactions surely would be an unwarranted interference <e> <s> the fact is that the secretary of state will always have control over any further disposals by nbc <e> <s> that is a safeguard <e> <s> i want to be helpful in this matter <e> <s> if i were pressed to say and <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the two situations go hand in hand at all <e> <s> the unhappy scenario that my noble friend paints for us is a situation tied up entirely with many many other facets of this whole area of public transport the local authorities obligations the extent to which there should be subsidy or not how much the ratepayer contributes how much the taxpayer contributes what is the philosophy of public versus private cars and so on <e> <s> it is a problem that he rightly raises but so far as i can see it is not the one that we are discussing in dealing with this amendment <e> <s> on that we come back to the basic philosophy either one agrees that there should be private control of this sector or not <e> <s> the government clearly do and noble lords opposite clearly think otherwise <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to extend the requirement for the secretary of states consent to <e>", "<cs> i must have been nodding my head in the wrong place <e> <s> perhaps it would help if i repeated what i said in order to clarify the point which the noble lord mentions <e> <s> i said that the national bus companys undertakings are subsidiaries and as such are companies act companies <e> <s> i said it is not possible to sell a company without selling the shares in it <e> <s> so it is difficult to see how the national bus company could dispose of an entire undertaking without consent <e> <s> but of course one can always sell assets and one can always sell parts <e> <s> that clearly i know <e>", "<cs> the decision to press this amendment is in the hands of the noble lord who moved the amendment <e> <s> what i will undertake to do is read carefully what has been said <e> <s> i understand it clearly in my own mind and that it is as i have explained it that the fears should not exist <e> <s> however because we are now in a field of the kind we are i will of course take this point away and talk to advisers and colleagues about it <e> <s> should it be that the points are valid then noble lords know what we will do <e> <s> if we do not feel the points are valid then it is always open to your lordships to decide what to do about it at a later stage <e>", "<cs> the government have no doubt that their policy of introducing private capital will be of benefit both to nbc and to the travelling public <e> <s> it has never been our contention that each and every one of nbcs subsidiaries of which there are more than will necessarily be better off there are bound to be some winners and some losers within the overall improvement that the government expect to see <e> <s> we are opposed to this amendment because it could give rise to technical challenges intended to frustrate the policy approved by parliament in this bill <e> <s> perhaps i may remind your lordships that under clause it is in fact the nbc who are being given the power of disposal <e> <s> they will be responsible for putting forward schemes for the introduction of private capital <e> <s> it seems to me in the highest degree unlikely that they will propose a course of action which they believe to be against the interests of the company <e> <s> equally if it came to the point where nbc were proceeding under a direction from the secretary of state the secretary of state would clearly have already reached a judgment about the best interests of the company its subsidiaries and the travelling public <e> <s> so i think the amendment is in large measure unnecessary quite apart from the fact that it has a potential for being destructive <e>", "<cs> i fear that in this case i cannot agree to do that <e> <s> i think what i said although not at great <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon who did give me an intimation that he wished to raise this point and it enables me to try to clarify the position <e> <s> let me first say however that i do not think we need dwell too long on the amendment <e> <s> it simply corrects an earlier slip of the drafting by changing company to bus company <e> <s> the latter is the term used throughout the rest of part i for the national bus company and is defined in clause <e>", "<cs> we have already made it known that we see the power of direction conferred on the secretary of state by clause of the bill as a reserve power <e> <s> it is our object to see agreement between the government and the national bus company over the introduction of private capital <e> <s> all the signs are that this is possible on the basis of progress made so far <e> <s> it may be that we shall have some differences with the company along the way <e> <s> it would be naive of us to expect none <e> <s> however i hope that mutually acceptable solutions will be found <e>", "<cs> if ever i have heard of a mountain being made out of a molehill this really is it <e> <s> i always delight in listening to the noble lord lord davies of leek if only for his rhetoric and he knows this <e> <s> but we are going off at a total tangent <e> <s> who would have thought that here was something new to quote the noble lord being slipped into the bill some sinister attempt to introduce a new amalgam as my noble friend called it something new <e> <s> there is a mass of precedent <e> <s> it is most unfair to imply that here is something that is for the first time before us some sinister new attempt for what was it the noble lord lord davies said <e> <s> all good people come to the defence of democracy <e> <s> i trust he was saying the same thing when the nationalisation measures were being brought in by his administration <e>", "<cs> i am not aware that i am misleading the committee <e> <s> certainly i would not do so intentionally <e> <s> i would not want to do so unintentionally <e> <s> but i am advised in fact that the situation which i describe is the case in the oil and gas bill <e> <s> if it should not be so then of course the noble lord knows that i will see that that assertion is corrected <e> <s> the fact is that it does not alter the basic tenor of what i am saying and which so concerns my noble friend lord balfour <e> <s> here is nothing that is new and that is here for the first time <e> <s> the amalgam to which he refers is not new at all <e> <s> this is normal procedure <e> <s> if we were to divide on this amendment and it were to be carried then it has implications of massive scale <e> <s> i really would ask the noble lord to think carefully <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may make just one observation at this stage <e> <s> when we were discussing amendment no <e> <s> i think i referred to the oil and gas enterprise bill and the procedure therein <e> <s> i think that i ought to correct something that i said at the time <e> <s> i was advised that there was no requirement placed on parliament even by way of the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> in fact i am now informed that there is a requirement in the bill <e> <s> i should not in any way want to mislead the committee and so i thought that i should take the opportunity to apologise for the misstatement and i readily do so <e>", "<cs> i think that i should be able to assure the noble lord lord underhill that his proposed new clause is unnecessary <e> <s> as he says there is no difference between us on the end objective <e> <s> nothing in the bill alters or limits in any way nbcs powers to develop its property in conjunction with other public authorities be they other nationalised industries local authorities or other publicly-owned bus operators such as the ptes <e> <s> such developments are frequently a sensible way of making best use of an nbc site and the government wish to see them continue <e> <s> indeed we have said so explicitly in the first words of part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i do not quarrel at all with the basic tenet of what the noble lord lord tanlaw says <e> <s> i would not have thought that what we are talking about on this amendment in this part of the bill was relevant to his point other than that it would bring us to a state in which the bus company could then do the things that it wants to do with regard to its properties and i say again that nothing in the bill in any way changes or detracts from its present powers <e> <s> it is to bring an additional new scene if you like into the whole area of this kind of possibility <e>", "<cs> this clause in fact serves two purposes <e> <s> it defines related company for the purposes of this clause and for clause and it confirms that the nbc may provide for any related company services which they have power to provide for any of their subsidiaries <e> <s> it would be unreasonable to give nbc an unfettered power to provide management-type services for any company in which they had ever held an interest no matter how small <e> <s> the distinction therefore strikes a <e>", "<cs> one might put it a different way by saying that the proposed amendment would enable the trustees of an nbc pension fund or trade unions representing members of such funds to dictate through the agency of the secretary of state the terms of the pension scheme to be offered to employees of an nbc subsidiary transferred to private ownership <e> <s> he could be required to make a pension order to ensure that employees would enjoy the same pension expectations as if they had remained nbc employees <e>",

he describes still pertains today <e> <s> i shall gladly write to him about that matter <e>", "<cs> in responding to my noble friend lord teviot may i first confirm what i said i suspected <e> <s> most weekly-paid staff are members of the bus employees superannuation trust which has some members is fully funded and provides index-linked benefits <e> <s> but of course i will write to my noble friend with further details in that <e> <s> i was grateful to the noble lord lord byers for what he said <e> <s> he was clearly speaking from much experience <e> <s> he simply called a spade a spade and that is something which one often tries to avoid doing <e> <s> but he spelled it out and that is what the reality of life is all about <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord is considering this aspect it might be helpful if i said that the majority of national bus company employees are members of one of the companys main pension schemes the bus employees superannuation trust or the national bus pension fund <e> <s> employees have been given every encouragement to become members of one of these modern schemes <e> <s> some have chosen to remain in old pension schemes which do not provide the same level of benefits <e> <s> however it has become the national bus companys customary practice to provide some additional benefits under the old schemes by means of <e>", "<cs> i wonder if my noble friend would allow me to clarify the situation <e> <s> am i to understand from the noble lord lord underhill who made such an explicit and detailed speech when opposing the amendment that he too is covering the points made in amendments nos <e> <s> and which i believe is what my noble friend is saying <e>", "<cs> it will be clear from the discussion we have had so far that this clause is the most important one in pal t ii of the bill <e> <s> it provides for the authorisation of a private sector authority and private sector inspectors to carry out testing <e> <s> this provides the framework within which we hope to see an improved service for the road transport industry which will maintain the highest standards of safety and impartiality <e>", "<cs> a qualified yes because i have been at great pains to stress that the flexibility here has to be less than one would normally wish to see in something of this kind <e> <s> flexibility to the extent that it be not the only single company certainly i think we must go beyond that <e> <s> i am anxious here not to stress the flexibility point <e> <s> i am more anxious to stress the safety factor all the time <e> <s> it is the ultimate point in this matter <e> <s> although there may be the kind of ability to manoeuvre that my noble friend indicated nevertheless i would want to stress again that it is the safety factor that is all-important here and that it is parliament that has the say at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to say that i am in full agreement with the noble lord lord underhill on the point he has made <e> <s> the supervision of statutory testing should be carried out only by the department of transports officials the bill was in fact amended in another place to make this absolutely clear <e> <s> perhaps i could refer your lordships to clause which in lines to categorically rules out the supervision of an approved testing authoritys examination by anyone who is not an officer of the secretary of state <e> <s> under this provision private sector inspectors may only supervise examinations carried out by their own employer as part of his own internal management <e>", "<cs> i think i can give the information to the noble lord but it may be necessary to write to him to elaborate on it <e> <s> to his first question the uniformity of charges the answer is yes and cross-subsidisation will continue <e> <s> i gladly confirm that again <e> <s> as the noble lord says the clause defines the limits of private sector testing and lists the functions which may be transferred to the private sector <e> <s> within the limits set by this clause the secretary of state can decide what exactly should be done in the private sector and by whom <e> <s> but if as we intend the testing system is transferred to the lloyds register vehicle testing association then all the functions listed in this clause will be transferred to them <e> <s> as i have a great deal of information here which i think the noble lord would like to have to enable him to look at the matter in more detail rather than go over it now i would suggest writing to him and then he can always question it again later if necessary <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord underhill rightly said many of the points that need to be raised in connection with this matter are very similar to those we were discussing earlier but so far as the civil service is concerned perhaps i could give some information which the noble lord might find helpful in considering his position in the matter <e> <s> as with the other pension matter we all want to see fair and reasonable provision made for the future pensions of testing staff after they leave the civil service <e>", "<cs> it always means what it says <e> <s> whether we understand it and interpret it in the way that we would want is another matter that always applies <e> <s> first there is the question why do we need the power to lend to a government-owned company <e> <s> it was originally proposed that testing should be transferred to a government company for an interim period allowing time to prepare for the testing stations to be sold to the private sector in a number of chains <e> <s> loans would be made to the government company in order to allow it to buy the testing stations from the secretary of state <e> <s> these would be repaid when the company received the proceeds of the sale to private sector companies <e>", "<cs> i think that i can perhaps help with that point <e> <s> i said that the powers in clause are restricted to the secretary of states own interim company only if and i stressed this such a company were set up <e> <s> that should perhaps assuage the noble lords concern on that point but i said a few moments ago did i not <e> <s> that we could perhaps consider the other point that he raises <e> <s> we ought to be sure that we have it absolutely right and i certainly undertake to consider it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps we may consider that indeed i undertake to do so <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i can expand further than i did previously on this point <e> <s> as i said before it was originally proposed that the testing should be transferred to a government company for an interim period allowing time and so on and clearly it is felt that this is desirable on this point <e> <s> i confess that i cannot go into more detail now but it has certainly been considered that this is now necessary <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes i will certainly go further into the matter with him too if necessary and perhaps that may be the right way for us to proceed at this time <e>", "<cs> i thought i had been able to give reassurance to my noble friend and others <e> <s> we have agreed in principle <e> <s> we are down the road much further than my noble friend intimates and now we are dealing with the nuts and bolts the details <e> <s> i cannot say tomorrow or next monday <e> <s> i do not know <e> <s> i will try to firm it up as best i can and be in touch with all who are interested in this point to give them the most information i have on that matter <e> <s> but there is no cause that i know to consider other than that this agreement is going forward <e>", "<cs> i would say that it did include the persons in the categories the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> that would be my answer <e> <s> if it should prove otherwise i would be in touch with the noble lord <e> <s> my interpretation now is yes it would include them <e>", "<cs> my lords of course on the latter point it is disappointing and some might say it is more than disappointing <e> <s> it has all sorts of implications <e> <s> so far as the statistics are concerned million have been invested since <e> <s> since that figure is billion <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has put to me about ten supplementary questions in one <e> <s> i am at pains always in answering questions to be as factual as i can and not to exacerbate situations which are very sensitive <e> <s> nevertheless i think that in the interest of giving a few facts to answer the points that the noble lord raises i should say that the boards figures show that productivity between and rose by per cent <e> <s> and between and fell by i per cent <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether the secretary of state should not if you like step in <e> <s> i think the answer to that must be that the government have no intention of intervening in what is a matter for the railways board to settle with its workforce <e> <s> i think the noble lord was less than his usual evenhanded self when he suggested that it is in any way the responsibility of british rail for not being willing to talk about this matter when having made their offer to do precisely that it was aslef who called a strike <e> <s> in those circumstances there can be no meaningful discussions and negotiations so that it is not too helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords that certainly has not been helpful at all i agree with my noble friend on that <e> <s> it is not surprising that the leader of the national union of railwaymen has expressed his own dismay at that intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be helpful to say that the aslef membership feared the very point that the noble lord makes but i would have to go on to say that the report of the railway staff national tribunal proposed a series of safeguards to protect the interests of the drivers and to allay their fears and that the board accepted these safeguards in full <e> <s> it is worth pointing out that over per cent <e> <s> of british rail guards are now working flexible rostering and that with only one exception all other european railways are successfully and fully operating flexible rostering <e>", "<cs> my lords i am able to give an indication of that <e> <s> it is that the benefits which would flow from the introduction of flexible rostering and associated items total over million <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware what the noble baroness has said is correct <e> <s> i think the public are not being starved of comment and information about what is happening <e> <s> i am sure they will come to their own conclusions and they would probably be the ones the noble baroness mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will know that i can make no such comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what my noble friend has said as to that <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure i gave is over million <e> <s> the figure i have is million <e> <s> as to what it refers yes it is to cover flexible rostering and associated items <e> <s> if the noble lord would like a breakdown i will send it to him <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i would like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill and to the noble lord lord rochester for what they have said and for the restrained way in which they have made their comments <e> <s> i hope that i shall deal with the matter similarly <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill asked whether it was recognised that men do not lightly take action of this kind unless there is due cause <e> <s> this clearly would not be the moment for me to go over the background as to how one comes to this position at present after so long a period of negotiations <e> <s> however i think that the noble lord would also accept from me that the board too are responsible people who recognise their obligations to the country as a whole and therefore i trust that that is equally important in this whole unhappy situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i would simply like to say that i confirm the figures that the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe has mentioned <e> <s> they are figures which i too have and i can only in the main agree with what the noble lord says <e> <s> i think that he too recognises the grave concern that there is on all sides <e> <s> we want to see a solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i could venture an opinion but frankly if the noble marquess will excuse me i would prefer not to do so at this moment precisely because i think that if i am right it might not help the situation generally <e> <s> i would prefer not to answer the point <e> <s> clearly this is one of the legal points which <e>", "<cs> i entirely accept that it is a very important point and that is why i am absolutely certain that the board have it well in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the very last thing i shall do is make my own observations on what i think of the way in which the mass media is presenting this or any other points if it comes to that <e> <s> i would probably have to disagree with the point that the noble lord made <e> <s> i do not think that there is an unfair representation of that point of view and i would have to say that <e> <s> beyond that there is no way in which i shall enter into the debate <e>", "<cs> may i emphasise the overall aim of our proposals in clause and schedule <e> <s> what precisely is it that we are trying to do <e> <s> it is to strengthen the powers of the licensing authorities and to enable them to take adequate account of environmental considerations in dealing with road haulage operators licences <e> <s> at present the licensing system does not allow this but we all know of the concern caused by the activities of operators with unsuitable facilities <e>", "<cs> my noble friends second amendment in this little group reflects as he has said the concern expressed by the road haulage industry that the conditions which a licensing authority could attach to a licence might prejudice established businesses and circumvent the protection otherwise afforded by our proposals to existing operators <e> <s> let me say straightaway that i am not in the slightest unsympathetic to the use of lorries quite the contrary <e> <s> i think anyone who does not today recognise that they have an absolutely essential part to play in so many aspects of our everyday life commercial even private really is living in another world entirely <e> <s> i do not think as far as i am concerned that is so and i gladly assure my noble friend as to that <e> <s> i suspect that members of the committee would go along with me on that <e> <s> i think what is of concern here is the question of balance trying to ensure that while one does cover the points of concern of my noble friend we also look at certain other aspects at this time of change the new situation that we take them all into account <e> <s> that is all we are trying to do <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may comment on one or two of the observations that have been made <e> <s> let me deal first with the right of appeal point <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill is absolutely right there is the right of appeal to the transport tribunal <e> <s> i think i should say to my noble friend lord caithness that in fact the local authorities have nothing to do with this at all beyond the fact that they can make objections if they wish to the licensing authority <e> <s> however they are not the arbiters they are not the ones who are making the decisions it is the licensing authority who will do that <e> <s> licensing is a quasi-judicial appointment rather like that of a magistrate <e> <s> that is really <e>", "<cs> so far as we are concerned yes <e> <s> if we had agreed the groupings i thought that would be the way to do it <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend give way <e> <s> do i understand from my noble friend that he having seen this suggested list of groupings did not agree with it <e> <s> if so did he say so <e>", "<cs> i would just want to say that as the noble lord lord mishcon so properly put it there are procedures that one follows in this <e> <s> having gone through myself i think some amendments in the last three years i am not entirely unfamiliar with what has to be done <e> <s> we always try hard to observe the courtesies and i challenge my noble friend lord mottistone or anyone else to say otherwise <e> <s> occasionally one can make a mistake <e> <s> i frankly do not think a mistake was made on this occasion <e>", "<cs> the draft clause suffers drafting defects <e> <s> there seems to be a strange confusion between primary legislation and secondary legislation <e> <s> secondary legislation of this kind is made under enabling powers <e> <s> the clause is dressed in the guise of a mandatory requirement <e> <s> this is more apparent than real as the most limited provision which was at once revoked would seem to satisfy it <e> <s> nevertheless the requirement would be incompatible with its context <e> <s> for example the mandatory requirement could not be grafted on the discretionary powers in section and incompatible with the purpose of secondary legislation of this kind which requires genuine consultation and adaptation to new developments <e>", "<cs> let me explain the governments view on this matter if i may <e> <s> this clause attempts to compel the minister to introduce regulations outlawing toughened glass windscreens and making only laminated ones lawful <e> <s> i am sure the intention is to be helpful in so far as it is based on the commonly held but nevertheless mistaken view that laminated glass is always superior on safety grounds to toughened glass <e> <s> the evidence on the contrary is inconclusive <e> <s> at present there is insufficient data to show beyond reasonable doubt that in british operating conditions laminated glass is superior <e> <s> i should say straightaway that investigations on this matter are being made by the transport road research laboratory and by the departments engineers <e> <s> the first investigations are almost completed and the latter ones are well under way <e> <s> a report will be made in september of this year <e> <s> if i may take up the point made by the noble lord lord airedale i can reassure him that there are powers already under section of the act so that if action needs to be taken action can be taken <e> <s> i think that was really his concern <e>", "<cs> i am sure that there will be no problem about publishing the report <e> <s> it is a matter of such general interest that it is surely only right that it should be published <e> <s> as to why we are not as yet taking a line i hoped that the reasons i gave would explain that <e> <s> here is something which in our view is not clear-cut <e> <s> i am sure that those who argued the case for either side do so with absolute conviction and sincerity <e> <s> but we feel not least in the light of other peoples experiences that the case has yet to be made firmly one way or the other <e> <s> but the report should not be long now <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether i can clarify the matter to the extent that the noble lord requests <e> <s> i think the answer to the first point he made is yes that is so <e> <s> at least that is the interpretation i would give <e> <s> on his second point i would think the answer is no because it really has nothing to do with civil liability <e> <s> that is the interpretation i would give but if it should prove to be otherwise then of course i will tell the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for moving this amendment which as he says seeks to improve the conspicuity of builders skips left on the highway at night <e> <s> we think there is much merit in this amendment <e> <s> as drafted the clause is in fact deficient in one or two respects but without going into detail as to what and why may i say that we shall be glad to draw up a revised provision to cater for the object which really both we and the noble lord seek to achieve <e> <s> therefore if he would agree to withdraw his new clause i will undertake to table a suitable amendment for consideration by the house at report <e>", "<cs> we shall certainly take note of what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> may i take up some of the points made as to the extensions that would be required to the list of exemption <e> <s> of course it was inevitable that there would be groups which would be brought to our attention as perhaps worthy of inclusion in the list <e> <s> i said that drawing up the list is a judgment and one always has to bear in mind the possibility that further categories may be included <e> <s> i should be going beyond my remit if i were to say that the chances of further inclusions are fairly remote but having said that i also hasten to say that i will certainly want to discuss the examples given today <e>", "<cs> but even as passengers if compulsion does not apply to them then the choice of wearing the seatbelt or not would be theirs <e> <s> therefore they do not need to have exemption in the form of a medical certificate <e> <s> so they certainly do not have this problem <e>", "<cs> indeed but then if they choose to wear the seat belt which i agree with the noble baroness would be a wise thing to do we are faced with the problem of who will be exempt from a medical charge for a certificate to make them exempt <e> <s> therefore the problem does not apply to them so far as i can see <e> <s> as regards the other point which she made she asked whether the list was a once-and-for-all exemption <e> <s> i would always hope that there is no such thing as once-and-for-ails in matters of this kind <e> <s> that must be right <e> <s> i have said that it will not be easy to have the list extended for the obvious reasons but to say that it should be once-and-for-all is much further than i would want to go <e> <s> however i will consult on that and write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords last observation i presume he was equally surprised last year when similar remarks were made and yet so many local authorities did manage <e> <s> to deal first of all with the comments i thank the noble baroness lady birk and the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley for their first observations <e> <s> i certainly agree with the noble baroness that simple it is not without any doubt but then how could we ever have a simple system when we seek to distribute some billion or billion of money and are talking of around billion of spending among more than authorities on the basis of assessment of need and so on <e> <s> simple it never has been and simple it is not at the present time <e> <s> whether it ever will be who can say <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has touched on two quite separate points <e> <s> the statement refers to the amount of money that will be given <e> <s> although the noble baroness touched on it in a way when she said that this would affect the ability of local government to do its own thing which i understand and from where she sits it was a fair point for her to make although i do not agree with her the necessity to spend more on the infrastructure such as sewers and so on is a point in itself <e> <s> in no way can we equate that with local democracy and its freedoms <e> <s> if we are talking as we are today of providing a cash increase in round figures of some per cent <e> <s> overall in relation to what is being currently spent i do not think that that is being over-hard in any way <e> <s> this is certainly a tough budget but i think it is a fair one <e> <s> when local authorities have looked carefully at what it all means they may feel that it might be less tough than they might have expected in view of the current overspend of billion that we currently have <e>", "<cs> my lords on this point of consultation your lordships are being less than fair or it may be that they do not know just what consultation has been taking place <e> <s> i would say that without any question there has been and there is today more consultation on matters of this kind than there has ever been <e> <s> that is quite a statement to make because i do not know exactly what took place in the past <e> <s> however my own experience of the kind of consultation which went on and of what goes on at present leads me to believe although i am open to correction that local <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the concern of my noble friend and i share it with her <e> <s> that is why i advise a careful re-reading and study of the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords it would depend upon the kind of capital spending that was involved <e> <s> there are certain categories of capital spending which do not have the same revenue implications as others <e> <s> as the noble lord lord northfield knows very well if one spends money on the rehabilitation of houses and so on something which everybody ought to be doing if they are not already doing so clearly there are not the same revenue implications as there are if one builds a sports hall which may involve all kinds of on-going debt charges and also servicing <e> <s> the noble lord knows that in the capital field especially where capital receipts are concerned the government hope that local authorities will use them to help the construction industry <e> <s> it gives employment and we are very much in favour of that <e> <s> however i must be frank and say that the noble lord lord northfield has a point there can be capital spending in addition to that which i have just mentioned which is very desirable but which will have revenue consequences which in the longer term can be a burden <e> <s> there is no other answer except to say that an authority has to look at its own situation and take into account what it can afford to do <e> <s> that is the only advice i can give on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment highlights a difference of philosophy between the government and the noble lords opposite <e> <s> for a very long time the labour party has regarded integration as the be-all and end-all of public transport policy and their approach is embodied in this amendment <e> <s> its iniention i take it is that if a change produces more integration it should go ahead but that if it produces less it should not <e> <s> we on this side of the house see things rather differently <e> <s> of course we are in favour of integration where it leads to better services for the travelling public <e> <s> we accept that integration is a very important concept at the local level <e> <s> my noble friend lord ridley has pointed out that the county councils have a vital role in securing a co-ordinated and efficient service <e> <s> but although we believe in integration we also believe in freedom of choice and choice means competition which in some ways i suppose is the antithesis of integration <e> <s> nowhere has the need for competition been more successfully demonstrated than in the express coach market <e> <s> i have made it clear on a number of occasions that this is one of the principal areas of the national bus companys activities where we wish to see private capital introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will respond to the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> quite clearly he does not see this as a difference of philosophy and i do <e> <s> we shall probably have to disagree on that point <e> <s> the thrust of our objection to this amendment is that if it were approved it would mean that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak yet again and for the last time may i say that no i do not think it is <e> <s> it may be that that is what the noble lord lord underhill intends but i am concerned with what the amendment would mean in practice <e> <s> when i said that it could lead to challenges in the courts i am sure that it could and would if some people wanted to make it so <e> <s> this is a very real difficulty as i see it <e>", "<cs> my lords there certainly is no difference of philosophy between my noble friend and myself and for that matter between the noble lord lord underhill and myself on this particular subject <e> <s> i entirely understand the concern that has been expressed about the possible implication of certain disposals for county councils although i think that they are unfounded <e> <s> perhaps i should make it clear that the government are certainly not against consultation with the county councils in all relevant cases <e> <s> indeed they believe that such consultation will from time to time although perhaps not always be absolutely essential <e> <s> our doubt about the amendment is not that it is misdirected but only that it would add an unnecessary extra layer of statutory consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we have thought carefully about the amendment in the time available <e> <s> perhaps it would help if i very briefly repeat what the bill is about <e> <s> it does not confer requisitioning powers it simply extends the circumstances in which the bus company may dispose of what is legally theirs in the course of normal commercial transactions <e> <s> there is no question of the bus company being able to use their powers under subsection to dispose of the property of county councils nor could the secretary of state direct them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we return with this amendment to the important question of parliamentary accountability <e> <s> the amendment would provide that where the bus company disagreed with a proposed direction it should not take effect until approved by a resolution of each house of parliament <e> <s> before turning to the basic question of the respective roles of the legislature and the executive may i say that i find it rather odd that the bus company should be the ones to decide whether or not a proposed direction does <e>", "<cs> my lords clause provides as has been made clear at earlier stages a reserve power of direction <e> <s> subsection which would be deleted by the amendment provides that the bus company should be under a legal duty to give effect to any direction which the secretary of state might find it necessary to give under this power <e> <s> thus the amendment would remove from the clause the means by which ministerial directions are made statutorily binding on the recipient <e> <s> we would be left with the legal nonsense that the secretary of state could give directions to the bus company but it would be <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment seeks to do two things one of which i believe is unwise and the other of which may well be impossible <e> <s> first it seeks to involve the secretary of state in deciding whether the pension arrangements devised for employees of <e>", "<cs> my lords there is certainly no difference in intention no difference in our wanting to be at the same place at the end of the day in this whole matter <e> <s> as those noble lords know who took part in the committee stage of this bill the government share the aim behind this amendment <e> <s> we have every intention of doing what the noble lords opposite and my noble friend are seeking through this amendment to require us to do that is to authorise as the approved testing authority one respected and impartial organisation which will carry out testing to the highest standards <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to explain <e> <s> if i have not made this clear perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point that the noble lord is seeking to make regarding amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have already considered the arguments for and against restricting the secretary of state to the authorisation of one single body <e> <s> i do not believe that this amendment would achieve what the noble lord intends <e> <s> i am advised that to alter the reference from any person to a person or company or group of companies would not have the effect of preventing the secretary of state from authorising more than one such person or company <e> <s> it might make the provisions of clause less clear <e> <s> it would not rule out what i believe the noble lord wishes to see ruled out <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will agree with me if he follows the point that i am trying to make <e>", "<cs> my lords on the latter point just to dispose of it straight away clearly the expectation is that lloyds register will be concerned with this although as i said earlier the arrangement with them is not yet concluded <e> <s> we fully expect that it will be but i readily concede that until it is concluded it is not a fact <e> <s> but i also went on to say that if it should turn out not to be so an alternative in the same basic form that is one organisation would still apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether by leave of the house i might make a brief comment on what the noble lord lord mishcon has just said <e> <s> of course i entirely agree with him as to the desirability indeed the essentiality of there being a no-conflict situation <e> <s> that is as fundamental to the government in their thinking in this matter as it is to the principle which he enunciated <e> <s> but surely the very fact and this must be the answer to that point that at the end of the day it is parliament and we cannot belittle the importance of that which will have a say as to whether or not the organisation brought forward for approval has the kind of impartiality that it would require to see is the greatest test of all and that is there <e> <s> that is the answer to the point which the noble lord made <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i would have said that in-house supervision really means the normal kind of management supervision one would expect <e> <s> to what extent there is an element of outside supervision of the inside supervision is something on which i shall certainly write not as lengthy a letter as those which i have been writing to the noble lord but one long enough to explain the point which concerns him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon not for the first time for his suggestion and i gladly undertake to write as he suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe this is the point at which it was agreed we should adjourn the proceedings until october <e> <s> i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords as i expected we have had a very lively and interesting debate <e> <s> although i shall try to respond to most of the points which have been made i am sure that your lordships will perhaps excuse me if i do not cover each and every single one <e> <s> however i assure your lordships that i shall carefully read <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord says but i do not see that it in any way affects anything that i have said <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that what the noble lord is asking is what would be the effect of the order on a house <e> <s> if i may i will give an example which could help <e> <s> a wholly well maintained payment on a house with a rateable value of for example would be at present whereas the new payment would be which is quite substantial <e> <s> for a partially well maintained house the existing payment would be and the new payment would be <e> <s> they are quite substantial increases and so they should be after all this time <e>", "<cs> my lords it would <e> <s> but of course as the noble lord knows there has been no revaluation since <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> we have spent many hours discussing many amendments over i believe to a bill which covers a number of very different subjects in the transport field <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity to thank first and foremost my noble friend lord avon who has played such a large and effective part in taking the bill through the house <e> <s> i am deeply grateful to him <e> <s> i thank also my noble and learned friend the lord advocate and my noble friend lord elton for the valuable parts they have played it is a great comfort to have colleagues of such calibre <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for quite properly raising again certain aspects of what is proposed <e> <s> i am glad to try to give some clarification to him <e> <s> it is true as he said that various criticisms have been made on the scope of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to give effect to the convention concerning international carriage by rail signed on th may and to make further provision for the amendment of acts giving effect to other international transport conventions so as to take account of revisions of the conventions to which they give effect <e> <s> beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend has been discussing with the chairman of the housing corporation whether the corporation could use additional resources this year <e> <s> this might enable the corporation to increase expenditure for the remainder of the year on fair rent hostel and low-cost home ownership schemes including those for shared ownership <e> <s> my right honourable friend will be announcing the results of his discussions very shortly <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am glad to say that that is so <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord nugent for reminding the house of the very high quality of those schemes <e> <s> they are available for shared ownership and i am sure that if any of your lordships have not seen them they would find it interesting to note what can be done with imaginative design in housing of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if the noble lord lord leatherland would allow me to cover this point when i respond to the debate as a whole <e> <s> i believe there are a number of other points which your lordships may wish to put and i would like to come to them together if the noble lord will permit <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by thanking those who have participated in responding to the second reading debate <e> <s> i am gratified that just about everyone has given a welcome to the bill although perhaps some more so than others <e> <s> i suppose that the two cheers of the noble lord lord avebury are a plus on what i normally get from the noble lord <e> <s> they are perhaps one more than usual <e> <s> i am sorry that he is not in his place but i am sure that when he reads <e>", "<cs> any measure which sets out to achieve a balance between parties where there may be a difference of view is bound to mean that someone somewhere along the road will feel less happy than another <e> <s> i suppose that that really covers some of the points which the noble lord lord avebury mentioned <e> <s> but i am sure that he will not hesitate to bring them forward at the later stages of the bill and of course it is right that he should do so because what we are interested in as always is to get the very best bill that we can <e> <s> this matter was looked at in <e> <s> nothing really has been done since but hopefully we shall go a long way down the road this time <e>", "<cs> on the last point that the noble lord lord avebury made i should have thought that if a person going on to a site has an opportunity which i would expect him to exercise to see which part of the site he wishes to occupy and considers that the area offered to him is not acceptable it is presumably up to him to say i dont want to be there <e> <s> in that way he should know of all the restrictions and limitations on that part of the site <e> <s> but i will certainly take note of what the noble lord said and if there is uncertainty which could disadvantage the occupier as he would become then we shall want to look into that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has raised an interesting point <e> <s> i am not sure which would be the best way to deal with it or to what extent it is possible for somebody coming onto a site to ascertain beforehand exactly what would be the effect of his being on a specific part of the site <e> <s> whether or not for example the act is sufficiently clear on that point i do not know <e> <s> i should certainly want to look into it <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will appreciate that i cannot accept the amendment but as with everything else we shall speak about during the rest of the committee stage we shall want to look carefully at everything that is said <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal put her points in very simple terms and may i begin by assuring the noble baroness that she is not very likely to say anything which will upset this noble lord <e> <s> would that i could be so certain that i shall not say anything which will upset the noble baroness <e> <s> the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the prescribed notice which site owners will be required to give occupiers when they offer them an agreement will be as the noble baroness has said in simple terms <e> <s> i do not believe that it is necessary to impose this requirement and let me say why <e> <s> it will not be for the site owners to decide the wording of the notice that is the first point <e> <s> site owners will not be the ones to decide the wording <e> <s> the secretary of state will have the power to prescribe the wording by regulations and he will be using that power <e>", "<cs> there is no difference at all between us in what we are seeking to do <e> <s> it is only a question on whether or not there is a necessity to have written into the bill the wording suggested in the amendment <e> <s> i would only repeat that i am absolutely satisfied that there will not be a problem for the very specific reason that it will be an independent secretary of state with no axe to grind who will prescribe the wording <e> <s> whether that is in simple terms or not will be for everyone to judge at the time but it is intended that it should be in very simple terms <e> <s> i just do not think it is necessary to write it into the bill <e>", "<cs> let me say at once that i very much appreciate what my noble friend lady trumpington has said <e> <s> of course it is a fact that throughout the rest of our deliberations on all stages of the bill we shall continue with the same philosophy in trying to get a bill which is a big advance on what was in the act but which again has to hold a balance for the reasons that i have stated and which i shall not repeat now <e>", "<cs> by all means let us test the feeling of the committee on the matter but to put the record right i think i should say that it is not the case that the amendment would remove the need to go to court <e> <s> it would only do so if the site owner obeyed the obligation it imposes <e> <s> today we are talking about site owners who do not obey the obligation in the bill to offer an agreement in the bill <e> <s> if he does not obey one obligation why should he obey another <e> <s> there will always be circumstances in which people have to go to court to enforce their rights <e> <s> however the decision lies with your lordships <e>", "<cs> i do not want to make a great deal of this point but i think that the period suggested in the amendment is too long and i cannot accept it as it is <e> <s> but in fairness i would say that it is an arguable point that the noble lord makes and it brings us back to the question of degree and balance <e> <s> the site owner must be entitled to some degree of certainty and i feel that the amendment would remove that from him in regard to a major group of occupiers and would make it very difficult for him to plan the running of the site effectively <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is much that i can add to what i have said previously <e> <s> one is not saying that out of is right <e> <s> it is not at all that kind <e>", "<cs> i am sure it is not necessary to remind the noble baroness that it was i who during second reading referred to the point of harassment <e> <s> indeed <e> <s> i mentioned if i remember the <e>", "<cs> i do not like to disagree with the noble lord because we so often seem to see eye to eye on matters that we discuss <e> <s> but i shall have to say and i said this on second reading that we do not want to bring in a rent act type bill <e> <s> what the noble lord said about the rent acts is right <e> <s> there is confidence in the rent officers based upon in general the fairness which they have shown and their skill <e> <s> i paid tribute to that a moment ago and i do so again <e> <s> but the fact is that for all the good things that they do and they do many they also have a connotation of bad things in housing certainly since the act <e> <s> that introduced a new range of security of tenure and when i was on the francis committee we always said that would have the effect of drying up the availability of great numbers of dwellings or parts of dwellings that are needed for renting <e>", "<cs> may i say again just to set the record straight that i really do not need any pushing or any lessons on the need for the bill <e> <s> may i remind the <e>", "<cs> then that absolutely explains it <e> <s> had she been i have no doubt that she would have made the point she has made today and so i will not press that point further <e> <s> even so the principle remains fair <e> <s> this government are bringing in this bill trying to do precisely what she wants us to do to protect the interests of people who choose to live in this particular way <e> <s> many of them are very nice homes indeed why not <e> <s> and that is why we are bringing forward the bill <e> <s> they are entitled to protection but in the bringing forward of the bill we are anxious to look after the interests of others too who have an interest in providing the facilities and the sites where this accommodation is placed <e> <s> so we seem to be repeating the same thing again <e> <s> i cannot go as far as the noble baroness would wish me to go <e> <s> i really feel that it would be a mistake to bring a rent act rgime into this bill <e> <s> i think it really would be contrary to what we are trying to do despite the good intentions that i know are behind this amendment on the other side <e> <s> so i cannot help on this occasion <e>", "<cs> in response to the opening observations of the noble lord lord bishopston that there may be those who are disappointed having read some of our proceedings last thursday may i say first that i am sure they will be offset by those who will be very relieved having read those proceedings <e> <s> as comes out again and again in our discussions there are two sides and two groups of people whom we are seeking to protect <e> <s> i only wish if the noble lord felt so badly about what he calls the evasions not covered by the act that someone at that time would have tried to anticipate the things to which our attention is being drawn today <e> <s> of course we do not want loopholes but one needs to know the definition of a loophole <e> <s> one persons loophole is apparently something that is very desirable to others <e> <s> that is what we are trying to protect in seeking to get the best bill that we can <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to finish what i want to say and we can then debate this in the normal way <e> <s> the noble lord says that there is a shortage of pitch sites <e> <s> that is not my information <e> <s> in any case this is a matter of supply and demand <e> <s> the noble lord lord bishopston so often refers to the rent acts <e> <s> i in turn so often refer to the shortcomings of the rent acts and what they have done to reduce the availability of accommodation <e> <s> the same must surely apply in principle here <e> <s> that is why on second reading i said that what we do not want is a rent act type bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a last observation <e> <s> i am not sure what the noble baroness means when she says that the site owner may charge on top of what he deserves <e> <s> i do not know what the noble baroness meant by what he deserves <e> <s> i should <e>", "<cs> not at all <e> <s> the noble lord has not read the bill at all because if he had done so he would have seen that what is proposed is that for the very first time those coming onto a site will have the right to receive a written offer of an agreement something which they have not had previously <e> <s> the mobile home owner has the right to have the notice in a form that the secretary of state will prescribe <e> <s> it will not be just any type of odd notice <e> <s> if he does not get it he has redress <e> <s> so what we are proposing in the bill is a whole advance on what was in the act <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord avebury who was deeply involved in that act and even i think in earlier legislation of this kind will be the first to confirm that what i am saying is correct <e> <s> we are here trying to protect the interests of occupiers of mobile homes who in the past have not had this type of protection <e> <s> we are going a long way down that road and because we are going so far down that road quite naturally there are representations made to us by those on the other side of the fence who feel that we are going too far <e>", "<cs> as i said previously if we try to impose restrictions on the right to charge what is called a premium for the kind of services that i mentioned previously namely cost of transportation cost of connection and so on then we shall be imposing restrictions upon them regarding something which we think it perfectly proper for them to do because they are able to tell the prospective occupier of the home what it will mean to him if he wants to come to their site <e>", "<cs> the bill says that it will be obligatory to offer an agreement <e> <s> the terms of that agreement will be those which we will prescribe <e> <s> we said earlier when discussing this matter that we were having consultation now upon the level of what the discount should be <e> <s> we have had long consultations with all sides on this bill and we have listened carefully to representations <e> <s> we have brought the bill to its present stage by taking notice of what all the interested parties have wanted to do <e> <s> as the noble lord will appreciate we continue to receive representations <e> <s> we continue to get them until the end of the proceedings <e> <s> however the secretary of state prescribes what the notice should say and what has to be involved in an agreement and whether anything else goes on outside certainly has nothing to do with the bill <e>", "<cs> to listen to the noble lord lord bishopston one would think we were introducing some wicked legislation seeking to impose a great new regime on all mobile home occupiers in order to grind them into the dust <e>", "<cs> need i remind the noble lord yet again that the government are introducing the bill and that he is trying to find what he calls loopholes to ensure i presume that the interests of one side are not disadvantaged <e> <s> that is fine and is what a committee stage is supposed to be about but that is not the only thing we are doing <e> <s> need i say yet again that we are trying to get a balanced situation so that all the parties concerned have all their interests properly protected <e> <s> if we cannot get to that optimum situation we are concerned to get as near to it as possible <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might answer now that one point as to what happens if the parties cannot agree on who the arbitrator should be <e> <s> as i understand it at that point the court will have to adjudicate and that is where the matter ends <e> <s> the amendment says the person should be appointed by the president of the rics whereas the bill aims at leaving it to the parties themselves <e> <s> only if they cannot decide who the arbitrator should be will the court decide <e> <s> i suspect that in almost all cases they will be able to decide <e> <s> in the odd cases it might not be possible to decide but that is the way with most legislation in any case <e> <s> but to seek to say who should make the appointment is not i think at all related to what we are trying to do <e>", "<cs> if as the bill states it is for both the parties themselves to agree who the arbitrator should be then no one is appointing anyone at all <e> <s> it is the two parties who themselves have to agree who is to be the <e>", "<cs> i really do not want to go on about this question because otherwise we shall be here for several days but if what we are talking about is an arbitrator mutually agreed by both parties i just cannot see how there can be any problem regarding someone reading the small print <e> <s> if that is not independent what is independent <e> <s> i should have thought that an arbitrator appointed in that way would be far more likely to be regarded as an independent and acceptable <e>", "<cs> i do not see how one can agree to an arbitrator if one does not know who he is <e> <s> one would not agree unless one knew who he was <e> <s> i really do not follow the point <e>", "<cs> what can be more agreeable than the right of both parties to agree among themselves to appoint an arbitrator <e> <s> i can think of nothing that would be more satisfactory <e> <s> i am really astonished to find that we are now into another half hour on the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can clarify this <e> <s> this amendment is designed to amend the way in which the bill deals with the contents of statutory agreements by adding a system of model terms <e> <s> the bill currently provides in part i of schedule a list of requirements with which agreements must comply in precise terms <e> <s> part ii of schedule lists those subjects which an agreement must cover <e> <s> it does not say how they are to be covered because that is a matter which site owner and occupiers will work out between them in the light of local circumstances <e> <s> if an occupier does not like the way in which these subjects are dealt with in the agreement that is offered to him he can ask a court or an arbitrator to change them <e>", "<cs> i think that is slightly on a different tack <e> <s> clearly i cannot accept this amendment but i want to read what the noble lord has said that i <e>", "<cs> this amendment and amendment no <e> <s> which is consequential upon it would have a considerable effect on the operation of agreements entered into under the bill <e> <s> the bill at present provides for agreements to last indefinitely but for site owners to be able to apply to the court every five years to terminate an agreement on the grounds that having regard to the age and condition of the mobile home it is having a detrimental effect on the amenity of the site or is likely to have such an effect within the next five years <e> <s> this amendment would remove the restriction on the timing of applications to the court <e> <s> it would mean that a site owner could apply to a court every year or more often if he so chose for termination on these grounds <e> <s> it would mean that occupiers would never be secure in their homes <e>", "<cs> we go from one side to the other and the noble lord will probably not be too surprised to know that i cannot agree with his amendment either <e> <s> the bill provides that every five years a site owner may apply to the court to terminate an agreement on the grounds that having regard to its age and condition the mobile home is having a detrimental effect on the amenity of the site or is likely to do so within the next five years <e> <s> the effect of these amendments would be to make termination on these grounds much more strict by entitling courts to terminate only if the mobile home is actually unfit for human habitation <e> <s> i think that that goes too far <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that the reasoning behind my noble friends amendments is that it would be difficult for a court or an arbitrator to judge the life of a mobile home over a five-year period <e> <s> the hypothesis is that a mobile home might in fact be capable of lasting only a further two or three years <e> <s> in such a situation the court would either have to make a decision that was harsh on the occupier by terminating his agreement immediately or one that was harsh to the site owner by forcing him to keep a home on the site beyond the end of its life <e> <s> but the court or the arbitrator will have the benefit of expert advice in considering the life of the mobile home <e> <s> it does not seem unreasonable to me to expect them to be able to look five years ahead <e> <s> in a case where the view of the court was that the mobile home would last only two more years and therefore that the agreement should be terminated there would be nothing to prevent a site owner from allowing an occupier to remain on site on the same basis as that of a statutory agreement <e>", "<cs> the first point i should like to make about the amendment is that i do not believe it would achieve what the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> it would remove the right of first refusal for the site owner but it would not stop him from charging commission <e> <s> with this amendment the bill would be silent about commission <e> <s> the site owner would be able to make the payment of commission a condition of approving the assignment of an agreement so long as he did not fix the commission at so high a level as to amount to an unreasonable withholding of consent <e> <s> what the noble lord lord avebury wishes to achieve by the amendment is clear but it will be no surprise if i say that unless the noble lord can say something else to convince me i fear that i shall be unable to accept his amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord avebury has referred to a figure of but as he will be the first to agree not all mobile homes cost <e> <s> if he seeks my view on a figure of per cent <e> <s> i cannot give this until the results of the consultation paper are in <e> <s> i hinted that many might think that per cent <e> <s> was too much and certainly the situation which the noble lord has described is of a kind which i am sure was never anticipated <e> <s> if the noble lord wants a further comment from me it will only be that as i hope i have intimated i believe there is some merit in the points he was making and that we shall have to wait for the results of the consultation paper <e> <s> i do not think that i can go any further than that today <e> <s> i have said enough to intimate how we feel in general about this point unlike some of the earlier points on which i was taking a more vigorous line if that is the right term <e>", "<cs> again i am in some difficulty <e> <s> these amendments would affect the procedure by which a mobile home is sold <e> <s> the bill uses the same procedure as the act <e> <s> when an occupier wishes to sell his mobile home he must first offer it to the site owner at a fair market price less discount <e> <s> if the site owner decides not to buy it at that price and the price is subsequently reduced the occupier must give the <e>", "<cs> i was not aware that they were to be taken together <e> <s> i am quite content to deal with the first one <e> <s> this is not a long matter and i think there is a greater measure of agreement on this than might be apparent at first sight <e>", "<cs> we are talking here about the intention to restrict the scope of the term family in paragraph of part i of schedule <e> <s> this paragraph enables an occupier to give his mobile home and assign his agreement to a member of his family approved by the site owner <e> <s> it is a new provision not taken from the act <e> <s> we have put it in because we think that an occupier should not in selling his home to a member of his family have to pay a commission <e>", "<cs> i would say similarly to the noble lord lord avebury that it is clear that there is concern on both sides of the committee that some sort of definition is needed <e> <s> i gladly undertake to consider the possibility of inserting a definition at a later stage <e> <s> i hope that will satisfy the noble lord lord avebury and that he will feel able to do as my noble friend lord campbell did <e> <s> we will see what we can come up with <e>", "<cs> the bill allows an occupier to sell his mobile home and to assign his agreement to a person approved by the site owner <e> <s> it also allows him to give his home to a member of his family approved by the site owner <e> <s> in both cases the bill provides that the site owners approval must not be unreasonably withheld <e> <s> this amendment would impose very tight restrictions on a site owners ability to withhold approval <e> <s> it prevents him from imposing a condition on his approval provides that his approval shall be treated as given if it is unreasonably withheld and requires him to show that the withholding was not unreasonable <e> <s> this is yet another point at which the bill follows the precedent of the act <e> <s> and it is another issue on which i am not aware that the act has given rise to any problems <e> <s> here again i must ask whether we should be changing the provisions of the act without a very good reason for doing so <e>", "<cs> let me say at once that i applaud unreservedly the vigour with which the noble baroness pressed the virtues of home ownership <e> <s> i sincerely hope as one who spoke not without some passion on this whole subject at the time we dealt with the housing bill which gave the right to buy that the noble baroness will use equal eloquence to persuade her colleages in another place to withdraw their intentions so expressed of taking away from tenants of council houses the right to buy and that they too should have the right to have all the inheritance virtues which the noble baroness so properly proclaims and to which i too adhere <e>", "<cs> on the latter point i do not know whether or not more people will tend to use mobile homes <e> <s> they may indeed <e> <s> the likelihood is that they will <e> <s> as to whether it will be other than at the margin in relation to the totality of housing i should think probably not <e> <s> if the noble baroness is right in her assumption all the more reason we should make sure that we have a bill like this that it is the best bill we can get and that we do the best we can <e> <s> i do not think that there is any difference between us on that <e>", "<cs> there is absolutely no reason why anyone should not have a consultation paper <e> <s> there can be nothing secret about a consultation paper <e> <s> why not <e> <s> i shall gladly undertake to see that this is so <e>", "<cs> if anyone has made submissions and has not had a copy of course we shall send him one <e> <s> we would not want to start trying to discover anyone who we thought might be given one or ought to have one <e> <s> but those who want one clearly should know <e> <s> i certainly undertake to do that <e>", "<cs> i can only say that the noble lord got here just in time <e> <s> the last sentence of the last amendment of this committee stage and he just made it <e> <s> it is always a pleasure to hear him anyway <e> <s> i think i have the point he makes about the water <e> <s> i do not think that it is relevant to this bill at all but i promise him and he knows that if i say it i will do it that i shall talk to colleagues and if it is felt in any way that there is some merit in bringing it forward then of course i will <e> <s> i truly do not think that there is but he knows that i will do that <e>", "<cs> my lords vesting is cetainly an option which is open to the secretary of state and one which my right honourable friend will doubtless be considering but i cannot today say more about that <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot do that because the numbers and the particular types will depend entirely upon the final scheme that a developer will decide to put on to the land if it becomes available to him <e> <s> the problem as regards the point which my noble friend raises is that at the moment having refused to release the land it is possible that the situation as it has pertained for some years will continue that is that nothing will happen <e> <s> i should have thought that that was a matter for much greater concern than the type of jobs among the to which i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i do so confirm <e> <s> where the local authority is prepared to sell voluntarily and the terms of its lease permit there is currently no problem <e> <s> it can for example grant similar terms as to discount to those eligible under the right to buy <e> <s> the difficulty arises in those cases where authorities are reluctant to sell and the fact that a dwelling is leasehold is at present a loophole which enables them to deny the right to buy <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposals in the bill will have absolutely no effect whatever on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no information on that point <e> <s> i think that as to that one would have to make ones own deductions <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if it would help the noble baroness if i were to point out that the next question on the order paper is the very one which i think concerns the point that is troubling her <e>", "<cs> my lords the statistics for which the noble lord asks me are not to hand immediately but i have said many times in the past and i say yet again that the purchase of a home does not affect one way or the other the availability of the number of dwellings to rent because the people who buy their homes are those who live in them and who have in the main lived in them for many years <e> <s> the fact that they then proceed to occupy and contine to occupy as owner rather than as tenant makes the dwelling neither more nor less available to the general pool of rented accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords we estimate that clause of the housing and building control bill will extend eligibility for the right to buy to secure tenants of approximately dwellings owned by such bodies in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the right-to-buy arrangements for housing associations in the act which confers the right by a reference to public subsidy to an association the right in buy in clause is dwelling specific <e> <s> if the dwelling has been funded with housing association grant the right to buy arises <e> <s> charitable associations will in responding to a notice from a tenant claiming the right to buy be obliged to confirm whether the specific dwelling falls within the terms of clause and in any case of doubt the housing corporation and my department will be ready to assist <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it might be helpful if i were to remind your lordships that as regards the number of dwellings and this is only an estimate but it is one that i do not think will be far out in the end out of the charitable-provided dwellings it is anticipated that some will be affected by these proposals <e> <s> further i would say that the right to buy in this case will not apply if the charity has provided the land if the charity has provided the building if it has funded the construction or conversion or if it has merely received housing association grant to repair or improve property provided by charitable funds even if the amount of the housing association grant is substantial <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from my noble friends question i think it is necessary for me to say that charitable investments are being fully protected by these proposals <e> <s> only a minority of dwellings <e>", "<cs> my lords it really is not for the government at all <e> <s> it is if you like the morality of the right to buy about which we are talking <e> <s> many of us feel that that right to buy is as important to those who occupy accommodation provided in this way as it is in any other way <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that that requires an answer but if the noble baroness insists the answer is of course not <e>", "<cs> no my lords i tried to spell it out carefully and if the noble lord tomorrow will read in <e>", "<cs> my lords then we come to the whole issue of the right to buy and the tightness or otherwise of that <e> <s> the figures i quoted which illustrated that there are some out of such dwellings as the noble baroness mentioned put the matter in perspective <e>", "<cs> my lords i enumerated the circumstances in which the right to buy under this clause will not apply <e> <s> i feel sure that when the noble baroness reads those again carefully she will not be as anxious as she clearly is at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have to bear in mind two points <e> <s> first that what we are talking about here is giving the right to buy to those who live in this accommodation and i do not see for myself why they should be denied the same right as so many other people have who are tenants of accommodation <e> <s> secondly i enumerated the circumstances in which that right to buy will not apply and that is quite an extensive list especially as we are talking here solely about accommodation which has been provided with public funds <e>", "<cs> no my lords i think with respect that that goes beyond the question <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to read a statement which has been made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment in another place <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady birk made her fairly predictable response and may i at once remind her when she talks about the drastic reduction from a per cent <e> <s> contribution when we took office that the record will show that it was the government which she supported which made in one year the largest single reduction ever when the rate came down by per cent <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness will find that interesting <e> <s> she said that not only labour councils but conservative councils would be hard-pressed and would have to put up the rates <e> <s> i would only say that the record shows that last year the labour-controlled councils put up their rates by per cent <e> <s> while the conservative-controlled councils put up theirs by per cent <e> <s> i am quite sure that this year we shall see something not dissimilar <e> <s> the noble baroness said <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the graduated expenditure assessment basis that decides what are the levels of need <e> <s> that feeds through to the grant so it is not good enough to say that <e> <s> the noble baroness said that whereas the statement says <e> <s> this is tough but rightly so she says this is tough but not rightly so <e> <s> we shall have to see about that <e> <s> she would not expect me to agree with her <e> <s> she talked about leeds being good boys <e> <s> leeds used to be good boys <e> <s> today they are better than some but a lot worse than they were at one time <e> <s> i will not say when that time was <e> <s> the fact is that <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer lies not with me but with the authorities themselves <e> <s> i cannot tell the noble lord what they will decide to do <e> <s> that is a decision they will have to take based upon what has been said today <e> <s> i cannot anticipate other than from the budgets which we have received which give certain indications <e> <s> it is now up to the authorities to see exactly how the settlement affects them how the targets affect them what the targets will then be and what decisions they will have to take with regard to their spending <e> <s> at the end of the day what decides the issue is how much they spend because that affects also the grant and the total rate-making ability <e> <s> i am not prepared today to try to anticipate that <e> <s> i hope the message will go home and that they will recognise they have a responsibility to everybody whom they represent <e>", "<cs> my lords the holdback refers to the previous year not to the current year <e> <s> the settlement covers both the holdback for the previous year and the settlement for the coming year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend

to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> it is allowed for in the totality of spending <e>", "<cs> my lords the points which the noble lord makes are major factors in the effect upon unemployment and there are others which he did not mention <e> <s> it would be doing less than justice if we were not to recognise that there are many manufacturers and retailers too who have moved out of areas because they could not afford the rates and who have closed down because they could not afford the extra burden imposed upon them <e> <s> when rates are increased by or per cent <e> <s> in one year when one is trying to operate on the margin in difficult times it is surely wrong not to recognise that this is a factor in increasing unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend and entirely agree with him <e> <s> i see this settlement as offering a great opportunity to local government and i am sure that the vast majority of those in it will take advantage of that opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i have every sympathy with the point that my noble friend had made but i feel i can only say again that the government are very willing to receive any suggestions views thoughts and ideas on this subject that anyone may care to bring to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly agree that any propositions put forward should be <e>", "<cs> my lords from those remarks i am not sure whether the noble lord is himself suggesting that the glc should be abolished <e> <s> i shall note carefully what he has said <e> <s> i really do not think that his observation although very amusing contributes too much to the particular problem that we are considering <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> i am not sure that i am able at this moment to enter into a debate or dissertation upon the whole principle <e> <s> i do not think that really is what the question calls for but clearly there is much interest in the question and i am grateful to my noble friend for raising it <e> <s> i hope that my answers have at least added something to the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord says but i do not think that i can add very much to the answer to the fundamental question as put in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for raising a point which i have made in your lordships house on many occasions in the past <e> <s> i entirely agree with what he says about the great danger of high rates and not least those imposed by way of a precept through anybody not least the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for making a point <e> <s> with his great experience and past in the london local government scene whatever he says has to be followed carefully <e> <s> of course there is much merit in the point that he makes <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be only proper in that i have been trying to answer this question in an absolutely even-handed manner if i were to say that to deny that there is a great depth of feeling among many people in london at some of the actions of the current glc would be to do less than justice to the real concern which exists and the question which has been put is a very proper one <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the question needs an answer i think it answers itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have to agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes really outrageous allegations which all the inquiries i have undertaken do not substantiate at all <e> <s> if the noble lord has specific cases and names which he wishes to bring to my attention he knows that he has the opportunity to do so and i trust that he will do so <e> <s> in the meantime i certainly do not accept that there is widespread corruption where there is contracting out <e> <s> that is a very unfortunate expression for the noble lord to use <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend has made a quite proper suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can best help the noble lord by pointing out to him that trade refuse <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing special about this arrangement <e> <s> the traders were paying before <e> <s> what i am saying and am reporting is that they are now paying per cent <e> <s> less than they were paying before <e> <s> what i would regard as equally important if not more important is that the reports coming to me from the council they will i am sure justify this if challenged suggest that the general standard of service has improved as well as there being a great saving in cost <e>", "<cs> gladly my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord underhill and lord tanlaw for their observations <e> <s> lord underhill said there was need to take into consideration first of all the latest statement issued by british rail on efficiency <e> <s> absolutely certainly <e> <s> i am sure that that is so and i am sure it will be taken into consideration <e> <s> he was concerned about the options proposed a drastic curtailment of the network he said when the statement makes it quite clear that what are put forward are simply options not proposals <e> <s> they are options available and hopefully they will stimulate debate but they are no more than that <e> <s> the noble lord then said that the views of others needed to be considered including those of british rail and i absolutely accept that too they most certainly do and they will be considered <e> <s> i assure him of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for his personal congratulations i thank him sincerely <e> <s> his point about there being no loss of momentum of change is a very valid one and i would suggest that the fact that the work of the committee was first started in may and that my right honourable friend had stressed that he needed to have something without undue delay indicates the governments concern that there should be action that we should not lose the momentum <e> <s> certainly we have no intention of doing so <e> <s> on the other hand there is the point made by the noble lords lord underhill and lord tanlaw <e> <s> i think everyone will go along with those <e> <s> it is very important that if there are to be lasting changes then there is all the more reason that they have to be very well thought through and talked through which is not to say that procrastination is the answer <e> <s> it is not and we do not intend that it should be <e> <s> we intend that there be every opportunity for everyone to put their view albeit not in a long cycle of time <e> <s> on that i certainly assure the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for reminding us that that is precisely what the government are trying to do to strike a balance <e> <s> no one quarrels with the objective of striving for efficiency <e> <s> it is vital when we are talking of sums of this magnitude that we have efficiency <e> <s> there is also the angle of the social aspect of all transport including railways <e> <s> the trick is to find the right balance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i suggest that he discusses that with the usual channels who will best advise him <e> <s> so far as i am aware we have no date as yet for a specific debate <e> <s> the noble lord will do best to raise the matter in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most anxious to stress that the report refers to options <e> <s> it is no more than that <e> <s> i entirely take the point that my noble friend lady vickers makes <e> <s> her main concern is that there should be consultation <e> <s> of course that is right but i want to stress that it is not consultation on a proposition because that is not what the government are bringing forward today <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord lord northfield says <e> <s> certainly everything said in this debate will be brought to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> i feel sure that he will not want to jump the gun at all <e> <s> i understand exactly the point that the noble lord is making and its importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i deeply sympathise with what my noble friend says <e> <s> perhaps mentioning the ministry of defence in particular now that someone else is there they will do it better but they did not do it better when he was in the other department <e> <s> we suffered as much as everybody else <e>", "<cs> my lords what can i say except being on the receiving end as i and my colleagues so often are would that there was a solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i hasten to say that i do not accept that the circumstances are the same as those for flat dwellers not at all <e> <s> bit if the noble baroness is right and if the circumstances were the same <e> <s> i would have to turn her argument round on her by pointing out that if one looks at the effect upon flat dwellers who wish to have accommodation one sees that although the rent acts have had many good effects no one can deny the bad effect which has dried up the availability of supply and if the noble lord lord bishopston is right and i do not quarrel with him about this that there are parts of the country where site accommodation is also difficult he should be as concerned as i am that we should do nothing to make the likelihood of that less likely if i can put it that way <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of this amendment is to impose a penalty on a site owner who fails to offer an agreement under the bill within the required period <e> <s> the penalty would be that the owner could not increase the payments due to him from an occupier to whom he had not offered an agreement <e> <s> like the first amendment we considered a few moments ago this one deals with a subject we discussed in committee and again does so in a less severe way than the earlier version <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords on that latter point i should like to say at once that i am very grateful to the noble lord lord evans of claughton for bringing it out <e> <s> he is absolutely right there is certainly no need for any panic or anything even approaching that <e> <s> the fact is that the sewerage system will not become unusable <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk said that the situation could worsen within two or three weeks but i am sure that all your lordships hope that we shall not be in this situation in two or three weeks time <e> <s> indeed if it lasted that long it would of course be worse than it is today but even then there would be no cause to believe that there would be anything like the disastrous situation which the noble baroness fears <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend with his vast experience of the industry <e> <s> in reply to one of his points <e> <s> i would say that yes i am aware of the earnings level to which he referred <e> <s> it is about an average of the pay of all manual workers <e> <s> i said and i still think that i should not comment in detail on the proposed settlement itself while it is in its present stage of negotiation <e> <s> but and i am sure that i speak for everyone in your lordships house i indeed endorse the wish that the matter be settled very speedily <e>", "<cs> my lords on the latter point the very fact that there is a dispute at all arises because on the one hand there are those who have to take account of the ability to pay on the part of those who at the end of the day pay the bill bearing in mind also what is paid to others while on the other hand there are those as the noble lord said who feel that they need to have more money to take home <e> <s> there will always be differences in such a situation and that is what negotiation and discussion are all about <e> <s> the noble lord asked is not the situation a further example of the unsatisfactory nature of solving pay disputes <e> <s> well indeed it is <e> <s> but when there is a perfect way of doing it i shall be very pleased to hear about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what my noble friend says <e> <s> there are many who have spoken similarly and who have sympathy with that view <e> <s> i think that for today however i should prefer not to comment on that <e> <s> we are most anxious that this matter should be settled <e> <s> what the future would hold in that way is i think and i would suggest properly for another occasion rather than for today <e>", "<cs> my lords only time will tell <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not without sympathy for what is being said here but it is not quite that straightforward <e> <s> there is one respect in which i am quite sure that the approach which the amendment takes is balanced too far against the site owners and that concerns the position of occupiers who are on a site at commencement <e> <s> the amendment would place no time limit on their ability to accept refuse or challenge any agreement <e> <s> this would place the site owners in an uncertain position in respect of everyone who was on site at the commencement <e> <s> apart from anything else site owners would never know when they were likely to be taken to court <e> <s> that does not seem to be fair <e> <s> i am not even sure that it would be entirely in the interests of occupiers to have forever in which to decide <e> <s> i do not think that there is any possibiliy that the government would be prepared to accept that aspect of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are actually going over an amendment identical to one we went over in committee and it will probably be no surprise if i make the same arguments now as i did then <e> <s> the first of them is that the rent officer service is not equipped to deal with pitch fees on mobile home sites <e> <s> i am second to none in my admiration for rent officers <e> <s> i said it on the last occasion and i happily say it again <e> <s> i know precisely how they operate <e> <s> the fact is that the rent officers job is to fix rents for houses and flats within the rent acts but registering fair rents for tenants of houses and flats is not the same thing as fixing a pitch fee which an owner-occupier of a mobile home should pay <e> <s> not only are mobile homes in themselves quite different but surely the critical point is that we are not here concerned with the rent for accommodation <e> <s> mobile home owners are paying for a licence to occupy land and to receive certain services <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill provides that agreements under the bill may be terminated on a number of grounds by the court and the court is defined in the following way <e> <s> in england and wales it is the county court or if the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration any questions or disputes about agreements under the bill an arbitrator <e> <s> in scotland it is the sheriff or again if the parties have agreed to arbitration an arbitrator <e> <s> these amendments are in part consequential on a later amendment amendment no <e> <s> but their effect when taken with this later amendment would be to enable only the county court in england and wales and the sheriff in scotland to terminate agreement <e> <s> the arbitrator would be cut out altogether <e> <s> for the moment i shall concentrate my remarks on the value of arbitration in these circumstances rather than on the grounds for termination <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some difficulty in following the noble lord <e> <s> only a few moments ago he was saying that he was concerned about the courts being clogged up by applications now he is saying do not have an arbitrator but go to the court <e> <s> he really will have to make up his mind which he wants <e> <s> as far as i am concerned the prime matter here is whether or not both sides can receive equity without the necessity of having to resort to the courts <e> <s> yet there can be no harm at the same time in retaining an opportunity should all else fail and everyone be unhappy for either side to fall back on it <e> <s> there can be no harm in having the first as a desirable option which occupiers themselves have said they want and at the same time if all else fails having the right of recourse to the court <e> <s> i see nothing wrong in that <e> <s> i just could not say that we would deny the opportunity for arbitration as an option should the parties decide to have it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord lord evans of claughton was doing very well until he came to his last sentence and spoilt it all <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord will feel the same after he has listened as he always does to what i have to say on the subject <e> <s> i shall be interested to know that <e> <s> we are now in a field where he has practical experience of having to make it happen if i may put it that way and of having to deal with such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the noble lord would not expect me to agree with his side observations about the purpose for which the secretary of state should have powers nor do i but let me remind him if he will allow me that again it is the government who are bringing forward this bill <e> <s> we are doing so precisely because we are concerned about the act which was originally introduced as a private members bill by he who is now my right honourable friend the secretary of state and want to try to improve the balance between the two sides here so as to make it all work better <e> <s> we are concerned that the occupiers should in no way be disadvantaged indeed quite the contrary <e> <s> if we did not feel like that we would not have introduced the bill in the first place <e> <s> we are saying that we want to get the best bill and to get it as right as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what the noble lord has said and obviously i sympathise with the thrust of that <e> <s> but again i <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave of the house and i suppose that i should have been saying that all along because we are on report of course we read everything that is said and we think about it <e> <s> if i had really thought that the way in which the noble lord lord evans in particular had put the matter would have led to that kind of situation i would certainly have said yes we will <e> <s> i can only say to the noble lord lord bishopston that we will read what has been said very carefully and think about it <e> <s> i can say no more <e> <s> that is as far as i can go <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose the test is how substantial is substantial <e> <s> where does one begin <e> <s> the fact is that i believe that the bills existing provisions and the test which they impose are not light <e> <s> the court or the arbitrator is required to consider the age and condition of the mobile home <e> <s> he must be satisfied that having regard to those factors the mobile home is having a detrimental effect on the amenity of the site that is causing the site as a whole to suffer <e> <s> it would not be enough for the site owner to argue that a mobile home was ugly or was of a different make from the others on the site <e> <s> he must show that the age and condition are such as are harming the site <e> <s> it is unlikely to be an easy matter for a site owner to persuade a court that an agreement should be terminated on those grounds when the mobile home has in reality a good many years life left in it <e> <s> i doubt it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say as i said on an earlier amendment that i think there is some merit in this point <e> <s> i certainly cannot undertake that we shall bring this matter in here at this stage or whatever but i feel as i felt before that there is some merit in this argument <e> <s> i would not want just to turn it down <e> <s> if the noble lord withdraws his amendment i promise him that we will consider this <e> <s> i will undertake that the matter will be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment deals with another aspect of the sale of a mobile home and the basis on which a site owner may withhold his consent to a sale <e> <s> the amendment will also apply to the provisions for the gift of a mobile home <e> <s> it is another amendment that we had at committee stage and substantially there is not much i can add to the points i made then <e> <s> the bill uses the same approach as the act to the site owners consent to the assignment of an agreement that is it stipulates that consent must not be unreasonably withheld <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the bill covers this but it would help my noble friend if i were to say why i think so <e> <s> the bill at present provides that if an agreement allows a site owner to resite a mobile home elsewhere on the site the new location must be broadly comparable <e> <s> this sub-paragraph re-enacts an important provision in the act with two minor changes <e> <s> first the bill does not use the earlier provision which enables an owner to move a home to another part of the site temporarily while essential works say are carried out subject to reinstatement either in the same position or a reasonably equivalent one <e> <s> and secondly the bill replaces the phrase reasonably equivalent with broadly comparable <e> <s> this sub-paragraph is designed to ensure that if a site owner has the right to re-station a mobile home the occupier does not suffer as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill provides that if an agreement enables a site owner to resite a mobile home elsewhere on the site the costs of that move must be paid by the owner <e> <s> the costs of moving involve not only the physical moving of the mobile home from one pitch to another but also the costs of reconnecting essential services such as water sewerage and so on <e> <s> the act required a site owner to reconnect services <e> <s> it did not specifically provide for him to meet <e>", "<cs> my lords the question really turns on the extent to which it is fair to compare <e> <s> the fact is that the amendment would go much wider than schedule to the housing act <e> <s> it would require site owners to provide summaries of costs irrespective of whether pitch fees are related to the cost of the services <e> <s> when this matter was raised at committee <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and with the leave of the house i should like to make perhaps a last comment at this stage <e> <s> it is most unreasonable for the noble lord to say that the bill attempts to treat mobile home occupiers as second-class citizens <e> <s> if that were the case the bill would not have been produced <e> <s> i should like to remind the noble lord that in it was not his government who produced a bill to deal with mobile home occupiers <e> <s> everything that i have said throughout all the stages of the bill and on all the amendments has been in an attempt to show how we are trying to hold a fair and reasonable balance not least on behalf of the occupiers <e> <s> that is what we have done that is what we shall go on doing and i do not accept what the noble lord says as to that <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way may i respectfully suggest that this is quite a red herring that he is drawing across the debate <e> <s> this is not the issue at all that is under discussion at the present time <e> <s> if we are to have a debate on the rights or wrongs of nuclear deterrents i am sure there have been and will be plenty of opportunities to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting is it not that the noble baroness lady fisher complained that she was concerned that there was too much government intervention whereas the noble lord lord rochester was concerned that there was not enough government intervention <e> <s> i think we will have to get the two acts together <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to noble lords and noble baronesses who have spoken and for the very helpful remarks which they have made and i thank the noble lord lord jacques for his congratulations <e> <s> the noble lord <e> <s> lord bishopston intrigues me as ever when he talks about the new powers i now have i am still waiting to find out quite what they are <e> <s> but i have no illusions about the new responsibilities because they are very apparent <e> <s> the noble lord also spoke about the time i have at the weekends <e> <s> he really must take me to one side and tell me what he means by that i should like to know more <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i would like to repeat a statement being made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment in another place <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful particularly for the restrained manner in which the noble baroness and the noble lord have responded i feel that that is essentially the right approach at a time like this whatever one might think or say one way or another as to the level of the offer <e> <s> it can only be a view we express and it cannot help those who are trying to negotiate on both sides <e> <s> for that reason i do not wish to go any further unless i am pressed by your lordships and even then i think a viewpoint would not be helpful <e> <s> there are those whose job it is to get this matter sorted out <e> <s> the one thing we all want is to see that it will be done as quickly as possible <e> <s> there are people who really are suffering hardship <e> <s> no one wants that <e> <s> i hope that everybody concerned i am sure they are is well aware of that fact <e> <s> that is why there is nothing i want to add to what has been said so far <e>", "<cs> the financial guidelines were published yesterday and i have arranged for copies to be placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords we have sat and listened for five hours to hardly very flattering observations but not once did we interrupt in any way whatever <e> <s> the least that my noble friend can expect is that he too should have the same hearing as we gave to the other side <e>", "<cs> my lords it splits up at per cent <e> <s> on projects aimed directly at economic regeneration per cent <e> <s> on projects concerned with the physical environment and the balance of per cent <e> <s> on a variety of other programmes mainly involving the voluntary sector <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not agree <e> <s> with respect to the noble baroness the question was directed specifically at the urban programme which as she knows is a special programme only for the inner cities <e> <s> i should have thought that the figures quoted were very dramatic <e> <s> if anyone had said four years ago that over million would be put into the inner cities everyone would have held up his hands and said eureka <e> <s> this is the answer <e> <s> but of course we knew that it was not the answer <e> <s> it is what it should lead to that will be the answer <e>", "<cs> no my lords not at all because to ask that question is to miss the whole point <e> <s> the whole point is that the noble lord is referring to the revenue spending <e> <s> whereas the principal objective of this money is to try to bring back the capital investment in the inner cities which has been falling so much for so long <e> <s> also it is to bring in the private and other sectors which alone can do what is really needed to be done in the inner cities <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would allow me to respond to that in my other remarks <e> <s> i will certainly come to the point <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect it is not a question of whether or not they have failed <e> <s> i have no reason to say other than that they have not failed <e> <s> what we are talking about is something different something which would be better something which will as i hope to bring out later not be a constriction or a constraint but something which will give more scope and opportunity to the ordnance survey <e> <s> if my noble friend will permit me i shall try to bring that out a little later when i speak again <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason for the brevity of my speech was that it was simply to set the general <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to begin by congratulating along with others the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey on his maiden speech <e> <s> i look forward in particular to having many debates with him on other issues in which we have a common interest <e> <s> i entirely endorse what has been said about his splendid contribution and his interesting view of the subject which we should do well to look at <e> <s> i am sure that will be taken up <e> <s> i take the point made by the noble lord lord hunt who suggested that i had a monumental task in convincing your lordships of the merits of the governments case <e> <s> all i can say is not for the first time <e> <s> then i also take some comfort from the knowledge that at least in your lordships house one receives a proper hearing and that your lordships are willing to listen and take heed of arguments which are made fairly <e> <s> would that it was always so everywhere else my lords <e> <s> finally before i embark on what i have to say i should like to express my gratitude to those of my noble friends who have felt able to support the governments case <e> <s> some of them made very telling points and i shall come to them <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking of a delay which no-one can quantify <e> <s> i submit that it would be probably all of a year and it may even be longer <e> <s> there is no reason why one should not in any case take the advisory boards views for discussion when the order is laid in another place and make their views public for use in debate on the order <e> <s> but to delay i think is not acceptable <e> <s> the fact is that over the past few years the ordnance survey has been subject to several studies and reviews and i think the time has now come to give them a clear remit to which they can work <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord says as to that and clearly he has special expertise <e> <s> i shall be glad to pass on his observations and if necessary to write and tell him if those are the intentions <e>", "<cs> my lords that helps very much because now i will write to my noble friend and answer his questions <e> <s> my noble friend appeared to be suggesting that the introduction of a trading fund would make the director general the accounting officer for the commercial activities of the survey while the doe would provide accountability for the rest he argued that not only was this a split of responsibility which was undesirable but it was contrary to the recommendations of serpell <e> <s> i have to tell him that the introduction of a trading fund would not create this situation <e> <s> i am sure he will be pleased to know that under it the director general would remain accountable for all ordnance surveys activities while the doe would be responsible merely for making payment under the terms of a contract <e>", "<cs> my lords i am assuming that my noble friend is directly questioning the need for some accountability in situations where that is called for <e> <s> i am quite sure that if necessary the director general would go to the pac <e> <s> i should imagine so <e>", "<cs> well my lords i can only say that the intention which i keep trying to emphasise is that the government and the ordnance survey wish to continue the standards of serving customers and the quality of the service this will be equal to what has gone before and will in no way be less <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships will allow me to continue and develop my remarks i intend to come to these points <e> <s> i am endeavouring to cover a lot of material <e> <s> it would be easy to gloss over these points but i prefer not to do so <e> <s> if your lordships will allow me to develop them i will <e>", "<cs> the decision of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment not to intervene in this case was made after careful consideration of all the issues involved <e> <s> call-in powers are only used where planning applications raise major non-local issues <e> <s> cases are considered on merit and i can assure the noble lord that the decision in this case not to intevene represents the secretary of states assessment of the issues raised no more and no less public inquiries will continue to be held in appropriate cases <e> <s> non-intervention does not however imply endorsement of the proposal it remains the duty of the local planning authority to take the structure plan and all relevant factors into account in determining a planning application <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baronesses who have responded to the statement <e> <s> perhaps i may reply to them fairly briefly <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk referred to the effect on those who are involved and those who are if i may put it that way on the receiving end of the worst parts of it <e> <s> i think there can be no disagreement between us as to that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i finish first and then the noble baroness will have another chance <e> <s> the noble baroness asked are the government involved in the inquiry refusal <e> <s> these are negotiations taking place between both sides in a sensitive area and i am not today any more than i was before about to get into trying to place blame or apportion responsibility at all <e> <s> i am concerned as is everyone in the house to see that we allow both parties to get on with it and we should encourage them to do so and stress the importance of their doing so <e> <s> i should have thought that was the most constructive thing we could do <e>", "<cs> there is a slight confusion here my lords <e> <s> i certainly endorse to the best of my knowledge the figures my noble friend mentions that the offer would take the average earnings of i think up by about a week <e> <s> but i think the p to which the noble baroness lady birk was referring was the additional amount of productivity earnings that it was stated by the union side would be the effect of them taking the additional amount that was being suggested by the employers side <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i understand the position the authority that i mentioned at least implied that its resolution was for that reason but beyond that i cannot go at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have seen recently or have heard of a number of instances where local authorities have passed resolutions declaring their intention not to give contracts to firms who carry out work for bodies or other people whom they do not like <e> <s> of course the government deplore this very much <e> <s> the criteria should be whether the work will be done satisfactorily whether it will be done at the lowest possible price and whether the company concerned is sound in every way <e> <s> i cannot think that in the interests of those they represent there can be any other factors that they ought to take into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the point that my noble friend makes <e> <s> i would prefer it if he would allow me to say no more than that we are looking very closely into this particular case to ascertain just what is the legal position <e> <s> i assure him that it is not a matter that we are about to leave without the closest investigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept the point that the noble lord makes in talking about extra constraints <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be read a second time <e> <s> when the government announced last july their intention to introduce transport legislation they gave four objectives firstly to ensure greater certainty and stability for public transport secondly to improve efficiency thirdly to obtain better value for money and fourthly to <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has this last eight days sat on this bench for probably six hours at a time on a number of occasions noble lords would i think expect me to be sympathetic to the basic point made by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> however in all fairness and equity noble lords may also agree that i always try to listen to speeches of any length from either side without interference relying on the good judgment of those concerned to bear in mind that a debate is taking place <e> <s> i am sure that in this case the point made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is fair <e> <s> having said that i am sure that my noble friend lady gardner must be nearing the end of her very interesting speech <e>", "<cs> i believe that my noble friend meant to refer to the noble baroness lady denington <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill we have been debating is basically about securing the future for public transport in london and our major cities <e> <s> for the last years we have witnessed a steady decline in the use of local buses and trains <e> <s> as use has declined costs have increased but fare levels have been held down so the burden of financing local transport has fallen more and more on the ratepayer and taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords i was illustrating the point why local government is in the situation where it feels the centre in a number of areas is coming more and more on top of it <e> <s> the point that the noble lord makes is in itself valid because we are talking here about a potential next year of million of subsidy <e> <s> the noble lord may feel that that is not very much but it is significant <e> <s> it has doubled in the last two years and in two years time the total figure could be over million and no government will stand by and watch that <e>", "<cs> very well my lords i do not wish to spoil what i think is an excellent case by distortion <e> <s> i take the point that the noble lord makes <e> <s> of course rents are also a factor <e> <s> there are other factors as well <e> <s> i do not seek to imply it is only rates far from it <e> <s> i think the case is so good that it does not need any distortion <e> <s> it has to be said that it is not just london that we are talking about we are talking about many areas in the country <e> <s> only time prevents me from reeling off place after place and giving facts and figures <e> <s> if any noble lord wants them i shall gladly write to him <e> <s> these are very significant points <e> <s> the noble lord lord marsh made them as well as anyone <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not saying that <e> <s> i am saying that the whole position needs clarification and that it is in everyones interest that we should have that and that is one of the things which the bill sets out to do <e>", "<cs> that does not make it any more right so far as i am concerned my lords <e> <s> that one does not throw me one bit if it is not right it is not right <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never known the noble lord lord sefton not talk about anything that he wants to talk about at any stage of a bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness and to the noble lord for their helpful comments <e> <s> perhaps i can respond to the noble baroness lady fisher as follows <e> <s> she asked what were the particular projects <e> <s> there are of them <e> <s> i do not propose to read them all out <e> <s> they cover a very wide range of types of projects <e> <s> they cover housing and as i said in the original statement much construction they are to do with sports and recreational facilities they are to do with industrial development of one kind or another <e> <s> in some cases they are commercial but they are all helpful in that and this is the key point they involve the private sector in putting up a big share <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i think that the noble baroness is probably right in her implication <e> <s> perhaps the term itself is slightly misleading <e> <s> i think that is so <e> <s> it is bidding in the sense of making application <e> <s> i hope that that is helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord peart who has such a great knowledge of the north-west <e> <s> he is right to stress that area because in terms of derelict land it is almost certainly the area that most of all needs help with that particular kind of grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry would the noble lord repeat the last part of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point my understanding is that there have been some schemes rejected <e> <s> it happens to coincide with the number approved <e> <s> i hope that that illustrates the fact that we are very carefully appraising these schemes <e> <s> i suspect that in the second and later batch that percentage will probably fall <e> <s> i hope that it will <e> <s> it is a beginning and clearly in the first flush of enthusiasm it would not have been unreasonable to expect lots of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for bringing that point out <e> <s> he is absolutely right of all parts of the country the midlands were in very many ways leaders <e> <s> it does not come easy for a yorkshireman to say that but i think it has to be recognised that that is so <e> <s> we are trying to encourage this but the noble baroness was also right when she said that in some ways it is a pity that designation of need has to be made <e> <s> it would be nice not to have to so designate <e> <s> but even leeds is so designated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that the opposition parties have ever produced a scheme to involve the private sector together with the public sector in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness and the noble lord for their comments <e> <s> if i may very briefly respond the noble baroness lady fisher said that i presented the figures to the governments best advantage <e> <s> i was presenting the figures whether they are to the governments the trade union sides the national water councils or anybody elses advantage is something i cannot control i present the figures as they are <e> <s> the noble baroness said that principles are not always equated to pounds shillings and pence <e> <s> i would probably agree with her philosophy if that is what it was but i think that this whole dispute like so many other disputes brings into account philosophies and all that goes with them and i fear i cannot be helpful by proceeding down that road <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the first point concerning evidence of increases in productivity and whether this will have to be shown prior to payments being made i think not <e> <s> i think that i read out from the statement quite a list of items which attract these additional payments <e> <s> i would not be able to say that any productivity benefits would be there before the increases were paid <e> <s> they will be paid and as always there is the hope that there will be increases in productivity <e> <s> but on guarantees that this will be so beforehand i think that i will have to say no <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord diamond refers to the governments stand on an incomes policy <e> <s> i believe i am right in saying that the government do not have a stand on incomes policy <e> <s> we do not believe in an incomes policy as such <e> <s> that policy has not been found in the past to work at all and we have no reason to believe that it will be any more successful in the future <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be helpful if i explain the reasons why the minister of agriculture fisheries and food is being given the power to appoint members to water authorities and why we decided that <e>", "<cs> i find that my noble friends are answering for me better than i can do <e> <s> the point raised by the noble lord lord ardwick puts the matter into context <e> <s> what kind of people will there be on the boards <e> <s> as my noble friend lord nugent rightly said the record shows that there should be executives from <e>", "<cs> there you are <e> <s> what did i tell you <e> <s> the fact is that the functions of land drainage and fisheries are statutory obligations with statutory committees <e> <s> that is why there are the two maff members <e>", "<cs> in speaking to the two amendments nos <e> <s> and the purpose as has been said is to write into the bill the provision that the local authorities should have a right to a proportion of the membership of the new small boards <e> <s> this runs counter to the approach which we have adopted in the bill <e> <s> we have not attempted in the legislation to hypothecate individual places to particular interest groups <e> <s> the principle which we have put forward is that all appointees of the new boards should meet the primary qualification for membership which is that they must be able to make an effective contribution to the management of the industry <e>", "<cs> if we had been dealing only with the amendment i should clearly have made some observations upon it <e> <s> but the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal has gone as we say where i come from very much over the top <e> <s> first what a coincidence that the letters which she has quoted arrived three days before this debate was due to take place <e> <s> how interesting <e> <s> the noble baroness and others say come on <e> <s> the noble baroness knows as well as i do that it is not very difficult to orchestrate such things to arrive in good time <e>", "<cs> noble lords may well say that but we have listened to such expressions as lack of confidence if local government representation is lost <e> <s> i can only assume that nobody listened to what i said <e> <s> i said quite clearly that the representation would be two to four <e> <s> i reiterated that the governments intention is that that should be the representation <e> <s> i say it again and if necessary i shall go on saying it <e> <s> the noble baroness has attacked the basis of these committees <e> <s> the fact is that this was voted upon properly and passed by the other place and forwarded to us <e> <s> it is a method of running these authorities which will not take away from people rights which they may hitherto have enjoyed <e> <s> it is an attempt to try to give back <e>", "<cs> the writing into the bill of a number is one thing <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley for the way in which he put this point because he summed up the difficulty very well <e> <s> the question of a number is one matter the question of the right to nominate as such is something else <e> <s> the committee may recollect that when making my response i majored if i may use that term and placed the main emphasis of my response to the amendment initially moved by the noble baroness lady nicol on this question of nomination <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend says this is indeed a modest amendment and if i may say so after the previous debate has been presented very modestly and and moderately <e> <s> would that i were able to accept it <e>", "<cs> may i make just a few brief observations <e> <s> i was amused when the noble baroness <e> <s> lady fisher said that they are all equal <e> <s> i am sure that everyone is equal but some are always more equal than others <e>", "<cs> one could hardly have listened to a more reasoned small debate <e> <s> i have every sympathy <e> <s> i was always so delighted in the past when i saw how through the water space amenity people and others there was such a greater use of water for recreation in the area from which i come <e> <s> i always thought that was marvellous <e> <s> as i hope your lordships will know i always had tremendous personal attachment to sport and recreation and everything that goes with it <e> <s> i am certainly not unsympathetic at all to the underlying point that the noble lord lord melchett makes and indeed confirmed so ably by my noble friends and others who have said something about it <e>", "<cs> this point has been made to us before <e> <s> we feel that what is now proposed with the new composition of the boards and their small numbers creates a new situation <e> <s> there is no question of understanding the concern here and indeed more than the concern the desirability as put by my noble friend lord nugent but it seems that the arrangements made at regional level referred to under clause which we think need not cut across the existing satisfactory arrangements will provide all that is required <e>", "<cs> if the scenario as described by the noble lord lord winstanley were to come about i entirely agree that it would be unfortunate <e> <s> perhaps i omitted to comment certainly i should have done in my opening remarks on whether or not it will be possible as my noble friend lord onslow said to have someone who is not only a maff man but has knowledge of recreation and so on <e> <s> i do not know but i suppose that will be possible <e> <s> although as i said we have difficulty in accepting an amendment which would make it obligatory i would hope indeed i would give an assurance on the point that when making appointments the degree of experience in the fields about which we are talking in the authority as a whole is a matter we should certainly want to consider <e>", "<cs> there are one or two points that i should like to make <e> <s> first of all section of the water act already statutorily binds water authorities to further conservation <e> <s> i think the noble lord will agree with me about that <e> <s> i make that point also if i may especially to my noble friend who raised that aspect of it <e> <s> clearly there is much concern on this point yet as the noble lord lord melchett properly said if i do not really believe that i can consider it with the possibility of being able to come back with something then if the committee have to give a view i would sooner have that view given now and so be it <e> <s> that is why when i say i will look at something and consider it <e> <s> i say it in a way to be helpful but i cannot always guarantee <e>", "<cs> we have already debated the need for what i might broadly term agriculture members when we were debating amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> perhaps i should first explain that land drainage and fisheries are two functions of the water authorities for which they are statutorily required to establish committees <e> <s> they are not so required for any of their other functions <e> <s> in england these functions fall within the ambit of the minister of agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> he is therefore given the power to make these appointments <e> <s> although for reasons which i have explained it is most unlikely the situation could possibly arise where the minister might wish to appoint a farmer with no experience of land drainage or fisheries rather than someone with experience of those functions and to provide for this the word agriculture is included within the ministers remit <e>", "<cs> would i include it as a matter of form <e> <s> we are very concerned about including in the <e>", "<cs> it begins with our doing the homework <e> <s> whether that eventually leads to the noble baroness having to do more homework of her own will depend presumably upon the conclusions that we reach <e> <s> what i said was that there were certain aspects of it that we want to look at <e> <s> as i say when i have done that i will straight away inform the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal and the noble baroness lady nicol and all who properly should be informed <e> <s> then it will be up to them to decide whether or not what if anything we propose is acceptable <e> <s> they will then <e>", "<cs> i have to say that it was not in that spirit that i agreed at all <e> <s> i agreed to it because i thought that there was merit in the points that were being made and i wanted to look at it on those grounds <e> <s> my noble friend of all people would not really want me to say that i was doing it for the reasons that he implied <e>", "<cs> at present there is no requirement on the secretary of state to consult with anyone before he appoints the members of a water authority <e> <s> the suggestion posed in the amendment would be an unusual provision certainly in a nationalised industry context <e> <s> it is not customary for ministers appointing chairmen or members to public corporations to be required to consult trade unions or any other interested groups <e> <s> if one thinks about it carefully it cannot be right to do so <e> <s> the doctrine of ministerial accountability to parliament is well entrenched in our system and rightly so <e> <s> but when the accountability is in effect accountability for the actions of a body like a water authority then there is an important corollary <e> <s> it is that the minister alone must be responsible for appointing members of the body for which he is answering <e>", "<cs> despite the extravagant way in which the noble lord made his point let me simply tell him exactly what i did say which was that the consultations to which i referred are at ministers own initiative <e> <s> i then went on to say that they are the ministers own responsibility and in no way diminish their responsibility for the ultimate appointment <e> <s> that is the point which the noble lord was making and it is one that i made in saying what i did <e>", "<cs> first may i say that of all the speeches which we heard at second reading the one which most impressed us as everyone would properly have expected was that of the noble baroness lady scrota <e> <s> it focused very clearly the anxieties of the house <e> <s> as she pointed out the bill proposed to remove the right established by parliament in that any citizen might ask for an independent investigation when it was felt that there had been injustice through maladministration on the part of a water authority <e> <s> the noble baroness emphasised the powers of the local ombudsman to investigate a complaint in depth <e> <s> without going into the matter in the way that otherwise i should have done i have to say that the noble baroness impressed us very much with her arguments <e>", "<cs> i am not aware that the making of orders is a point before us at the moment <e> <s> if the noble baroness will enlighten me i shall be glad to reply to her <e>", "<cs> it may be that i am missing the point that the noble baroness is making but i will certainly look at this and write to her <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may present the governments view on this amendment <e> <s> i have been listening with much interest as i did at second reading to what has been said <e> <s> i should like to say at the outset that the government consider this to be a matter of major importance to the overall objectives of the bill <e> <s> let me try to explain why <e> <s> no executive board of the kind which controls a major undertaking in the public or private sector throws open its meetings to the press and public <e> <s> why is that <e> <s> first it is because there is now doubt and those who say otherwise are not being fair because in this committee there is a mass of experience in this area that the presence of outsiders at meetings of this kind has a profoundly inhibiting effect on discussion <e> <s> people will not speak up as freely as they would in private <e> <s> to deny that is simply to turn ones back on reality <e> <s> that is not the whole of the story <e> <s> let me put it another way <e> <s> in democratic assemblies we accept unreservedly that the access of press and public to a debate is not only desirable but i go further and say it is essential <e>", "<cs> no i did not say that <e>", "<cs> we have found them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very aware of and i concur with what my noble friend has said <e> <s> as to what government do about it he will know better than most people in your lordships house that that is something that one does not quickly or lightly decide upon <e> <s> today the most that i would want to say is that this causes the affairs of the authority to be under greater review than ever <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am so aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to say that this information is not available <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the concern with regard to this publication and indeed i answered questions on the point in this house not so long ago <e> <s> really at the end of the day it is a matter for the district auditor to decide whether or not this is a proper application of public funds ratepayers money and so on <e> <s> i think it would be helpful if i were to tell my noble friend that suggestions have been made to the district auditor that this is not so but the final adjudication as to that must lie with him <e>", "<cs> my lords it really has nothing at all to do with whether what is in these publications is to support or to go against the governments policies <e> <s> it is all related to whether or not this kind of money ratepayers money in particular should be applied to this kind of thing <e> <s> that is really what it is about <e> <s> it has nothing at all to do with government or government policies <e> <s> as i said before whether it is or is not a proper use of ratepayers money is for the district auditor to decide and i assure the noble lord lord avebury that there has been no shortage of <e>", "<cs> my lords i consider it a matter of priorities and i would question very much whether it is a great priority for an authority which says as most authorities do that it would like to apply more money to the application of services but it is always short of funds to do this <e> <s> if it is a priority of such an authority to spend money on running campaigns against government policies then i think it will really have to answer to the people it represents for what it does not provide <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend knows that i have much sympathy with what he has just said but i suggest that that is slightly aside from the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the second part of the noble lords question he must take a view on what is said and like it or not that will be for him to decide <e> <s> as to whether or not the district auditor should disallow to the best of my knowledge his duty is to decide whether the spending of money on publications of this kind or anything else come to that is a matter that is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may feel that it is right to do as he says <e> <s> but i would only respectfully submit that in the doing of it there is a duty to take account of what you spend of other peoples money to make your case and to consider whether it is reasonable to spend million or million <e> <s> i am horrified to think that money is spent on publications of this kind <e> <s> when i remember how carefully we counted every penny of other peoples money that we spent in my former incarnation i am even more horrified that this kind of spending takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey will not be too surprised if i tell him that our case does not rely too heavily upon what was said by denis healey <e> <s> it may be helpful if i explain that the purpose of clause is to help make clause the break-even provision effective and a real commercial discipline <e> <s> under clause an executive has to ensure that revenues cover charges so far as practicable in that year <e> <s> clause as drafted ensures that this requirement to break even is a real discipline <e> <s> it does this by requiring an executive that fails to cover charges by revenue and consequently makes a deficit to make good that deficit the following year <e> <s> clause makes the deficit from the preceding year part of the charges which have to be covered by revenues in the following year <e> <s> this seems to us to be sound financial judgment <e> <s> the new financial duty however does not provide a financial straitjacket <e> <s> the section requires the executive to break even <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that the planning process provided for in the bill places the initiative for the preparation of the plan with the executive and thereby fundamentally changes the relationship between the executive and the authority <e> <s> the noble lord has suggested i will not use the word alleged which some have suggested to me that this undermines the existing basis of democratic control <e> <s> the noble lord also expressed concern during the second reading of the bill that the plans should be prepared jointly by the executive and the authority <e> <s> but such a change would in fact alter the whole relationship proposed under the bill <e>", "<cs> i enjoyed as i always do the impassioned speech of the noble lord lord sefton <e> <s> no one does it better but i had great difficulty in seeing where we are differing <e> <s> i have always had that difficulty in the past and i am still having it <e>", "<cs> the bill is not yet on the statute book <e> <s> therefore nothing is or can be done that has effect in law <e> <s> however if the department is doing as the noble lord says and i am assuming that it is doing so although i really do not know then it is learning as it goes because at the end of the day it will have to make certain judgments <e> <s> it can in any case do no harm <e> <s> in my own knowledge and certainly in the knowledge of all the noble lords opposite who have spoken on this today who all have considerable local government background it is absolutely par for the course for departments to be talking with the various bodies and discussing various matters <e> <s> the noble lord may fear that there is something sinister in this and from where he sits he may be right but i suspect not <e> <s> i would not attach too much concern to that <e>", "<cs> i honestly feel that the noble lord is not right <e> <s> i am sure that he believes that he is right but i think his concern is not properly founded <e> <s> it is exactly as i said <e> <s> if he will read carefully what i said as i am sure he will without my going over it all again he will find that at the end of the day the decision on the adoption or otherwise is with the authority <e>", "<cs> only if it decides as a matter of policy <e> <s> if the authority not the executive decides as a matter of policy to go above the pel as it may well decide as being reasonable to do then and only then can it be challenged <e> <s> but the ultimate decision lies with the authority <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> at least i now clearly understand the concern in a way that i may have missed previously <e> <s> but i am still absolutely convinced and i hope to be able to satisfy him that in fact it is not so sinister a matter it is not such an erosion if i may put it that way of the local autonomy situation <e> <s> i take the point that the noble lord lord sefton made when he said that i was a staunch defender of local democracy i hope that i always will be <e> <s> the matter that seemed most to concern the noble lord was the rectitude if that is the right word but it probably is not of passing a plan to the authority and at the same time to the secretary of state <e> <s> the noble lord asks why should it have to go that way in that sequence <e> <s> the bill specifically requires a secretary of state to give guidance that is the operative word as to the pel <e> <s> if in fact he was to wait until he had an agreed plan from the authority rather than having it come to him at the same time from the executive that would be the end of the day <e>", "<cs> that just is not my interpretation of it at all <e> <s> i am reading the same clause as the noble lord <e> <s> it means exactly what i said it meant before and if you want me to go over it again i shall be glad to do so <e>", "<cs> you can interpret it one way or the other <e> <s> i still think that my interpretation is correct but it matters not because at the end of the day the final decision lies with the authority <e> <s> at the end of the day it decides <e>", "<cs> the bill says quite clearly <e>", "<cs> i would not know about weasel words but the fact is that it is there in front of us <e> <s> i think that my interpreatation is right <e> <s> it is indeed advice but at the end of the day the decision is the authoritys and it will decide <e> <s> when we are talking about local autonomy to me that is what matters <e>", "<cs> one of the prime purposes of the bill is to introduce a planning process into the assessment of transport needs so that transport services can be planned and provided for on a stable and rational basis <e> <s> accordingly the scheme of the bill provides for one grant determination each year based on proposals set out in the plan <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill said the purpose of the amendment is to enable an authority to provide additional grant during the year to cover any unforeseen circumstances which of their nature would not be provided for in the plan <e> <s> this would mean that an executive could for example negotiate a high wage settlement or for some reason or another increase its level of services and cover the additional costs through increased grant from the authority rather than by reducing costs elsewhere or increasing fares <e> <s> that would constitute very poor financial practice and would seriously weaken the new financial duty on the executives to break even <e> <s> thus the amendment would encourage inefficiency dare i say it <e> <s> and loose management and cause ineffective financial control <e> <s> that could not be in the best <e>", "<cs> i have not a great deal to say on the amendment <e> <s> i suggest that if it were accepted it would distort the purpose of paragraphs <e>", "<cs> what i am saying today is the latest stuff if i may put it that way <e> <s> i think that it is basically correct <e> <s> if in due course i have any cause to feel otherwise i shall immediately inform the noble lord <e>", "<cs> rather than mention it now i shall write to the noble lord and send him the chronology of the planning process in a normal year <e> <s> it might help him in considering what he might later want to do about his proposal that is assuming that he does not want to do something about it this evening which of course he may decide to do <e> <s> i think that if i were to do that it would be helpful <e> <s> i hear what the noble lord says and i too have been to the tyne and wear metro <e> <s> indeed i opened part of it myself <e> <s> i found it very impressive and i like it very much <e> <s> i hope that it proves to be as successful over the long term as it looks as though it might be over the short term but only time will tell as to that <e> <s> i feel that i cannot help the noble lord any further on this matter <e> <s> i have explained why we cannot accept the amendment but clearly the noble lord will want to consider further what i have said <e>", "<cs> let me first say that the government entirely accept that wider considerations of the kind described by my noble friend ought to be and indeed must be taken into account when planning the provision of transport services <e> <s> but our difficulty in accepting this amendment is that clause is concerned with the duty of the executive to submit precise estimates of those factors which are directly related to the services which they provide their cost the level of demand for them and the benefits which they produce <e> <s> the wider considerations are different in kind from this and would be largely outside the control of the executive <e> <s> we do not therefore believe that it would be appropriate to widen clause <e>", "<cs> i am interested in what the noble lord lord northfield has said <e> <s> may i think about that and see what the current thinking is on the point he makes <e> <s> i will certainly do that and of course i will get in touch with him as he knows i always do <e> <s> as to the amendment let me first say that the government entirely accept that the factors of the kind outlined by the noble lord lord underhill ought to be and must be taken

this group of amendments seeks to remove the role of the secretary of state in the planning process and his initial advice on the preparation of plans and final guidance on the appropriate levels of the revenue support <e> <s> i do not believe that they are in the best interests of the executives or the authorities <e> <s> the main purpose of the secretary of states initial advice and final guidance figures is to inform the planning process which leads on to the time when the authority decides on its plan and on the level of subsidy knowing that subsidy up to the secretary of states guidance is protected from legal challenge <e> <s> that surely is a good thing <e> <s> if authorities keep within that guidance they would be able to provide transport services in a stable atmosphere and protected from challenge <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may say what he says and i say what i say <e> <s> the fact is that we are being pressed to try to keep matters broad and not to pin things down <e> <s> then the noble lord says no what we want is chapter and verse written in every move you make so that you specify exactly what will be the list of criteria and so on <e> <s> he will not get that at all from me <e> <s> the noble lord should look carefully at the bill <e> <s> we had a long debate earlier when there was a difference on form and procedures and there is still a difference about that and the understanding of it <e> <s> but the one thing we will not do is try to give chapter and verse for the kind of criteria <e> <s> it would make no sense to do so <e>", "<cs> the problem with that scenario would be that the authority would have no indication of the governments thinking which is what they would need to have <e> <s> when the debate took place earlier i wrote down a few comments <e> <s> i did not speak then because my noble friend was dealing with the matter <e> <s> but i very carefully wrote down a few lines as to the exact route if i can call it that of how it proceeds the plan is prepared by the executive after <e>", "<cs> i just do not see it that way at all <e> <s> the fact is that the authority does not just endorse the plan it considers it and it decides upon it <e> <s> the fact is that the bill requires the executive to consult the authority before making its plan <e> <s> this is really a continuation of the discussion that we had previously <e>", "<cs> clearly we are not going to agree on this <e> <s> i did not respond to the noble lord lord pitt on the same point when he said that the executive prepares its plan in consultation with the ministry <e> <s> that of course is not the case at all <e> <s> there is no provision for consultation with the ministry only for advice from the secretary of state <e> <s> but there is a requirement for consultation with the authority <e> <s> that is the key point which i keep coming back to all the time <e> <s> clearly we just do not agree <e>", "<cs> the fact is that if the authority decides that it does not want to take the advice it does not have to but if it does not and we come to the point that is being lost here then it has to realise that it leaves itself open to legal challenge <e> <s> up to the point that it takes guidance on the levels of subsidy then it is absolutely protected in a way in which it is not protected today <e> <s> that surely is critical <e> <s> that is one of the absolute tenets of the whole bill that there is protection up to a point if this advice is taken but if the authority decides not to take the advice so be it <e> <s> at the end of the day the final decision lays with the authority <e> <s> they are the people who have to decide it <e>", "<cs> may i say first that the government fully accept that the secretary of state must issue his advice in good time for authorities and executives to take account of it <e> <s> indeed as a target the dates set in the amendment are i think not unreasonable <e> <s> the problem however is that the amendment goes further than setting a target <e> <s> it creates a statutory limit <e> <s> the noble lord recognises that that is the difficulty <e> <s> in unforeseen circumstances the secretary of state would be bound to issue his advice even if all concerned were agreed that there needed to be a delay <e>", "<cs> i admired the speech of the noble lord lord sefton with its underlying sympathies and i like to think that the attitude underlying it is very much my own <e> <s> i too am very concerned about the central-local government relationship and anything that can be done to improve that relationship must be a very big plus because goodness help us should the day ever come when local government becomes as he feared it might become <e> <s> i do not think that local government is like that <e> <s> perhaps it has been moving in that direction but this is not the occasion to philosophise though dearly i should like to do so because i feel very deeply about the matter <e> <s> perhaps there will be another occasion on which to do so rather than at this time of night tempted though i am <e>", "<cs> again the noble lord lord tordoff explains why there is concern <e> <s> i think that i understand that <e> <s> the proper course for the authorities to carry out consultations if they wish to do so would surely be to do this and incorporate the views expressed in the plans before the plans are submitted to the secretary of state <e> <s> i shall come in a moment to the point which the noble lord made but i should like to follow the thread <e> <s> so they might wish to consult after receiving guidance from the secretary of state and before determining the grant and approving the plans <e> <s> the final responsibilities for the plan and for the provision of public transport lie with the authorities <e> <s> it is for them to decide whom to consult over the provision of those services <e>", "<cs> one is of course trying to be helpful <e> <s> when the noble lord quoted from <e>", "<cs> clause sets out the matters to which the authority is to have particular regard in assessing the executives plan <e> <s> these are <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could return the noble lord lord underhill to the reference he made to columns and of the proceedings in another place <e> <s> in fact there is no inconsistency between the words of the under-secretary of state on that occasion and what i am saying now <e> <s> it will save the noble lord from looking if i read out exactly what he said <e>", "<cs> if the record needs to be put straight and i do not think it does i am sure my noble friend lord teviot will confirm not least because of his very great knowledge in this whole field that i feel obliged as i do with most of your lordships with special know-how if i may use that term on matters of this kind to take note of what he said and to look carefully in case there might be something we ought to be doing <e> <s> after all the main purpose of your lordships house is to revise to look at and get the best bill that we can <e> <s> that is what i said i will do and i will <e> <s> if in referring to those who were affected by the bill i did not mention every category i would have assumed that it was implied <e> <s> i referred to the interests of the ratepayers and users and of course this includes others who are affected by the bill <e> <s> i think that is implied in what i say all along <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes me to <e> <s> i will gladly reel off a lengthy list each time i refer to these in the remaining stages of the bill <e>", "<cs> certainly the authority can and indeed hopefully will look at everything and as widely as possible but we want as is written into the bill at the moment the emphasis to be on the use of the word particular because that directs the authority towards these issues which we again say that we particularly want them to do <e> <s> that does not prevent them from looking at other things as well <e> <s> that is up to them <e> <s> but certainly one could not write into the bill such a wide generality <e> <s> we are concerned in the bill to have the word that directs them particularly to these factors <e> <s> that is really why we do not want to change the drafting of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am glad to hear the confidence that the noble lord shows <e> <s> he shows confidence in the present administration we will have no problems with that <e> <s> i assume therefore that he would certainly not expect to have problems with another administration which might perhaps be closer to his heart <e> <s> either way he has to win <e> <s> he has it covered both ways <e> <s> i only want to say again that it is not a question of a restriction on the authority it is a question of the <e>", "<cs> i have made no further inquiries since oclock last night along the lines that the noble lord mentions <e> <s> but i repeat that to the best of my knowledge there were in fact consultations in so far as the government were able to have them but the noble lord knows as well as i do that the local authority associations as such who have a great deal of expertise and input in these matters chose for whatever reason not to be involved at that stage <e> <s> i understand that now there will be consultations before the bill is passed and hopefully even at later stages <e>", "<cs> the noble lord knows that i always delight in writing to him <e>", "<cs> we have already debated under amendment no <e> <s> and the related amendments the effects of removing the secretary of states power to give guidance to the authorities as to the maximum amount he considers appropriate for revenue support <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat all those arguments again but amendment no <e> <s> would in essence have the same effect <e> <s> it would limit the secretary of states guidance simply to the broad economic principles on which revenue support should be based leaving authorities to determine the levels of revenue support by reference to any other factors they choose <e> <s> the government cannot accept this proposal <e>", "<cs> in case it will help the noble lord i had thought that it might be helpful to the committee in response to the noble lord lord sefton if i were to go over those points again <e> <s> so the noble lord may wish to refer to them <e>", "<cs> i suggest that the noble lord lord mcintosh considering the authority from which he comes should not be talking too much about extreme political dogma <e> <s> and when he talks about incitement by my noble friend to the glc in respect of illegalities well need i say more <e>", "<cs> i have to smile when the noble lord accuses us of indulging in second reading debating points <e> <s> yes we sometimes rise to the bait <e> <s> the noble lord lord sefton of garston smiles unapologetically for making such points all the time and i certainly do not object to them so long as we recognise them for what they are and i suppose why not make them on a bill of this kind which concerns people so deeply <e> <s> for myself i make no real complaint as to that provided that i am not criticised when in return i respond in like kind <e>", "<cs> i should be rather astonished if the government has to bring back to parliament every note of guidance to every authority <e> <s> i should have thought not <e> <s> should it be otherwise i will tell the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i do not think that this amendment is in the best interests of the authorities and i am sure that it stems from a misapprehension as to the secretary of states power in clause to suggest modifications to the plan <e> <s> the purpose of that power is to enable the secretary of state where his guidance differs from the levels of subsidy which the authority propose in their plan to suggest to the authority ways in which their plan might be changed in order to comply with his guidance <e> <s> but just as the authority can ignore the guidance so too can they ignore these suggested amendments to their plan <e> <s> the authority are not bound to the modifications suggested <e> <s> because the provision appears near the end of the clause your lordships might feel that it is the last step in the proceedings <e> <s> this is not so <e> <s> the last step occurs in fact under the provisions of subsection where the authority are left free to decide the plan and the level of subsidy <e>", "<cs> on the point which has been made about information may i say that rightly or wrongly information is not being demanded of ptes <e> <s> my noble friend lord teviot made a good case as to why it is necessary to have certain information <e> <s> i doubt whether many would quarrel with that argument <e> <s> however the fact is that a consultation document is in existence <e> <s> it sets out proposals for the content of the plans <e> <s> we are looking forward to receiving the views of the ptas and the ptes on it which indicates that we want it to make sense to them as well as to the government and to everybody else concerned <e>", "<cs> one of the great weaknesses throughout has been the refusal of the association even to talk about this matter <e> <s> the noble lord says that there has been no consultation on the white paper <e> <s> they did not respond to the wish for consultation <e> <s> this document says quite clearly these are proposals <e> <s> come on ptas come on ptes <e> <s> we want your suggestions about what should be in the plan <e> <s> make your suggestions <e> <s> then let us talk about them and agree them together <e> <s> that to me makes sense and i am sure that it makes sense to the noble lord lord sefton of garston <e>", "<cs> that we should discuss it and if you do not like what it says let us see what else you suggest <e> <s> that is what it means <e>", "<cs> what is the noble lord referring to <e>", "<cs> probably it conveys as much to me as it does to the noble lord lord sefton <e> <s> but that is not going to help either him or me <e> <s> it is there for discussion and that is what i expect to take place <e>", "<cs> may i say first of all as i did when amendment no <e> <s> was moved that the government are very sympathetic to the point the noble lord is making <e> <s> indeed we fully accept that the secretary of state must issue his guidance in good time for authorities and executives to take account of it <e> <s> my goodness <e> <s> i have been in many situations myself when i needed that kind of guidance or decision far sooner than i was able to get it <e> <s> so i certainly appreciate the point the noble lord makes <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asks me a very good question <e> <s> i really cannot think offhand of an example of course i may have egg on my face for saying that <e> <s> i shall certainly check and i shall write to everybody who ought to know not least because i am fascinated myself <e> <s> i do not think there is such a case but i shah certainly be in touch and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> i think that it would be true to say that the wording of the amendment bears two interpretations <e> <s> one might be that when the secretary of state gives his guidance as to the maximum amount of subsidy which would in his view be appropriate for the coming year under clause he should also give directly comparable guidance as to the amount of subsidy that would be appropriate for the two following years <e> <s> i would hope that there was general acceptance that such an approach would import far too great an element of inflexibility into the planning process <e>", "<cs> i understand the thrust of the argument and obviously from the authoritys point of <e>", "<cs> i was about to continue and say that here we are dealing with something which would be a figure excluding the authority from legal challenge <e> <s> so clearly it needs to be as close as it can be <e> <s> no figure given could be taken lightly <e> <s> it is a guidance figure but it is a very important figure <e> <s> to try to put this two or three years ahead is something i doubt any secretary of state regardless of political complexion would ever want to do <e> <s> the noble lord should put himself in that position <e> <s> after all who knows the noble lord may have the problem to decide one day <e> <s> the noble lord should think of himself in the position of a secretary of state setting figures below which there can be no legal challenge and being asked to state those figures for two or three years ahead <e> <s> i think that is a nonstarter <e>", "<cs> the noble lord knows how tempted i always am by a suggested compromise <e> <s> clearly we will look at what he says but i think that we shall still come back to the basic problem i mentioned <e> <s> what we actually intend is to give advice in the spring under clause in relation to the plan and the amount of grant which in the secretary of states view is appropriate for the executive to determine as the basis for its plan <e> <s> at that time we shall give any advice which we are prepared to give in relation to the second and third years <e> <s> when the guidance is set in the autumn the authority and the executive will know of any such advice <e> <s> because i know how useful it would be i say what i do about it but i think that in practical terms to give a figure in one year which two years later could be used when it comes to challenges or <e>", "<cs> the problem here is that the noble lord lord mcintosh is quite right when he says that this amendment would defeat a principal objective of the bill to provide stable efficient and cost-effective local transport <e> <s> the amendment would enable an authority during the year to redetermine and increase <e>", "<cs> there is not a lot that i want to add to what i said previously but there are one or two points which are pretty fundamental to the debate on this amendment <e> <s> the secretary of state of course will take into account all representations before he sets pels <e> <s> the bill specifically says that the financial duty is to break even so far as practicable <e> <s> the special circumstances to which the noble lord lord mcintosh refers might well result in a proposal for increased grant in the following year <e> <s> in my view the bill is in fact flexible when it says so far as practicable <e> <s> there is a whole host of flexibility in that phrase and i am sure that the noble lord will concede that point to me <e>", "<cs> the only thing reasonable about this amendment is the way in which the noble lord presented it <e> <s> one of the main purposes of the bill is to provide legal protection to a reasonable level of subsidy while leaving ratepayers with their present rights to challenge excessive levels of subsidy <e> <s> it could be said that the bill actually reduces the rights of ratepayers in relation to challenging levels of revenue grant at or below the guidance <e> <s> this is what the present clause does in the interests of providing stability and protection from challenge to authorities if they choose to keep within the protected expenditure level <e>", "<cs> the bill is not only about the national economy <e> <s> that is part of it <e> <s> i wish first to comment on the remark of the noble lord lord mcintosh that we are debating the nub of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill said it was just another amendment <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> i did not once try to interrupt the noble lord while he was speaking <e> <s> perhaps he will allow me to complete my argument and then i am sure he will have his chance to comment <e> <s> i feel every bit as passionately as he does and as does his noble friend lord mcintosh about local government and its future <e> <s> i am very anxious about what i see is happening and nothing we are proposing openly in the bill is in any way i say this again to the detriment of local government <e> <s> on the contrary it makes clear beyond doubt exactly where they will stand and what they may do <e> <s> at present it is not clear what they may and may not do <e>", "<cs> we have said that we introduced the bill in part because of the legal challenge made to the authorities powers to give revenue grants to their transport executives <e> <s> those challenges pointed up the differences and obscurities in the legislation governing the glc and the metropolitan county councils <e> <s> subsection of the existing clause at once removes that lack of clarity and puts the glc and the metropolitan councils on a common footing <e> <s> these amendments would seem to aim to achieve those same effects but less clearly and with one difference they would provide legal protection to any level of subsidy determined by the authority in accordance with the planning process rather than to expenditure up to the level of the secretary of states guidance <e> <s> that is a very fundamental difference <e>", "<cs> it has been very fascinating listening to such eminent members of the legal profession and it makes my own legal qualifications seem very humble <e> <s> on the point of the law as it stands at present following on that which was said by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey the noble lord was saying that the glcs new proposals are legal <e> <s> i must point out that in the recent action between the glc and london transport the judges found that the glcs proposals for a per cent <e> <s> fares reduction were a valid exercise of its powers but the court did not explicitly decide whether the proposals struck a reasonable balance between the interests of transport users and the interests of ratepayers <e> <s> lord justice kerr said <e>", "<cs> i shall not make another speech <e> <s> i shall just say that there is a difference between us <e> <s> we have talked it out at great length and anything that i said now would be bound to be a repetition of what i said before <e> <s> there is a difference which is deeply held on both sides and if the noble lord lord underhill wishes to put the matter to the committee then he must do so <e>", "<cs> in many ways this is a very strange amendment for noble lords opposite to be moving <e> <s> the provisions of clause are important to ensure that all parties are kept informed during the planning process <e> <s> the effectiveness of that process would be weakened by this amendment and i do not think that that would be in anybodys interest <e> <s> if the secretary of state is to give advice to executives under clause it is necessary that the secretary of state should be able to call for such information as he thinks necessary in order to ensure that the advice is sensible and meaningful <e>", "<cs> i have already said but probably i ought to repeat it that a consultation document is in existence which sets out the proposals for the content of the plans <e> <s> we are looking forward to receiving the views of the ptas and the ptes <e> <s> i should have thought that that was the time for the authorities to put their cents in <e> <s> i shall call it more than cents if the noble lord would like me to do so <e> <s> to answer the noble lord that must be an important point <e>", "<cs> i cannot tell the noble lord what the build-up was to the document in question <e> <s> i just do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> this was part of a process of discussion and negotiation <e> <s> if the noble lord feels that it was less than adequate in some way i can make no comment but i will certainly find out and let him know <e> <s> he knows that i will do that <e> <s> i will tell him exactly what the position was <e>", "<cs> that is a question of which comes first the chicken or the egg <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord tordoff can turn words around but if it helps i will make another observation to the noble lord lord sefton of garston on the document <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether we consulted on the document beforehand <e> <s> the answer is that we did not because it is a consultation document <e> <s> we put it out to get the authorities views <e> <s> again one can go round and round the consultation asking where does one start and where should one have started but i do not believe it takes us that much further <e>", "<cs> i really think that gets us absolutely nowhere at all <e> <s> as the noble lord will find the longer he is in your lordships house and in committees when the day comes that everybody knows everything that he thinks they should know we shall have reached the millennium <e> <s> we shall never reach that point <e>", "<cs> it is important that authorities do not vary fare levels upwards or downwards without taking particular account of the effects of such a variation both on the executives ability to meet its financial duty and also on the need to achieve balance between the interest of the ratepayers and the users <e> <s> this is particularly important after the amount of revenue grant has been determined for the year because once set it is not to be increased <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the concern of the noble lord lord underhill in tabling these new clauses <e> <s> of course he will know that the serpell committee in chapters and of its report discussed the whole question of rail closures and bus substitution procedures <e> <s> the report commented on the unsatisfactory nature of alternative bus services provided in the s and proposed a new approach to the routine financing of replacement services with the railways board responsible for the provision with services provided under contract by nbc or other contractors and with the financing of unprofitable services provided by central government to channel through <e>", "<cs> if beaming it is then i am doing so because as so often the noble lord lord howie of troon started so well in what he said and then spoiled it at the end <e> <s> i did indeed i hope respond to the noble lord lord underhill in a not unsympathetic way because there is room for great debate here <e> <s> i understand the concern about the debate going on and on <e> <s> after all we are not talking about a new situation this is a situation that has pertained for so long <e> <s> there has to come a time when someone comes forward with firm proposals and makes decisions and we seek not to turn away from that at all <e> <s> however in terms of the amendments today i am sure the noble lord lord underhill does not expect me to be able to accept them and nor do i i referred earlier to the governments general intentions and to the fact that we want to look not just at serpell but at issues which he did not cover but which must be important as well <e>", "<cs> the noble lord knows that i cannot give those undertakings there is no way in which i can <e> <s> i cannot tell him when there will be a decision on serpell <e> <s> i cannot say to him no there will be no closures of this kind nor can i answer the other point <e> <s> in my answer i have tried to indicate that the government are not unsympathetic to what the noble lord says but as regards giving him undertakings i cannot and i suspect he knows that i cannot <e>", "<cs> i just cannot say whether it will be a matter for another transport bill in the next session or whatever <e> <s> would that i could but i cannot <e> <s> i understand everything that is being said and i can only say as i do very often and in good faith that of course we shall consider very carefully what has been said <e> <s> i recognise that that is unsatisfactory in many ways to the noble lords lord mishcon and lord underhill and come to that the noble lord lord howie of troon <e> <s> but the fact is that i am in no position to go further than that and i just cannot do so <e>", "<cs> it is not the fear of the action to be taken that moves me as much as the merit of the case that has been made <e> <s> i can go so far as to say that we will certainly consider what has been said <e> <s> i give that undertaking <e> <s> but it may well be that if we come to a later stage and we come back with nothing that will satisfy the noble lord he will have to do what he has to do <e> <s> that may or may not satisfy him today i hope that it will <e>", "<cs> i cannot give instances <e> <s> i understand that there have been one or two situations they have not been many and i do not know when they took place <e> <s> hopefully they have not occurred very often and even more hopefully not very recently <e> <s> but i do not know and i cannot say <e> <s> of course i will happily write to my noble friend lord teviot and i shall also send a copy of the information to the noble lord lord underhill <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord underhill explained the effect of this series of amendments would be to allow the authorities powers under section of the transport act to stand rather than be repealed by the bill <e> <s> this provision was discussed at great length by the standing committee in another place and in particular the date of the repeal <e> <s> however let me set out the effect of this section and the purpose of the repeal <e>", "<cs> there is not much that i can add to what i said earlier <e> <s> as always the noble lord lord mishcon makes the matter sound very straightforward and i am sure that from where he sits it appears so <e> <s> would that it were all so straightforward to the rest of us <e> <s> i said as indeed did the noble lord lord underhill that we thought that it was a matter that was not so easy to understand and appreciate and i am sure that when i read it in due course i shall still think the same <e> <s> but the fact is that one has to take a view at the end of a day <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that if such a situation presented an opportunity to provide buses earn revenue and one hopes make a little more for the festival what the noble lord has mentioned would be a most desirable thing to do <e>", "<cs> the bill states all along that there is a duty on the authority to break even so far as is practicably possible <e> <s> i should have thought subject to anything that i may later come back to that if the provision of extra buses in the kind of circumstances that the noble lord envisages has an effect on the outcome on the authoritys financial requirements that would be perfectly in order <e> <s> but i should not think that the situation would arise because i should imagine that the authority will be taking such a point into account long before the festival starts and people begin to arrive <e>", "<cs> as always the noble lord lord sefton of garston speaks with great eloquence and sincerity <e> <s> i respect that very much <e> <s> unhappily the fact is that there has been very little dialogue with the authorities concerned on this subject <e> <s> as the noble lord knows the subsidies have gone on rising quite dramatically over the period million million and million <e> <s> they were talking of over million in <e> <s> the noble lord cannot claim truly that we are talking about authorities which have the slightest intention of having a serious dialogue along the lines which the government envisage <e>", "<cs> again i say that i understand the sincerity with which the points are made but i am sure that noble lords certainly the noble lord lord beswick with all his great experience would be the first to acknowledge that a government could not put off for a year what is being proposed here <e> <s> it is fair to say that the secretary of state has been considering the relevant material as i described to your lordships on a previous day of the committee the authorities have known the provisional guidance figures and in fact they have known them since th november last year <e>", "<cs> no this is the committee stage <e>", "<cs> the point i want to make is that in fact the authorities have known since november last year <e> <s> they have been asked whether there are other matters they want the secretary of state to take into account <e> <s> so by the time the bill is enacted the authorities will have had many months to submit material to us and the secretary of state will be ready to issue his guidance <e> <s> the basic point about the provisional figures in the white paper is that they are just that provisional <e> <s> the secretary of state has no power to set figures before the bill is enacted <e> <s> in fact when the ama came to see him last autumn they pressed for advance indication to help them in preparing their budgets and that is what he gave <e> <s> but he made it clear he was ready to consider any relevant material supplied by authorities before setting the actual figures <e>", "<cs> i suppose in theory they could <e> <s> in practice it is not very likely <e>", "<cs> may i just say again that the main purpose of clause and the redefined financial duty is to strengthen the financial disciplines on the executive to operate commercially <e> <s> this new clause would enable an executive to use ratepayers money to build up nest eggs and to use them to cushion itself from the normal vicissitudes of a trading operation <e> <s> the pels will be set to reflect the appropriate level of support needed from the authority by the executive to cover a deficit <e> <s> it surely cannot be right for the secretary of state to ignore the extent that the deficit is to be covered by appropriation of reserves <e> <s> that would result in reserves supplementing revenue grants instead of substituting for them <e>", "<cs> may i first assure your lordships that the government look with favour on any measures designed to help the unemployed and young people involved in the youth opportunities programme <e> <s> the problem is this is this an appropriate means as my noble friend lord campbell of alloway says of achieving that objective <e> <s> we do not think it would be appropriate to include people in these two categories the very restricted group of people for whom local authorities have the power to provide concessionary fares under section of the transport act <e> <s> that section gives local authorities the power to provide concessions for three groups who have already been talked about so i will not go over that again <e>", "<cs> we have had a very good debate although some may think that it was more appropriate to a second reading than to a committee stage <e> <s> but that seems to be a fate to which i am committed <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend lord nugent will be gratified by the very constructive nature of the debate and certainly i welcomed it for that <e> <s> i too am speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> perhaps i may say at once that my noble friend lord nugent has clearly thought out his proposals with great care as we would expect of him <e> <s> nobody underestimates the importance of this subject <e>", "<cs> i shall respond equally briefly to that point <e> <s> i made it clear at least i thought i did that i was responding to an amendment tabled by my noble friend and indeed to the noble lord lord irving of dartford <e> <s> i said quite clearly that i thought it would be wrong to deal with this in isolation for this industry <e> <s> but we must also recognise that my noble friend is fully justified in bringing forward this amendment because here we have a new situation that is arising through this bill for the water industry <e> <s> what pertained previously will no longer apply <e> <s> that is previously there was the national water council which conducted negotiations but this will not be there in future under this bill <e> <s> therefore it is perfectly proper at this time for my noble friend or anyone else to bring this forward as an alternative <e> <s> it is not for me to answer for my noble friend he will do that much more competently than i can but that is how i understand it <e>", "<cs> that might be helpful <e> <s> i had intended to speak to this amendment and to amendment nos <e> <s> a and <e> <s> i understand that the usual channels have discussed the matter so with the leave of the committee i will deal with those also <e>", "<cs> i am not without sympathy to what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> the government are not in the business of concealing what the water authorities are doing <e> <s> it is just as important that the public have access to information about the authorities decisions in the future as at the present <e> <s> perhaps i could quickly outline what we are doing to secure the objective <e>", "<cs> i said there would be a note of the proceedings <e>", "<cs> perhaps this is a matter we should discuss <e> <s> we have an open mind on it because we agree it is important <e> <s> the noble baroness will appreciate that minutes can be written in all sorts of ways <e>", "<cs> indeed and it will not be easy to get an exact clarification because it is something that needs to be in the bill i accept that <e> <s> perhaps we can pursue the matter and the noble baroness will not find the government unwilling to consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords government policy is in line with the gleneagles agreement the commonwealth statement <e> <s> it was agreed upon by commonwealth prime ministers and indeed only they can amend or revoke it <e> <s> as recently as th november last in another place the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord says and i am sure that the house welcomes any move in that direction <e> <s> but i think it would also be proper for me to say that in so far as the noble lord refers to the blacklist of course the government cannot and will not support any instrument that requires us to control the free movement of our sportsmen <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what my noble friend says <e> <s> i used to say that that phrase which i learnt on arriving in your lordships house usually meant that that was the end of that <e> <s> in fact i hasten to assure my noble friend that so far as this question is concerned that is not the end of that <e> <s> i hear what he says with much interest as i am sure do many other members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is good to hear of relaxations of the type to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that there is evidence to suggest that this is taking place <e> <s> it will be welcomed by everyone <e> <s> if it eventually reaches the point where it is acceptable to the commonwealth and other prime ministers it will have the desired effect that i think all your lordships would want it to have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i score lots of points on my own side by taking that point of view but i think it is equally proper to understand that there is real concern and a genuine feeling by many of your lordships not least many of my noble friends that if there were indeed to be closer activity on a multiracial basis it would contribute a great deal towards improving the whole of the climate <e> <s> that is a view very strongly held by many of my noble friends with which i know many of your lordships on the opposite side would agree <e> <s> the point here i think is that the government stand by the agreement <e> <s> i think that we have to act in accord with those in the commonwealth and that is what we are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords just as i said to my noble friends i understand what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> he states a point of view which may or may not be right <e> <s> i think that there are others who would say that the point of view which they espouse namely a greater integration and coming together might also contribute towards the end objective which i know the noble lord lord avebury wants to see <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord wakefield would probably concur with that view <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are now moving very wide of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i would want to think about what the noble lord has said <e> <s> offhand i do not think that i could give that assurance but i would want to consider the matter <e> <s> i have made the offer to the noble lord lord underhill and i assure the noble lord lord sefton that the offer applies equally to him <e> <s> frankly i do not see that what he has said in any way takes anything away from the offer that i have made <e> <s> if he comes forward if not now at a later stage because there is time to think about it with any particular form of benefit which he feels could not be referred to in the plan i promise him that i shall look at it in the way in which i have already said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill will not mind i know if in responding to amendments which are similar and in some cases almost identical to ones we had at the earlier stage i say the same things <e> <s> one tries to be original the whole time but it is not always possible <e> <s> if i think the case was made fairly at the earlier stage then i cannot do much better than say the same again <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord sefton of garston very frequently asks whether i will give assurances as to what the department will or will not say <e> <s> of course i cannot do that because i do not know exactly how these points will transpire as they are put into practice <e> <s> there are perhaps others better qualified than i to say that <e> <s> as with most matters of this kind we are trying to set up a rgime which is clearly understood and which sets out what authorities and executives must do in submitting their plans taking guidance and coming to conclusions <e> <s> i am with the noble lord in wanting within that framework the greatest degree of flexibility possible <e> <s> i do not want to encourage rgimes which make it impossible for an authority or an executive to act i do not want that at all <e> <s> as we come to further amendments we shall see why the government feel that the whole bill is necessary <e> <s> it is with that point in mind all the time that i respond in the way that i do to the present amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must seek the leave of your lordships to speak again and i must apologise for not having done so when i last rose <e> <s> i am very grateful to my noble friend who as so often goes straight to the root of the matter and puts it in very logical and i am sure precise terms <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that it is important that in preparing the draft plan the executive should make an assumption about the appropriate level of grant and that that assumption must be made in the light of any advice given by the secretary of state under clause as to the amount of grant that it would be appropriate for the executive to determine <e> <s> these are important provisions because if the secretary of state is to provide protection from challenge to a reasonable level of subsidy it is surely only sensible that at the initial stages of the plan the executive should be required to take into account any advice which the secretary of state gives about the kind of figure that he has in mind <e> <s> it is also right that at least an element of the plan should bear some relation to any initial advice which the secretary of state has given <e>", "<cs> my lords i should perhaps remind the noble lord lord sefton of garston that if the government are as concerned as he says about getting the legislation through in time then the quickest way of doing it is to do precisely what he says that is to agree to amendments and everything that goes with it <e> <s> to resist them is not to speed up the process at all <e>", "<cs> i will my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord really misses the whole point of what we are seeking to do <e> <s> i keep saying it again and again <e> <s> the fact is that the government are entitled to bring forward their legislation and your lordships house is the place to modify that and to make sure that there are no drafting errors such as the noble lord refers to <e> <s> it is the place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not correct in saying that the benefits he quoted shall not be taken into account <e> <s> it is said in the departments cost-benefit model that these benefits are not to be taken into account but the authority and the secretary of state can take account of them <e> <s> when the noble lord reads my remarks carefully he will see there is a big difference <e>", "<cs> not for the first time my lords <e> <s> i disagree totally with the noble lord <e> <s> when he reads what i said on the subject he will see that i gave a full and total answer to the point made by the noble lord lord underhill <e>", "<cs> my lords at first sight these amendments might seem to be a logical consequence <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon prayed in aid the romans with his latin quotation and he prayed in aid the medes and the persians <e> <s> he was at his usual eloquent and most persuasive best <e> <s> i think that some of the points he made by themselves i would have to say have some merit <e> <s> that sounds terribly patronising but the noble lord knows that it is not meant to be that but is meant sincerely <e>", "<cs> well my lords so far i am doing well but i am afraid that i am going to have to disappoint the noble lord in the end <e> <s> the fact is that the secretary of state has to decide and to give guidance he needs information <e> <s> that is what clause is about <e> <s> but the need of the secretary of state for information does not prevent an authority from asking for its own advice with the plan for example under clause and giving its views to the executive under the consultation arrangements <e> <s> i will come back to this point in a moment and to the point that the noble lord lord mcintosh made and indeed all noble lords are making as to why this amendment should be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i could go on much longer and the noble lord knows that i could <e> <s> i believe this deeply and with a passion equalling that which i know is sincerley held by noble lords opposite <e> <s> my concern about the amendment is genuinely that it would lead to confusion if the secretary of states requests under clause were ranked alongside those of the authority so that the executive could then choose between them <e> <s> however i recognise that here we are only talking about what i consider and i know that noble lords opposite feel differently are very much the mechanics of the operation <e> <s> i intend and i say this despite the advice i have been given to read carefully what has been said <e> <s> the noble lord knows that i can make no commitment and that will doubtless be a disappointment to him <e> <s> however i intend to read what has been said and if i and my colleagues feel that there is the expressed intention of really making it a better and more logical procedure without adding to the confusion which i fear is the case then we would of course want to come back to it again <e>", "<cs> my lords when we discussed this issue during the committee stage i indicated that it was important that in giving advice the secretary of state should have sufficient flexibility to take account of the individual circumstances of each area <e> <s> this really is important <e> <s> it is true as this new subsection seems to recognise that certain aspects of the secretary of states advice will contain some common elements particularly on the method of assessing the benefits of grant <e> <s> nonetheless the difficulty with the amendment is that it would create a system that we fear will be too inflexible and would not provide sufficient flexibility to take account of local factors and local circumstances <e> <s> i know that that is certainly not the intention of the noble lord lord mcintosh <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to develop the matter as i go along <e> <s> the fact is that i do not think that this new provision would at all help the authorities or the executives <e> <s> the new subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house perhaps i may make a quick response <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill knows that if one starts trying to write into a bill a consultation process where does it <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would require the authorities when considering executives plans not only to have regard to the matters listed in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has misunderstood me but if he wishes to continue i can assure him that i am listening very carefully to what he is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to giving guidance there is not a division of a total sum of money in the circular rather there will be a letter to each authority setting out the pel and giving other indications <e> <s> it has not yet been decided what will be the form of the initial advice for <e> <s> an analogy with block grant as i said earlier when we were discussing rate support grant is not really applicable <e> <s> it is true that there is an in-depth and long-running consultation period with the local authority associations on rate support grant which concerns block grant as well and that as the noble lord will be aware is quite an involved procedure so i do not see the analogy with what we are discussing here <e>", "<cs> my lords following our discussion in committee i have as i promised my noble friend lord campbell of alloway and the noble lord lord mishcon looked again at the wording of clause <e> <s> it might be helpful if i began by reminding your lordships of the purpose of the subsection <e> <s> it sets out the matters to which the authority is to have particular regard in assessing the executives plan <e> <s> these are first the cost of provision of services and facilities and the level of demand and benefit to users secondly any advice given by the secretary of state to the executive on the appropriate amount of revenue support on methods of determining benefits derived from revenue support on the form and content of the plan and on the methods of determining costs levels of demand and benefits to potential users and thirdly the need to achieve a proper balance between the interests of ratepayers and users <e>", "<cs> my lords the general duties of the authority and the executive set out in the and acts are very important <e> <s> it is right that when the secretary of state is considering his guidance he should have a specific remit to take account of these general duties <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord underhill and those noble lords who sit opposite would have criticised the government very strongly had the government suggested that the secretary of state should ignore or override these general duties in setting the pel <e> <s> yet here noble lords opposite seem to be saying that one should not take into account the general duty unless the authority or executive specifically request it and that even then one should take account only of what information they give about the duty <e> <s> if that is not so the noble lord lord underhill will tell me <e> <s> however this seems to me to be very confused <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall our interesting discussion in committee on a similar albeit wider amendment <e> <s> then the noble lords lord mcintosh and lord sefton of garston eloquently put the case for the authority to be able to make more than one grant determination in the year <e> <s> we felt then that we had to resist because this struck at the heart of the bill <e> <s> we have here basically similar amendments which allow for an authority to pay additional grant where the authority and executive consider that this is necessary because of circumstances of an emergency nature <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i can comment on that <e> <s> on the particular point we are talking about that is the definition of an emergency what the noble lords suggest is not without its attractions <e> <s> if one took that by itself perhaps not that formula but something like it it might be possible to cover such a definition of what is an emergency <e> <s> certainly i undertake to talk to my colleagues about that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene very quickly i would not have thought that necessarily follows <e> <s> i am open to correction <e> <s> when i look at the other points i will look at that too but i would not have thought it was necessarily so <e> <s> i could be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am assured that i am right in what i say <e> <s> i hope that is helpful <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i actually have more difficulty with this because although the amendment is very similar in purpose the fact is that it would provide for the opportunity to make more than one grant determination where the existing grant becomes inadequate because of circumstances beyond the ability of the executive or the authority to control <e> <s> this again provides an opportunity to circumvent the planning procedures and indeed it has to be said even an excuse for slack management which is just what the bill is trying to prevent <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say at once that of all the amendments we clearly cannot accept this one <e> <s> i am in exactly the same dilemma as the noble lord lord sefton how do i avoid making second reading points and yet answer what has been said <e> <s> i shall try and do as the noble lord did and i think he did it very well <e> <s> he did it fairly shortly and i shall try to do the same <e> <s> i shall try as he did to contain the depth of feeling which i have on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords in clauses and <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that in a way this is a probing amendment for ironically what was said was never actually reached in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords while my noble friend turns the pages perhaps i can repeat the point which i think states it clearly which is the statement that <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the bill states the amount up to that which is legal and the noble lord lord sefton is right that beyond that if challenged the authority have to have a case to justify to the courts that above that figure was reasonable and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave of the house and if the noble lord will allow me i think it may be helpful if i were to write to him and to the noble lord lord sefton of garston on the legal interpretation as we see it to see where it takes us <e>", "<cs> my lords surely that is up to the local authority itself to decide <e> <s> the noble lord so often reminds us that authorities should act under their own powers and practise autonomy <e> <s> i am sure that this is a case where the council will take note of his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the housing and building control bill might be said to mark my coming of age in your lordships house <e> <s> it is the twenty-first bill that i have had the privilege of presenting to your lordships <e> <s> as its title suggests the bill falls into two parts <e> <s> both parts honour specific commitments that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to complete my speech <e> <s> i shall be glad to return to that point at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i was at pains to say that those dwellings which had the provision of voluntary charitable funds were excluded from the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness give way <e> <s> on that point of the almshouses i will say to her categorically that no conservative government would do that <e> <s> if she is equally satisfied as to what a labour government or a government of any other complexion would do then she should be able to relax <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentions compulsory sale <e> <s> that is not the term to be used in connection with this bill <e> <s> the right to buy is not the same by any means as compulsory sale <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am going to try to do if you will bear with me is to comment on what each and every speaker has said and the points he or she has made <e> <s> it is a somewhat marathon task yes indeed of them but i shall try to do it quickly if i can <e> <s> if i feel i am faltering at a later stage then you will understand why <e> <s> to begin with the noble baroness lady birk and indeed the noble baroness lady fisher at the end made observations about housing generally <e> <s> i hope that one thing they would concede from the start and they both referred and i think someone else did too to waiting lists is that waiting lists are a poor indicator of housing need <e> <s> they are at best an indication <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be delighted to do that <e> <s> i shall make sure that any communication to lord goodman is copied at least to the noble lord lord prys-davies and to the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> i shall go through it most carefully <e> <s> the noble baroness knows that i am always as assiduous as i can be on the point of communication <e> <s> i have always figured that if i tell you everything you cannot say that you did not know <e> <s> i will continue to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords without question i accept what the noble lady has said <e> <s> i think that my hand must have got tired when i was taking my note and i stopped at that key point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness knows perfectly well that i am really not saying that at all <e> <s> i listen very carefully to everything that she says she knows that i always do and i hope that in turn she will do the same when i speak <e> <s> what i have said is that there has been misunderstanding generally and as to the exemptions in particular and i still think that there are misunderstandings although not on everyones part of course not <e> <s> but i still think there are misunderstandings and to make the point i would have to go yet again into details of exactly what the exemptions are <e> <s> but we will come back to this have no fear <e> <s> may i say finally to my noble friend lord bathurst that when he said only people i make to him the same point that i made earlier <e> <s> yes it seems a lot for what it is but the fact is that the principle is a very deep one <e>", "<cs> indeed i will my lords <e> <s> i certainly will write on that and if the noble baroness lady birk wants a copy she shall have one <e> <s> i have nothing more to say <e> <s> clearly there is great concern about clause <e> <s> i think that most of the rest of the bill although there is some anxiety will not in the end present too much difficulty <e> <s> clause really is a matter of much concern <e> <s> we respect that concern and do not lightly turn it down <e> <s> how can we if we want to get it through your lordships house <e> <s> and we do <e> <s> i believe as fervently as anyone who has spoken to the contrary that in trying to do what the right reverend prelate said and give justice to those who need it we have run into the kind of difficulties that have been expressed <e> <s> where we will go from here i do not know but we will take note of all that has been said <e> <s> in the meanwhile i hope that your lordships will feel that the debate has been a good one and that you will give the bill a second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make a brief observation with the leave to the house in response to the noble lord <e> <s> lord howie to whom i am grateful for what he said <e> <s> i am well aware of the time it has taken to have this discussion and my concern is very much that of my noble friend lord nugent <e> <s> it would have been easy to have said why not <e> <s> there is no concern on the governments part about the matter being debated <e> <s> but there are factors here which are far more important than the issue of this one matter at this one time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the business management of the house in the conduct of which the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede is such a distinguished member will decide that before very long and that a statement will be made <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say first of all that i am sorry to hear that the noble baroness lady nicol is ill <e> <s> i hope that she is not very ill and will soon be back <e>", "<cs> my lords those who have spoken for the amendment obviously speak with great conviction and there is merit in much of what they have said <e> <s> i must say at once however that i cannot accept the amendment although i am not unimpressed by what has been said <e> <s> the basic difficulty is that which we have had all along in dealing with the question of appointing people to represent specific interests to as the noble baroness lady white reminded us these small boards which have basically a management function <e>", "<cs> my lords that takes us back to some earlier debates that we had <e> <s> when i said there were obligations i was referring to obligations in a practical and moral sense of wanting to see there was that type of information and that kind of obligation exists <e> <s> additionally there are others <e> <s> i would refer to section of the water act as amended <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord knows that well <e> <s> he will know it better than i <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house may i just say that i really did omit to mention the role that the noble lord lord sherfield and the noble baroness lady white had played in bringing this matter forward in the first instance <e> <s> i recall so well the second reading debate when we were very much on the receiving end of much criticism and in consequent discussions with the noble lord lord sherfield in particular <e> <s> i think that the house would have to concede to him a great part in influencing our thinking as well as to the noble baroness lady fisher my noble friend lord sandford and others <e> <s> in particular i feel that i ought to have said that before <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord lord bishopston need worry too much about the responsibility for this falling upon his shoulders i believe we can safely assume that that will not be the case <e> <s> nevertheless i welcome the observations made both by him and by the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> i will pick up just one or two of the points they made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the comments of the noble lord lord kennet and thank him <e> <s> he asked me will the government compel the oil companies to sell lead-free petrol <e> <s> obviously we are some way from that i am quite confident that once this is agreed as i am sure it will be there will be no need for the government to compel them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord will enjoy reading that in <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord cledwyn for that observation and have no <e>", "<cs> as we shall see when we come to clause if the land is owned by a charity and was acquired by that charity with its own funds then that will exclude them from the right to buy <e> <s> to be able to answer my noble friend one would need to know the circumstances of the particular dwellings to which she refers <e>", "<cs> first of all we are talking here not specifically of local authority housing as such so it really does not apply <e> <s> on the other hand i entirely take the point the noble lord makes that these are complex technical matters <e> <s> i could have moved the amendments by saying less about them but i think it <e>", "<cs> i understand the point that my noble friend makes but the actual amount that the original head lease owner will obtain is surely a matter for negotiation when the time applies <e> <s> i would not have thought that the legislation now being proposed would in any way disadvantage him <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend would like to take this up with me and discuss it in more detail <e> <s> i shall be glad to arrange for him to do so but i think that his concern need not be as bad as he thinks <e>", "<cs> i should not like to speculate on the number of dwellings affected although i agree with the noble lord lord evans of claughton that it is likely to be small <e> <s> nevertheless if something is right then it is right <e> <s> this is the theme of what we will be discussing <e> <s> may i say to my noble friends who will be speaking on the next amendments and not in any way to preempt what they will say that the government are not without sympathy to the points that they make <e> <s> however i shall reserve my observations on those matters until we come to those amendments <e>", "<cs> again it is very difficult without knowing the specific circumstances in detail to answer but in principle so far as the councils are concerned under the act the tenants have a right to buy <e> <s> if there is the difficulty that my noble friend mentions and she would like me to look at it in detail i shall be happy to do so <e> <s> it is very hard to say specifically and categorically without knowing the details why there is the problem to which she refers when the act is so clear <e> <s> however i shall gladly look into it <e>", "<cs> as i indicated a few moments ago we are not unsympathetic at all to this amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord swinfen has indicated that he has connections with a charitable housing association which has a scheme or schemes where arrangements of the kind that he described exist <e> <s> i think that he might be prepared to agree that they are not common by any means <e> <s> we for our part know of only a few schemes where they operate <e> <s> however i can understand that disabled tenants who are dependent on help from their co-tenants and who might not otherwise be able to manage to live in self-contained accommodation might be concerned at the possibility of the withdrawal of that help <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> that is not so <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said that one of the statements that he made was unchallengeable <e> <s> i know that he will appreciate that i shall want to challenge it later but i should not wish at this stage to enter the clause stand part debate <e> <s> i shall reserve until later what i want to say about that <e> <s> but i assure the noble lord that faced though i am with opposition i nevertheless believe that the governments case is a very powerful one <e> <s> certainly i know that my noble friend of all people will listen to it very carefully and judge it on its merits <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether my noble friend will find my remarks encouraging although i hope he will <e> <s> as he says the purpose of the amendment is that charitable housing associations and housing trusts whose tenants claim the right to buy under clause should have in certain circumstances a right of appeal to the secretary of state <e> <s> the right of <e>", "<cs> my noble friends objective in bringing forward this amendment is to absolve the trustees of charitable housing associations and housing trusts of the need to try to obtain possession of dwellings let to secure tenants who were not in necessitous circumstances and whose continued occupation of the dwelling might therefore be held to be in conflict with the objects of the charity <e> <s> the amendment deems that such dwellings should be held as an investment by the charity rather than as part of its operational land for so long as the tenant remains in occupation and is not in necessitous circumstances <e> <s> my noble friend has based the amendment on some advice given some years ago by the charity commission to the national federation of housing associations <e> <s> i think that it is open to doubt whether an amendment of this kind would in fact achieve my noble friends objective <e> <s> however i will confine my remarks to the issue of principle raised by the amendment which is i am afraid not acceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> let me say at once that i am under no illusions as to the degree of your lordships concern to ensure that charitable housing associations can continue to carry out their long-standing and immensely valuable role <e> <s> let me therefore state right at the outset that the government attach the greatest importance to the contribution which charitable housing associations have made and will continue to make in the field of housing for rent <e>", "<cs> this is precisely what it is about <e> <s> i listened carefully to all that was said by noble lords opposite <e> <s> i am sure that they will afford me the same courtesy <e> <s> the fact is that this bill is precisely about that <e> <s> in that single phrase the right reverend prelate makes our whole case for us <e>", "<cs> let me just point out that the key word there is replaced <e> <s> but the fact that the noble lord said that in this way rents would be pushed up shows with great respect that he does not understand the point <e> <s> the rents are in no way connected with the cost of the dwelling <e> <s> the rents are fair rents based upon the valuation placed by the rent assessment committee and the rent officer <e> <s> so the rents fixed have nothing to do with it at all and the noble lord must certainly acknowledge that <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment as my noble friend lady lane-fox has explained would be to narrow the range of disabled persons dwellings excluded from the right to buy <e> <s> the existing provision in paragraph of schedule to the act excludes <e>", "<cs> clearly there is a wide gulf between us <e> <s> just as the noble baroness lady birk and the noble lord lord hylton feel that they must resist the amendment i feel just as passionately that it ought to be accepted <e> <s> nobody cares tuppence about the people who occupy these homes <e>", "<cs> noble lords always protest whenever i say this but the fact is that we have been fought every inch of the way <e> <s> the noble baroness will go on fighting every inch of the way against the right to buy <e> <s> the fact is that over half a million people have now exercised their right to buy <e> <s> people have paid rent for up to years and have nothing at all <e> <s> we are suggesting that we should give them the right to buy <e> <s> again the gulf is wider than ever <e>", "<cs> the last thing which the noble baroness should do is to talk about political reasons <e> <s> her political theology is totally against the right to buy all the way down the line <e> <s> we are miles apart on this <e> <s> it is a matter of opinion about helping another batch of people about whom the noble lords and baronesses opposite and the noble lord lord hylton simply do not want to know <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness about one thing that there is not much point in saying any more about it <e>", "<cs> in order to continue exactly the same ratio of per cent <e> <s> per year following on from the to the as goes from the to the at the moment <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble earl says <e>", "<cs> not in the slightest <e> <s> it is quite straightforward <e> <s> the point about the percentage discount has nothing whatever to do with it <e> <s> it is another matter entirely <e> <s> as i said before the purpose and effect of the amendment is to give the secretary of state the power to change the cut-off date to any later date that he may specify without having to change the primary legislation <e> <s> it may be right that the cut-off date should be changed from time to time to reflect the impact of inflation <e> <s> as i said earlier it will save unnecessary work for local authorities in determining cost floors which will not often bite on discounts <e> <s> we are currently considering the arguments for such a change <e>", "<cs> the cost floor date is the date on which the calculation is made as to what is the cost floor <e> <s> clearly i shall be happy to write a detailed explanatory note showing how the calculation is arrived at and anything else that i think would help the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> that if i may say so is a pretty bit of shadow boxing <e> <s> i too have copious notes on the matter <e> <s> it is a question of how far one deals with it now <e> <s> all i would say is that the main effect of the amendment would be to transfer from the secretary of state to the landlord the responsibility for deciding whether to exclude elderly persons dwellings from the right to buy <e> <s> its effect would be to withdraw the right to buy from some tenants who have it already as agreed by parliament <e> <s> in the governments view it would be quite unacceptable to withdraw important and valuable legal rights from those who have them already <e> <s> the fact is that the provision of what is now paragraph of schedule to the act represents a carefully balanced compromise worked out after much debate in both houses in <e>", "<cs> not for the first time <e>", "<cs> clause <e>", "<cs> the position currently is that there is no provision for interest <e> <s> it is an interesting point that my noble friend makes <e> <s> we will certainly think about this <e> <s> i believe the one point my noble friend would concede is that of great moment this matter is not <e> <s> however we shall certainly think about this and i will drop a note to the noble lord lord prys-davies <e>", "<cs> before the house moves onto the amendments perhaps it would be for the convenience of your lordships if i were to say that with regard to clause which was debated at such length on tuesday last the government would like it to be known that they do not intend to replace clause in the bill either in your lordships house or in another place <e> <s> i felt that i should say that at the first opportunity so to do <e>", "<cs> clause implements our proposal and if my noble friend will permit i shall speak also to amendment no <e> <s> to establish the option of a private sector alternative to local authority building control <e> <s> it provides the mechanisms enabling an approved inspector to undertake the functions of inspecting plans and supervising building work <e>", "<cs> i did refer to the fact that there has to be further consultation and that will be so <e> <s> my noble friend will take the point that with regulations these are matters which develop after consultations <e> <s> therefore the likelihood of the regulations being available before the bill goes through the house is remote in the extreme <e> <s> nevertheless i know of my noble friends concern and of his knowledge in this area <e> <s> it will be useful to hear what he has to say <e> <s> if my noble friend has not yet seen them i shall be glad to make available to him the notes on clauses which may serve to give some clarification <e> <s> i certainly offer him the facility of any detailed explanation or clarification that he might like to have on any aspect of the bill <e>", "<cs> it is absolutely if i may use the expression par for the course for the many bills with which i have been associated that regulations are worked out after the bill goes through or while the bill is going through <e> <s> i was rather amused when the noble baroness said that a year ago there were consultations and discussions taking place i thought she was about to chide me for the fact that nothing had been resolved but she went on to ask why the undue haste <e> <s> i am sure she was referring to something slightly different <e> <s> the fact is that this is the normal procedure and the regulations will have to be resolved as we go along by consultations which will continue <e> <s> discussions on the bill always afford an additional opportunity <e> <s> my noble friend lord caithness for example and my noble friend lord swinfen obviously have something they want to put in and this is part of what i understand as consultation which i think is welcomed <e> <s> one wants to have it as right as one can get it <e> <s> so although that may not be too satisfactory to the noble baroness i hope it is at least an explanation of the position as it is <e>", "<cs> no i cannot give that assurance to my noble friend <e> <s> what i can give him an assurance about is that the point he makes will be very well taken and hopefully will be a contribution to the regulations as they will eventually turn out to be <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree with the noble baroness that this is an important matter <e> <s> let me say first that subsections and provide two methods by which the secretary of state will be able to see that satisfactory insurance arrangements are made <e> <s> the objective is to ensure that the building owner and any subsequent owner will be certain to be able to obtain redress at least within a known period where defects were subsequently discovered in a certified building <e> <s> it will always be open to a building owner to sue a certifier for negligence at any time in the future subject to any time limit in the general law of liability but measures taken under these subsections would guarantee redress for a known period <e>", "<cs> absolutely <e> <s> we are very concerned about the inspectors and the insurance aspects which my noble friend mentions <e> <s> to the best of my knowledge that is so in fact it must be so if we are to get the protection and the cover that is required <e>", "<cs> if i might add just one word let me make it quite clear that it is considered that insurance is absolutely essential <e> <s> the bill requires it <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> a final word if i may just to remind my noble friend i am sure he does not need it or to make the position quite clear <e> <s> the developer whoever he may be has an option <e> <s> it is not an either/or situation <e> <s> he has the option to say i want the local authority to do it <e> <s> i like the way that it is now <e> <s> i prefer their system <e> <s> he is absolutely entitled to do that <e> <s> but what the bill gives is an option to those who feel that there is a more flexible and quicker alternative <e> <s> that is all it is doing and not offering one thing instead of another <e> <s> it is not either/or <e>", "<cs> whether this particular point should be written into the bill is a question that i should have to consider though i doubt whether we should want to do so i think that it is self-explanatory <e> <s> but again as with many of the technical querie which my noble friend raises not least in the light of his own very considerable expert knowledge in this sphere i should be glad to take up with him any point which he feels may be necessary and which is not sufficiently clarified <e>", "<cs> we have not yet reached any firm conclusion as to which bodies should be designated <e> <s> this is a matter on which we propose to consult further <e> <s> any application will be considered on its merits <e> <s> they could well include a number of professional institutions and the clause as it stands provides for this <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> with which if your lordships permit i should also like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> a would have the effect that only a single body could be designated by the secretary of state for the purpose of approving inspectors <e> <s> i do not think that the limitation is justified <e> <s> i am not sure that it is even what the noble baroness and the noble lord lord prys-davies intend <e> <s> there are existing bodies that should be quite capable of approving inspectors to undertake certain sorts of work <e> <s> i am thinking particularly of the professional institutions <e> <s> it is my belief that members of some existing professional institutions and registered architects provided that they are sufficiently experienced should be competent to inspect some of the more straightforward types of building and that the respective institutions are sufficiently responsible to approve their members on the basis of their professional experience <e> <s> clause specifically provides for approval of an inspector to be limited to particular kinds of work <e>", "<cs> my noble friend raises important points <e> <s> the question of who judges the competence in the scenario that i have described will be the professional bodies <e> <s> is there not always the safeguard however of an appointed inspector passing on the word to someone else that when appointed he takes on the responsibility <e> <s> what a responsibility it is <e> <s> it is true that he will have insurance but he only has to be proved incompetent once and that if i may use the expression would be game set and match for him <e> <s> there is a tremendous onus on a person appointed to make sure that anyone to whom he may sub-delegate work does that work properly and carries it out <e>", "<cs> let me just confirm to the noble lord that yes indeed the designated body can withdraw approval <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness had that concern and she knew that it was an inspector other than a local authority who was supervising the work then clearly the complaint would go in the first instance to the inspector and she would specify the grounds of her complaint <e> <s> if she was not then satisfied that he acted upon it or if he acted and she was still not satisfied then she would surely go to the body who had appointed him and say so <e> <s> the inspector would be faced with a challenge which he would then know he would have to justify in two ways <e> <s> first if he persisted and if the complainant let the matter go but it proved in the end that there had been negligence or incompetence on his part then he would be very much at risk he would certainly be liable <e> <s> furthermore the designated body faced with the type of complaint to which the noble baroness has referred would surely want to look into it and discuss it with the inspector and give him a chance to have his say before coming to a conclusion <e> <s> that is a fairly logical approach <e> <s> but i should not have thought that the local authority in the circumstances which the noble baroness has described would come into the matter <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be helpful in discussing my noble friends amendment if i briefly explained the intention behind clause and in particular subsection to which the amendment relates <e> <s> clause will enable the secretary of state to approve suitably qualified people to act as inspectors of building control work and to confer this power on bodies which he designates <e> <s> the clause also provides for limitations to be attached to any approval and subsection is intended to ensure that inspectors are only approved to undertake the type of work for which their qualifications and experience fit them if for example an inspector was suitable to certify low-rise housing but not a more complex scheme his approval would have to be limited accordingly <e> <s> clause is therefore concerned with matters of professional qualifications and experience in other words the <e>", "<cs> my noble friend knows that i cannot nor can anyone give a definition of independence <e> <s> it will be a question of common sense and if challenged later then it would be open to a judgment <e> <s> let me repeat what i said before which was pretty categorical <e> <s> we hope to achieve this position by making regulations <e> <s> i agree they are not spelt out yet but this is nothing new at all <e> <s> this is common practice <e> <s> if my noble friend as i said before has an input into the making of them fine that will be very good <e> <s> the regulations will prescribe that as a general rule an initial notice will have to contain a statement that the inspector is independent so far as a particular project is concerned <e> <s> i said that the test is to be that he must not be a member and this may satisfy my noble friend of a firm or partnership responsible in any other capacity for the design or construction of the work <e> <s> i should have thought that that was pretty clear and i hope my noble friend will think so too but he must decide <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend had worked as much with local authorities as i have he would know that the one thing they do not really want is a lot of encouragement of the kind he has just suggested nevertheless i take the point that he makes <e> <s> i do not say that i do not sympathise with it but in practical terms that is not really what this is about <e> <s> on the other point made by my noble friend i can tell him that generally speaking the whole building is the responsibility of the inspector appointed <e> <s> he may indeed subcontract if that is the right word to others to do work but whether he does or does not at the end of the day the responsibility is his <e> <s> the responsibility is upon him and it will be for him to be sure that the standards are maintained <e>", "<cs> i am not too sure about things exploding i am doing my best not to do so myself <e> <s> can i say that acceptance by the local authority of a plan certificate will give the developer similar protection to that resulting from the passing of plans by the local authority under the current system that is in the event of responsibility reverting to the local authority if it can be shown that work has been carried out in accordance with plans which the certifier has approved the local authority will not be able to serve a notice requiring it to be taken down or altered on the ground that it contravenes the regulations <e> <s> the apparent intention of this amendment is to make it obligatory for an approved inspector to give a plan certificate in all cases rather than only where the developer has requested it <e> <s> at the moment the bill would allow an approved inspector who has not been asked to provide a plan certificate to use his discretion as to how far he scrutinised plans before building work began <e>", "<cs> i have nothing to add <e> <s> of course i will discuss with my colleagues as always everything that is said here <e> <s> if they feel that there has been something omitted here along the lines of what my noble friend has said then we shall want to do something about it <e> <s> that is the only helpful comment i can make <e>", "<cs> i cannot give such an assurance <e> <s> i can only repeat what i have said to my noble friend lord caithness <e> <s> together with colleagues and experts we will take careful note of what has been said <e> <s> that i undertake to do <e>", "<cs> i fear that amendment no <e> <s> may have an effect which my noble friend would not desire <e> <s> clause to which the amendment relates provides that an approved inspector shall give a final certificate to the developer and to the local authority when work specified in an initial notice has been satisfactorily completed <e> <s> this certificate can relate to the whole of the work specified in an initial notice or to only part of it <e> <s> for example in the case of a housing development where a single initial notice covered an entire estate a final certificate given under clause could relate to all the houses together or separate notices could be given for each house <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount tempts me sorely would that i could say yes <e> <s> i fear that i shall have some difficulty but as he knows from our previous discussions on other legislation in the past i hope to be not less than helpful <e>", "<cs> very much not <e> <s> i have to say in all fairness that i have a difficulty <e>", "<cs> if i may refer first to amendment no <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the committee that under clause the secretary of state will be able to approve certain public bodies to supervise work which they carry out on their own buildings if they so wish schedule provides the necessary mechanism <e> <s> both amendments will have a similar effect in requiring final certificates whether given by an inspector or a public body to be accompanied by plans of the work as built <e>", "<cs> if i can just answer the noble lord lord prys-davies you would go to exactly the same place as you go now because there is no requirement at the present time for local authorities to get or to retain as-built plans <e> <s> the obligation that the amendment proposes would impose new burdens on local authorities as well as on developers <e>", "<cs> the effect of amendment no <e> <s> would be to add four more subsections to clause of which the first subsection is the main one <e> <s> this would allow a local authority whenever an initial notice ceased to be in force to issue a stop-notice requiring a developer to stop doing any more work on the building in this case for days <e>", "<cs> in order to be eligible for approval as a self-certifier a public body will have to act under enactment for public purposes and not for its own profit <e> <s> the categories from which self-certifying bodies would be chosen could include broadly speaking most statutory undertakers nationalised industries and municipal undertakings <e>", "<cs> clause creates two offences relating to false or misleading statements in initial notices plans certificates and final certificates <e> <s> it will be an offence to give a notice or certificate which the person giving it knows to contain a false or misleading statement <e> <s> it will also be an offence to give a notice or certificate recklessly where it contains a false or misleading statement <e>", "<cs> i would not deem it right to go so far as that because i am not sure of the exact extent of the safeguards that the noble lord wishes <e> <s> but if he likes what i will gladly undertake to do is to go into much more detail with chapter and verse between now and the next stage and in fact i can do it now in order to give him an opportunity to see if there is a degree of safeguard which would satisfy him <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asks if i am not being a little naive <e> <s> first perhaps i should say that one can always hope <e> <s> the glc is subject to the same disciplines including audit scrutiny as are other local authorities <e> <s> we shall be considering what arrangements are necessary but we are not proposing any immediate action <e> <s> irresponsible behaviour by the glc in this or in any other area would only serve to underline the case for abolition <e>", "<cs> my lords the simple answer is that we are not proposing to abolish them <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble baroness says and i too read the same comments in the paper this morning by mr stonefrost <e> <s> i make no comment on that at this stage <e> <s> the case for abolition will surely be debated at much greater length when the white paper comes out and when the legislation comes to your lordships house and to another place <e> <s> but the basic underlying fact is that the size of the authority has become increasingly inappropriate to the limited functions which it performs <e> <s> it no longer has sewerage which has gone to the water authorities <e> <s> it no longer has housing which has gone to the boroughs <e> <s> it no longer has the ambulance service <e> <s> there is no doubt in the governments view that by abolishing it and passing most of its remaining functions to the boroughs we shall secure more economical and effective local government in london <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what my noble friend says and i respect her observations not least because of the specific position she holds with that authority <e> <s> i would only say to her that many lessons about reorganisation have been learnt and we are very sensitive to the points that she makes <e> <s> the problem is that one has to safeguard the staff who will be transferring and at the same time one has to make quite sure as she has said that we do not finish up at the end of the day with something which will not in fact be more efficient and less costly <e> <s> i am confident that we shall do this <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i hear what the noble lord says and it leaves me as it usually does completely unimpressed <e> <s> the fact is that there is the situation which now pertains with the glc <e> <s> the historical aspects of it interest me not unduly except in so far as they are a guide to us as to what we must beware of falling into in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords we are cognisant of this kind of thing happening <e> <s> we hope that it will not happen but one has to choose ones words carefully in saying more at this stage than that we are alert to that possibility <e> <s> i hope that it will not come about <e> <s> as i said in my opening answer we are entitled to expect that there will be a responsible attitude at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has phrased his question in such a way that it is really moving away from the original question to take in a much wider subject <e> <s> the fact is that it is not a question at all of offending <e> <s> on more than one occasion during the previous parliament i was asked what would be the basis for deciding whether or not there should be abolition <e> <s> i have said more than once as the record will show if the noble lord looks at it although i suspect that he remembers it that the criterion at the end of the day must be whether or not it is an efficiently run authority <e> <s> it is not a question of who controls it or what antics they get up to and believe me they do get up to some antics but i shall not expand on that today although i would dearly love to do so <e> <s> the fact is that the criteria are the ones which i suspect most of your lordships know and on another occasion i shall be glad to expand on that matter too <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful as always to my noble friend for those helpful remarks <e> <s> yes we do note what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords i always give weight to what alan greengross says <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am aware of the concern to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> but it has always been recognised that the government have a legitimate interest in the level of local government spending as a whole <e> <s> furthermore in many areas ratepayers are a relatively small minority of those eligible to vote in local authority elections <e> <s> indeed business ratepayers as such have no vote at all <e> <s> so our proposals for rate reform will include steps to improve the accountability of local authorities to those who shoulder the burden <e>", "<cs> my lords one could have a long debate and give many instances that are a matter for concern but i do not think in answering the original question that i would wish you to do so today <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have come to the conclusion that the proposed legislation is not merely desirable it is absolutely essential <e> <s> on the issue of discussions and consultations i confirm that we intend to have the broadest and most detailed consultation perhaps more than ever before on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for those observations with which i concur entirely <e> <s> it is some of the situations that he has described that have inevitably led the government to their proposed course <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be more impressed by the noble lords concern for the independence of local government if i heard him speaking out about the many anti-democratic actions and abuses of basic local government freedoms that are taking place at the present time <e> <s> it has to be said that it is irresponsible actions and the seeming inability of local government as a whole to do anything to curb them which have made it inevitable that the government must act to protect ratepayers and their own macro-economic policies <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend highlights one of the many steps taken by local government which in the past would never have been considered as having anything to do with local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that such a method would have any more beneficial effect in this country than it has when it pertains in other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i said when answering the original question that one of the shortcomings is the fact that the number of people eligible to vote often does not bear relationship to those who in fact are paying the rates <e> <s> everyone would vote for everything if they did not have to pay anything towards it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sympathetic to the point that my noble friend raises <e> <s> however i think that the facts when carefully analysed would show that the situation is not as she has said <e> <s> there is always a difficult situation when one comes to distribute grant and decide on levels of penalties should those be necessary <e> <s> i shall certainly bear in mind anything that anyone says that will make the proposed legislation better and as good as it can be <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult to answer the last part of what the noble lord said because i could not hear it <e> <s> however i think i understand the gist of what he was saying <e> <s> i repeat what i said originally that i know the concern to which he refers <e> <s> we will take that into account as we come to the very broad consultations which we intend to have <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i did not follow the question too well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baronesses and noble lords who have spoken on the bill <e> <s> indeed i am gratified not an experience that i always have to have noted the generally satisfactory reception which this bill seems to have received <e> <s> i am certainly grateful for that <e> <s> if your lordships will bear with me i should like to deal with the points slightly back to front <e> <s> they will flow well enough if i respond first to the observations made by the noble lord lord kilmarnock because his was the only note of major dissension as to any aspect of the bill <e> <s> also i think it is quite proper that i should comment upon the point that my honourable friend made in another place <e>", "<cs> almost my lords <e> <s> i just want to respond specifically to the point about my noble friend <e> <s> when the bill was being considered in another place the then honourable member for islington south put forward a proposal which would require ministerial approval to expenditure authorised by the bill in order to try to prevent the possible abuse of section by some councils which i say again gave rise to so much justifiable concern <e> <s> my honourable friend undertook to consider whether it would be possible to introduce such a requirement into this bill <e> <s> we considered this carefully as one possible way of dealing with the problem but we did not feel able to incorporate the change into the bill now before your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that <e> <s> she gathers from what i have already said that it is not our intention to introduce anything of the kind into this bill <e> <s> but i hope that she agrees with me and indeed with the other concern expressed <e> <s> there is a problem here and we cannot turn our backs on it and pretend that it does not exist simply because it applies to a relatively small number of people <e> <s> i am glad that it is only a small number but there is some evidence that it applies to a growing number of people <e> <s> perhaps we may leave it at that for today but i am sure that none of us is turning our back on that aspect <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kilmarnock made a very good forecast of what he expected me to say because i am going to say exactly what he anticipated although i believe that i should explain why <e> <s> before doing so i must say to the noble lord lord spens that as he knows a p rate would place million in the hands of the glc and million under section is already a lot of money <e>", "<cs> i recognise absolutely the great depth of feeling with which the noble lord lord harris of greenwich spoke <e> <s> one has to respect that <e> <s> it is a great bitterness that is felt by many people <e> <s> first i am sure that the noble lord will be pleased to know with reference to the article in the <e>", "<cs> so far as this bill is concerned i think that the noble lord knows that we would not be willing or able <e>", "<cs> we are talking here about scope <e> <s> the noble lord will not draw me on that <e> <s> the fact very simply is that we are talking about these amendments <e> <s> i said that if there are any other amendments on similar lines the same thing will apply and that is really where i stand <e>", "<cs> i really must ask the noble lord to withdraw that <e> <s> it is not what i said <e> <s> it is not what i intended and it is wrong of him to say that i did <e>", "<cs> i cannot keep getting up to repeat the same thing again and again <e> <s> i think that what i have said was clear enough <e> <s> i look around me and it seems that most of your lordships appear to think that it was so <e> <s> i do not think that i should expand on it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris said he hoped we would have a harmonious and agreeable meeting <e> <s> he makes it harder for me to have a meeting that will be harmonious and agreeable by the way he always goes on at me <e> <s> nevertheless as he well knows i shall do my best with him when the time comes <e>", "<cs> i cannot comment on that <e> <s> i do not know <e> <s> i hear what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave of the house first may i answer my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and say that perhaps what i said was irrelevant to the amendment but it was certainly very relevant to urban development grants as a whole which is really what we are discussing today <e> <s> i am sure he would welcome the statement i made as to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to commend to him the <e>", "<cs> my lords yet again by leave of the house the fact is that as the noble lord pointed out the advice on this matter to the local authority by their solicitor is that with this bill they would not be acting <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> i should like to say very quickly a thank you to those who have taken part in the discussions on this short bill <e> <s> i am sorry it was all done at such relatively short notice but the need was for that as has been expressed so often <e> <s> it is a good thing that we have aired this matter at some length <e> <s> i hope that good <e>", "<cs> my lords first i thank your lordships who have contributed to this discussion and i certainly thank the noble lord lord bruce for his detailed observations <e> <s> i thank him very much for having been in communication beforehand <e> <s> it is always most helpful when that happens because it enables one to give a more detailed reply at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always difficult when answering questions on statements to write down everything that everyone says <e> <s> i shall do my best to cover those points <e> <s> i hope that if i miss anything your lordships will bear with me <e> <s> i shall of course be in touch <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will contain himself a little i shall come to that and much more in due course <e> <s> between april and april domestic rates rose by per cent <e> <s> compared with a per cent <e> <s> increase in the retail price index <e> <s> the average increase in domestic rates was p in the pound with a range from p to a staggering p <e> <s> against this background of rising expenditure rising rates and now the threat of rising levels of manpower the governments concern is easy to understand <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey i wonder whether the noble baroness will allow me to deal with that point in the later part of the debate <e> <s> i promise her that i shall do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness with respect was not listening when i referred to these points about savings <e> <s> i specifically made the very point that although there must be some consideration of these matters to try to respond in detail at a period when one is going into consultation and discussion is wrong <e> <s> i will not reply in detail but i will return to that point when i speak again later <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may put this to the noble baroness <e> <s> she said that local authorities will not be notified of their grants before december <e> <s> would she tell me when have they ever been notified of their grants before december <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord says indirectly elected i presume he means that the membership will be of elected members of the local authorities concerned appointed by those authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would just allow me to intervene would he then explain why it was that when the rate support grant was reduced under a labour administration from per cent <e> <s> down to per cent <e> <s> local government as a whole did not increase its rates in the way that he says it would have been compelled to do <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness would allow me to say there is nothing new about that <e>", "<cs> in leeds as well my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will permit can he point out what percentage of that local government figure was capital spending and what was revenue <e>", "<cs> one man one vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i am faced with a great dilemma <e> <s> how after some six and three-quarter hours and speeches can i really respond as i would dearly like to do to all the points that have been made <e> <s> i can only say that i ask forgiveness from the beginning if i do not take on this impossible task <e> <s> i will certainly try to cover much of what has been said and certainly the major points but to do anything else unless my noble friend lord denham will give me permission to speak for not less than one hour and preferably for two hours is an impossible task <e> <s> and of course my noble friend lord beloff has yet to come <e>", "<cs> i have just started <e>", "<cs> my lords i would expect the noble baroness to say that and let me say straight away so far as the noble baroness lady fisher is concerned that i absolutely welcome her support for our intentions to abolish the metropolitan counties <e> <s> she made that point categorically clear <e> <s> i welcome it and i would have said many more nice things about her had she been here but she did drop me a note to explain why she could not stay on <e> <s> nevertheless the point about rates is absolutely valid <e> <s> the fact is that it is not fair to pretend that it just does not matter and it is not important <e> <s> it does matter and it is important and those who pay will confirm that very easily <e> <s> even more do those who would like to say otherwise seriously believe that higher rate increases do not feed into the retail price index or do not feed inflation or do not put up industrys costs and destroy jobs <e> <s> all i can say is come back to the real world and talk to those who are on the receiving end of the imposition of rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very glad to write to the noble lord and give him information about that <e> <s> but when they try to compare i shall have to ask <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is too kind <e> <s> quite seriously my lords a joint board does not need to have a big bureaucracy and does not need a lot of premises <e> <s> it can be made to work effectively and smoothly <e> <s> i will talk privately with the noble lord and tell him a little more and hope that i can persuade him that there are some joint boards which can be really effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i have every sympathy with my noble friends question <e> <s> the situation does point to the urgency of the need for some restriction on that minority i stress the word minority of high spending high rating authorities who treat their ratepayers as if money was no object <e> <s> i think that what the government are proposing is the only answer we have except in the case of the glc as my noble friend knows and the government intend to abolish it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know if the list is one the glc has submitted to the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> if it is i would say they would say that wouldnt they <e> <s> if we were concerned about the glcs knowledge of what it will or will not spend we should recognise that the auditors are now producing at least we hope they will produce the figures <e> <s> for the year in question they spent million less than they rated for <e> <s> that is something about which i as one who pays rates to the glc am very concerned indeed to know why i have been called upon to pay a precept for spending that has not been spent <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the auditors to confirm these figures are so <e> <s> i am telling your lordships what the glc say <e> <s> i should have thought in view of other things they say that we should wait to see whether the auditors verify it <e> <s> if they do say that this is so and million is repaid i presume they will not hesitate to give the money back to the people who paid it in the first place and who should not have done so <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the last point i should have thought that the last thing that the noble lord would have wished to pursue was the attempt further to centralise a local authority service <e> <s> that is certainly not the intention of the government nor will we pursue it <e> <s> as to the point about grass cutting i can think of few better illustrations of the virtues of contracting out a term i prefer to use rather than one used by the noble lord than the fact that if the contract does not work satisfactorily the authority has the power and the right to terminate the arrangement <e> <s> it had no such possibility in the circumstances that pertained prior to this <e> <s> as to the number of complaints referred to by the noble lord my information is quite the opposite <e> <s> my information is that the complaints bear no relation to the complaints that were made before the service was carried out in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what line the noble lord is taking but if it is the drawing of the comparison between the merits of service provision by the private as opposed to the public sector i really feel that is irrelevant to the matter at issue <e> <s> what really matters is how the service can best be provided <e> <s> it is the wish of government that all i repeat all local authorities should look at all the alternatives and not take one of them as opposed to another one without investigating very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i have yet to know in my slight experience of local government of a single instance and if there is one the noble lord will surely bring it to my attention where the situation he describes has ever happened <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that the reason for the authority refusing a tender was because it was the lowest <e> <s> i should need an awful lot of information about that before i was convinced <e>", "<cs> my lords i said in the answer a moment ago that million of the million was applicable to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords the urban development grants scheme to which i presume my noble friend refers is proving a very great success <e> <s> indeed only today i am announcing a further three schemes being approved in wolverhampton coventry and nottingham and the overall total in this respect now amounts to over million of which only slightly over million comes from the public sector <e> <s> the remainder comes from the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly i cannot say what the amount of next years urban programme funds will be but i think i can assuage the concern of the noble baroness if she is relying upon a particular newspaper report <e> <s> i gladly tell her that that report like a number of others very recently is in some kind of phantasy land <e>", "<cs> my lords the urban programme funds can be applied to purposes of the kind to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> however there are other sources for that kind of restoration <e> <s> but certainly when we receive applications for that purpose within a particular urban programme we look at them very carefully and of course are sympathetic to them <e>", "<cs> my lords improvement grants as such do not form part of the urban programme that is a separate matter entirely <e> <s> i think the noble baroness is referring to general improvement grants which were per cent <e> <s> with an increase to per cent <e> <s> for a time and where the indication is that they will again come back to per cent <e> <s> that really is not part of the urban programme <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i wish to repeat a statement made in another place by my honourable friend the minister for housing and construction <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness lady birk and the noble lord lord beaumont for what i think were their helpful and constructive comments <e> <s> i should like to try and pick up the points that they made <e> <s> the noble baroness was concerned about houses built after who knows what the future will bring as to that <e> <s> but the report in <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i cannot comment on what took place at the last council meeting <e> <s> the duty to re-acquire will apply where the repair is unlikely to give a mortgageable product <e> <s> that is essentially what the statement is saying <e> <s> it may well be that this will have to be brought out in discussions with the associations when we sit down and talk about it with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his observations with which in many ways i agree <e> <s> i personally was on the receiving end of similar situations but i must hasten to add that it was post- though only just <e> <s> when we begin to look at where the responsibility lies and to question who should put up the resources we venture into very sticky territory <e> <s> certainly central government have a part to play for the reasons that i know and local authorities also have a role in this whole matter <e> <s> it would be wrong to say other than that were so <e> <s> but it probably does not help us today to press on with this matter other than to take up the point which the noble lord was making about how much central government should pay <e> <s> that will have to come out in the discussions that will take place <e> <s> i cannot help the noble lord by expanding on the matter further at present as i am sure he will appreciate <e> <s> the point he makes is fundamentally valid <e> <s> however there is another aspect to it which will have to be weighed in the balance at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite clear about the additional statistics my noble friend requires when she says that i did not give her the answer she expected or required on the figures between and <e> <s> the figures i gave are the figures which are the facts <e> <s> as to the second point the per cent <e> <s> increase in the rate precept over the last two years by the glc is quite enormous and compares with a per cent <e> <s> average across the rest of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of government grant is really a matter for the glc themselves <e> <s> they can be within or without grant according to the levels of expenditure they decide to incur <e> <s> the reason they are out of grant at the present time is because their expenditure is some million over the target set <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has put a whole series of questions <e> <s> first of all the statistics the noble lord gives regarding government expenditure are not correct <e> <s> if one tries to draw a proper comparison one should look at things like expenditure on defence the health service social security and so on which are really matters which are <e>", "<cs> my lords i do indeed confirm what my noble friend says <e> <s> those who would try to pretend that this is not a significant factor in what is happening in employment within the areas concerned are really misleading themselves and others <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly write in detail to the noble lord giving him a list of the figures for each year <e> <s> i hope that will be helpful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that i think the noble viscount would like me to give are not those that i would readily bring to answer a question such as that on the order paper but i shall certainly be glad to write to the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly confirm the first point made by my noble friend <e> <s> i mentioned a figure of per cent <e> <s> as the increase in precept over the past two years <e> <s> i am aware that the figure under the previous conservative administration was much less <e> <s> but again when referring to the specific amounts of grant lost each year one must qualify the word lost because it is lost if there is a penalty and that has happened with the glc because of its massive over-spending <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not expect me to agree with his assessment of the reasons for loss of grant <e> <s> the fact is that there is a basis of assessment of need which applies throughout the whole country to everyone <e> <s> it is a method which is clearly there for everyone to question in detail if they so wish <e> <s> grants are then given on that basis <e> <s> the government believe that it is critical to contain the per cent <e> <s> of total public expenditure which represents local government expenditure in the context of managing the economy <e> <s> that is why the government have set down systems to try in the first place to exhort or otherwise penalise those authorities who will not do what local authorities have always done in the past that is to work within parameters set down by central government <e> <s> it is the failure to do that which is causing the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords who have spoken on this subject <e> <s> i certainly appreciate the concern <e> <s> indeed i welcome the chance to amplify some of the things which were said over the weekend <e> <s> the one thing that we do not want is any secrecy or anything of that kind <e> <s> that is the one thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his observations within his question <e> <s> certainly it is not within the honourable traditions that is about the last thing that it is but it has to be said that the auditor has to adjudicate in each case on every issue if you like that is brought to him and i hope that he will look very carefully at the most recent one <e>", "<cs> my lords the act is quite clear it is open to ratepayers to question each and every issue <e> <s> the conclusion that the auditor may have reached on earlier issues would clearly seem to indicate that no action was to be taken by him otherwise we should have heard of it <e> <s> i think it is equally fair to say however that the degree of politicisation in the most current issues of not just this publication but others by other authorities is becoming more and more extreme and it is therefore again for the auditor if called upon by the ratepayers to adjudicate in each case <e> <s> that is the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware and indeed the noble lord is quite right that there are a number of authorities which go well beyond the point which the noble lord lord graham made earlier <e> <s> i think that he would probably be the first to agree with me if we sat down together and looked at them that there is always a balance of what is fair and sensible and reasonable in presenting ones own case as to what one is doing as an authority <e> <s> not only is there no objection to that the government feel it is desirable <e> <s> there is a point and that point is being reached again and again <e> <s> as to what the government do about it they have to watch carefully and decide <e> <s> these are not issues which can lightly or easily be acted upon <e> <s> there are great principles at stake here and we have to be very careful about them <e>", "<cs> my lords the conclusion i draw from what my noble friend says is that i am wondering in what category they place me because i receive it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord does not expect me to reiterate the whole story of <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what my noble friend says and i have to concur with him on one thing that the degree of concern about this is rising very much indeed as matters become more and more extreme <e> <s> i can today do no more than say that i note carefully what is said and the feelings in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the observations i made apply to all authorities they would have no credence if they did not do so and i am not here to attack or defend any authority on its own <e> <s> it is the principle that we are all concerned with and if that goes then there is much more loss than we are discussing today <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only hear and sympathise with what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all your lordships will deplore that type of publication using that type of propaganda <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very wide of the question <e> <s> i do not feel obliged to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may respond to the comments which were made by the noble baronesses it seems to be my fate always to be having to respond to the ladies in the house far more difficult a task than had it been the other way round <e> <s> first of all the noble baroness lady birk referred to the comparable figures for government overspending as she put it <e> <s> we always get this when it runs round year after year <e> <s> the fact is that you cannot compare apples with pears <e> <s> local authorities do not have social security and other such demand-led expenditure with which to deal and they do not have to deal with defence although many of them seem to be running their own nuclear programmes and so on <e> <s> but that really is not the same thing <e>", "<cs> my lords if i can try the second half first off the top of my head it goes something like this <e> <s> in at the time of the reorganisation and if i get any of these figures wrong the noble lord will make allowances but i think i have them in my mind capital spending taking a level figure of never mind what for the moment had become by and by last year that figure had become <e> <s> in the current year it is expected to be some and i think if nothing else that gives an <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness knows that the priorities for spending are always for the authority itself to decide <e> <s> but i would say that if i were in the position of an authority which was having its grant cut for whichever reason the first thing i would do is look at what it costs to provide the services <e> <s> the fact is that those authorities which concern the noble baroness so much as i well know happen to be authorities which in many instances are not willing to look at the cost of provision <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raises a very interesting point on exactly the opposite side of the fence <e> <s> he highlights the problem of having to take a finite sum of money and distribute it on the principle of equalisation and yet having to take care of the very important point that he makes although as he will have heard in another place and again here today concern has been expressed in the opposite direction <e> <s> i know the position because i went to warwickshire and spent two hours talking to the members of the council about their particular situation <e> <s> it is very true that they have tried very hard to work within the parameters and in many ways they have been successful <e> <s> their concern is where do they go from here <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not recall having made a separate statement for wales before in the past when this matter has arisen <e> <s> but may i ask whether the noble lord will allow me to come back to him on this which i gladly undertake to do <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the reason why i did not take up my noble friends question before was that i was trying to cover the points raised by the front benches <e> <s> in fact of the million overspend the figure for the glc is round about million <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to continue i am able to say to the noble lord lord prys-davies that i am informed that a statement on wales will he made in another place very shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the reference to statements being made in cash terms and the necessity for them to be made in real terms i will certainly discuss with my right honourable friend the point which the noble lord has made <e> <s> but i remind the noble lord of two things <e> <s> first i am repeating a statement that is being made in another place by my right honourable friend <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord did not mean to imply that i was trying to mislead the house as such <e> <s> what he meant i think and if he does not agree i am sure he will say so was that by presenting it only in cash terms it is itself not clear <e> <s> but i personally dislike the word mislead very much indeed <e> <s> it implies something which is not the case and i hope that the noble lord will accept that from me <e>", "<cs> my lords i had noticed that but in fact the signatories to the document clearly do not share the governments view of the need to contain public expenditure within what the country can afford <e> <s> but we have that view and we were elected on the basis of it <e> <s> as to the other references to the abolition and so on clearly the noble lord and those who put their names to this paper have a totally different view from that of the government and certainly from mine <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no intention to dismantle big city government <e>", "<cs> my lords there are those who might fairly question that certainly by reading the conclusions which the signatories to this paper reach <e> <s> but far be it from me at question time to attempt such a definition <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness pleads in aid the cause and the writings of the academics <e> <s> i prefer to plead in aid the needs of the people who pay the bills at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> i pronounce it sowse my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to repeat something i said a moment ago that the one group of people who do not reject wholesale the governments proposals are the mass of people throughout the country businesses and individuals who have to pay the bills at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness makes her own judgments as to what the proposals mean <e> <s> i would only say that the criticisms in this particular report or paper are based largely on value judgments which at the end of the day are clearly political in character <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly i am not privy to the discussions on the serpell report and i am sorry to have to say that that is so <e> <s> but i will gladly undertake to write in detail with a copy to the noble lord lord cledwyn everything i can possibly obtain by way of information on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords when winding up a debate that has lasted for several hours the problem is always how to cover everything that everyone has said <e> <s> if one does not cover everything there is always the concern that one has done less than justice to speakers who have really thought carefully about what they have said <e> <s> i can only ask noble lords to bear with me as they always do and i shall do the best that i can <e> <s> if i do not deal with all the points tonight i shall certainly go through the speeches and try to respond in writing to those matters that require reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not tell the noble baroness what she should say in her speech and she must not tell me what i should say <e> <s> i did not seek to prescribe the parameters within which she should make her references to housing and i would say to her please do not tell me what i should say <e> <s> i would point out that it was the noble baroness who very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i make no comment as to that except to mention as i have said that i am not without some experience of housing including housing for the elderly <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will contain herself i shall come to that point when i refer to the remarks of the noble lord lord hylton <e> <s> i shall be specific <e>", "<cs> my lords the opposition talk about them being chopped <e> <s> they tell me about these cuts that have resulted in an increase in real terms in expenditure of per cent <e> <s> they talk about that as a cut <e> <s> it is only a cut beyond what they would have liked spending to be <e> <s> it is not a cut in real facts and figures <e> <s> the figure for improvement grants is expected to be from about million to million in <e> <s> the noble baroness talks about records <e> <s> i could give her a long list of other things that make records <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand that <e> <s> the noble baroness made many useful points which i shall consider carefully and respond to her <e> <s> the noble baroness said that the bill would help better-off members of the community <e> <s> i do not know what is the definition of a better-off member of the community <e> <s> if it is someone living in a charitable housing association dwelling it would not come within my definition but i am willing to hear the arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords i think on this occasion that it is about even <e> <s> my noble friend said that he liked quite a lot of what we proposed <e> <s> he asked can you maintain a house if you buy it especially where there is shared ownership <e> <s> i can only say that the record so far is pretty good <e> <s> if you asked the people who have bought their own homes and who previously were tenants you may find an odd situation but in the main it is not so <e> <s> my noble friend made the point specifically about shared ownership <e> <s> i hope that i am right in saying that about people so far have bought on that basis <e> <s> i am confident and in fact i venture to suggest that that form of house purchase will become a major factor in the buying of houses in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble baroness felt that that was the way in which to respond to what i had just said <e> <s> i have spent most of my life in the kind of surroundings to which the noble baroness refers and with the greatest respect to her and she knows that i have respect for her in a very big way i do not need any lessons from her as to what people need and the extent to which one has to care for them <e> <s> i take no lessons at all on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am being very good in giving way <e> <s> i have been going for minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing will ever convince me that every one of those people to whom the noble baroness refers is living on supplementary benefit <e> <s> but the noble baroness very nicely brings me to the next point when she asks whether i know that per cent <e> <s> of the people in public housing are receiving benefits <e> <s> yes but that means that per cent <e> <s> are not receiving benefits and if per cent <e> <s> are not receiving benefits we are beginning to talk of great numbers of people hundreds of thousands of people and no one can tell me that three or four out of those thousands really comprise a case at all because they do not <e>", "<cs> hold it my lords <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord lord hylton that in settling the figure for the housing corporations adps for which provides for a gross programme of million we have taken fully into account the resources that will be required for this scheme <e> <s> we shall also take this into account when setting the programme for future years <e> <s> that is the position <e> <s> it is a fact and there it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure you will <e> <s> the noble lord lord hylton also made a very fair plea for consultation about major repairs to old peoples homes between the housing corporations the dhss and the doe <e> <s> the present position is that expenditure on sheltered housing schemes and on caring services stems from the separate statutory responsibilities of housing authorities <e> <s> a major restructuring of the existing machinery at every level would actually be required if some kind of omnibus financial support were to be attempted <e> <s> if it is to that that the noble lord alludes then i do not think it will happen <e> <s> but if he is concerned to ensure greater collaboration and joint working in joint-purpose schemes where caring and housing combine then i think i would go along with him and i shall gladly do whatever i can to try to influence that <e> <s> however perhaps it is something that we should take up outside todays debate and i shall be glad to pursue it with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to confirm that notes on clauses are available now at least i think they are <e> <s> if they are not they will be made available without delay <e> <s> as to the amendment i shall try to ensure that it goes down in plenty of time for consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is understood generally that it is the central thrust of government policy that we do everything we can to see that interest rates are brought down <e> <s> unfortunately as the noble lord in particular will know better than most the factors are not always wholly within our control <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing in either report that makes the white paper statements misleading <e> <s> the fact is that both the reports including the second one to which the noble lord refers prove what the government have said all along that no detailed analysis can be carried out at this stage because as they themselves say they do not know what decisions the boroughs and districts which will take over the services will make as to how they will deal with the services <e> <s> the government remain absolutely confident that the removal of a whole tier of local government will give rise to savings <e>", "<cs> my lords where responsibility for a service including a scheme for concessionary fares passes to the district or borough councils after abolition of the metropolitan county councils and the glc they will normally exercise the same powers and be under the same duties as the mccs and the glc <e> <s> the secretary of state for transport has announced that he would make provision in the london regional transport bill to safeguard the future of a uniform scheme of travel concessions for pensioners and disabled people in london <e> <s> there would be a different situation in the metropolitan county areas following abolition where there would be joint board transport authorities which could take over responsibility for these functions while in london the secretary of state will have responsibility for lrt <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to remind the noble lord that five out of seven authorities concerned were of course conservative-controlled on a previous occasion and the politics of those authorities has nothing whatever to do with the intentions of the bill <e> <s> of course the noble lord will not expect me to agree with him on his assertions <e> <s> i am sure it was a slip of the tongue but the noble lord referred to borough councils and not to county councils <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble baroness is aware consumer services are one of the concurrent functions <e> <s> indeed many think that the fact that there were concurrent functions has itself contributed to authorities of this kind not having been successful <e> <s> of course districts which will receive back this function on its own whereas at the moment they still have that responsibility as do the counties will be responsible <e> <s> i see no reason why we should assume that at the lowest level truly the local level they will be any less responsible than those who at present have a broader canvas <e>", "<cs> my lords on my reading of the report not only does it not make that clear at all but the very fact that even by their analysis they show opportunities for some savings only confirms what we have said all along that there will be opportunities for very much greater savings <e> <s> indeed reports now coming in justify that claim <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he says <e> <s> of course that is one of the objects of the exercise but it is not the only one <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely why we intend to show that this time it can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords need i remind the noble lord that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment issued a press release and comment on this almost immediately it was published <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any difference at all between what my right honourable friend in another place says and what i have said today <e> <s> indeed i consulted with him before i answered the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say to the noble lord that clearly we do not agree with what he says <e> <s> i do not think that quoting the glc and some of its antics this past few years is a good example to give <e> <s> i made the point a few moments ago that the abolition of them and i have made this point many times in the past is not based upon their antics <e> <s> it is based on the fundamental underlying fact that they provide only per cent <e> <s> of all the services in the whole of the area per cent <e> <s> come from other bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes many assertions but i understand his concerns <e> <s> they are shared by everyone who has concern for local government as indeed i have myself as i think the noble lord will confirm <e> <s> the resources and the funds which go to an authority like the glc will properly go to the other authorities who will take over from them <e> <s> the only difference will be that in that one presumes that they will not be in default and therefore lose such grants they will have more to spend than the glc has without going to the ratepayer <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point that there is much that has yet to be spelt out in greater detail and indeed which will be <e> <s> i hope that that will go some way to assuaging his concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords i said earlier that at the present time the seven authorities concerned are labour-controlled <e> <s> at the last time five of them were conservative-controlled <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to comment on the noble lords assessment of what is light <e>", "<cs> may i first say to my noble friend lord molson that work is at present taking place on consolidation of the housing acts and we fully take his point on this <e> <s> i should be very glad at any time to hear any suggestion which my noble friend may have as far as that work is concerned i hope he will be pleased to know that it is taking place at the present time <e>", "<cs> i hope i am not taking hostile positions in this early stage of our proceedings <e> <s> may i say how pleased i am to see the noble lord lord evans of claughton in his place <e> <s> may i remind the noble baroness lady nicol she who waxes so indignant about the act and its contents that it was a lahour government which brought in that legislation <e> <s> indeed i would go further and remind her that the very attempt that was made by the conservative opposition at that time to bring in exactly the kind of clause now proposed was passed in your lordships house and reversed by her government in another place where it was taken out again <e> <s> so i think we should make it quite clear as to who is supporting whom and when <e>", "<cs> i was well aware when i made the comment i did that that might be a riposte but the fact is that just as the then labour government felt it was wrong at that time so the present government feel it is wrong now <e> <s> having said that i want also to say that i am not without sympathy for the points made and that as in so many matters of this kind it is not always a question of right and wrong or black and white <e> <s> there are situations which i acknowledge are a cause of concern to my noble friends in particular and i do not seek to deny that <e> <s> my noble friend lord molson said that the cambridge situation quoted was concerned with flats but that it might just as well have been houses and in that case what would the position have been <e> <s> i accept that as a very fair point <e> <s> i hope that he and the committee will in turn accept that the great majority of these developments do concern flats rather than houses <e>", "<cs> the amendment to clause which was tabled by my noble friend lord coleraine would as he said allow tenants to buy a sub-lease of both fiats and houses in all cases where the landlords own lease has more than years to run <e> <s> clause as drafted provides that in the case of flats the minimum term must be years <e> <s> perhaps i may explain why we have decided on this different treatment of houses and flats <e>", "<cs> on a point of clarification what i actually said and i can well sympathise with my noble friend for not following what is a complex matter was that years is the minimum unexpired term and we are talking here of leasehold normally acceptable to private sector mortgagees as security for the purchase of residential property <e>", "<cs> i was of course referring to residential property <e> <s> if the noble lord is saying that what he has said is so in the case of residential property in the west end of london then i certainly would not quarrel with him <e> <s> but what i have stated is the generally accepted rule as i understand it <e>", "<cs> before commenting on the detailed points which my noble friend has made i should like to put this subsection of clause into its wider context <e> <s> it is part of a package of proposals in clauses and of the bill designed with two objects <e> <s> the first is to bring certain county council tenancies within the scope of the security of tenure and right to buy provisions of the act <e> <s> the second is to supplement and refine the categories of dwellings which are excluded from security of tenure and/or the right to buy for certain operational reasons <e> <s> these two objectives are related <e> <s> in extending security of tenure and the right to buy to county council tenancies we clearly need to ensure that counties operational responsibilities are not prejudiced <e>", "<cs> what i said on amendment no <e> <s> i should like to say again to my noble friend <e> <s> i think that this is part of what i understood we undertook to look at carefully and hopefully bring back at report in a manner which she will think covers the points she makes <e> <s> i gladly undertake to do with this amendment what i undertook to do with that one <e>", "<cs> the practical effect of this amendment and let us be quite clear about it would be to perpetuate what many people feel is a sense of injustice and discrimination among the disabled people who would be affected <e> <s> the government have concluded on the basis of their experience over the last three years the arguments put forward in the house last spring and the many representations we have received from physically disabled tenants that this sense of unfair discrimination is very real and should be removed <e> <s> it arises particularly where tenants in adapted dwellings are denied the right to buy <e> <s> we believe the answer is to draw a clear distinction between dwellings purpose <e>", "<cs> i do not want to draw out the debate but i do not agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> when we speak about supply and demand we pre-suppose that dwellings which are bought are lost <e> <s> as with any other right to buy how can it be said that if a disabled person who lives in a home as a tenant buys it and continues to live in it as the owner-occupier the dwelling is lost to the availability of the housing pool for disabled people <e> <s> it is just not so <e> <s> what about all the thousands of pounds that the government give in grants for the conversion and the adaptation of homes for this purpose <e> <s> i recognise more clearly than does the noble baroness the fact that there are different points of view <e> <s> i am not sticking rigidly to the governments point of view <e> <s> i am taking the very fair suggestion i had it in mind to do so and was glad that the noble lady lady saltoun made the same point that we should come back with an amendment to give preemption rights to local authorites <e> <s> if the person who has bought the house wishes to sell it or if anybody else wishes to sell it the local authority will have the right to buy it back <e> <s> there can be no question therefore of it being lost to the pool of dwellings <e> <s> i do not accept however that it will be lost <e> <s> nevertheless accepting that there is another point of view the government are prepared and i hope it will be felt that they are being fair about this to take that line in this case <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness makes a very fair point <e> <s> i should like to consider it and tell her when we bring the matter back at report <e> <s> it is no good the noble <e>", "<cs> the question of estate agents does not arise <e> <s> it is the local authority the landlord who as previously would have the pre-emption right to buy back <e> <s> it does not apply to estate agents <e>", "<cs> it would depend on the extent of the original adaptation <e> <s> we are speaking of homes upon which considerable sums of money have been spent <e> <s> this almost touches upon the debate as regards the right to buy the elderly and the rest generally <e> <s> the fact is that we are speaking of what happens to that dwelling who occupies it who will continue to occupy it and who will have the right to buy <e> <s> we are told that profits will be made after the person dies <e> <s> that is one side of the case <e> <s> surely some credit must be given to the other side of the argument which was put forward by my noble friends lady lane-fox and lady masham of ilton <e> <s> we are trying to look at this matter fairly and properly <e> <s> there is another side to the argument <e> <s> disabled people are disadvantaged and are discriminated against <e> <s> we are trying to draw a balance between that and recognising that there is a case on the other side <e> <s> i believe that our proposal is a very fair one and i hope that my noble friend lord ingleby will feel the same <e>", "<cs> with great respect the noble lord just was not listening <e> <s> i am talking about giving a <e>", "<cs> that is a fair point and we will have to think about it <e>", "<cs> i thought we were talking about this seriously and we are talking about it seriously <e> <s> if the family continue to live in the house and this point has been made and it has been made by my noble friend lord swinfen as opposed to selling the house again the argument being that it is then lost to the disabled community and that is the point the noble baroness is making then that is a point we shall have to think about <e> <s> when we come back at report we may have a view on that <e> <s> i do not want to decide today what it will be <e> <s> if what we come hack with is not acceptable to the noble baroness and others then they will know what they have to do <e> <s> but to decide now is to decide not knowing what the offer is <e> <s> i believe that pre-emption is the only fair way to take account of the problems and real anxieties felt by a whole sector of the community <e> <s> why are we so intent on discriminating against people who are already discriminated against in so many other ways <e> <s> i am astonished that this is the feeling of some of your lordships <e>", "<cs> yes that is so <e> <s> i turn now to new paragraph which deals with sheltered housing for the elderly <e> <s> it may be helpful if i first quote in full the terms of the present paragraph <e> <s> this says <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is too modest when he talks about these few points <e> <s> there are just two observations that i want to make and then as the noble baroness very fairly said she would want to study what i have said i too shall want to study what my noble friend has said <e> <s> if it is necessary as i am sure it will be to talk about this matter again i should be glad to reply to my noble friend on that occasion or possibly write to him beforehand because at the moment notes are coming to me too quickly for me to refer to them and i should prefer to handle this matter in an orderly manner <e>", "<cs> there is no way i would concur in discriminating against males <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble baroness says <e> <s> i should not want to get into a semantic discussion on this question <e> <s> it was not quite the point that i had in mind when i raised the matter but frankly since we have so much to deal with if the noble baroness will allow me to say so i think we should perhaps proceed <e> <s> we shall probably come to that point in another context on the next amendment <e>", "<cs> it has been as i anticipated it would be an interesting debate <e> <s> i shall try to respond in detail to the various points which have been raised <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord will bear with me i made a note of the points that he made and i am coming to them shortly <e> <s> if younger tenants buy and do indeed at some point reap the value of their discount some people will say that would be called a windfall as i have said <e> <s> but why should an older tenant not have the satisfaction of ownership for <e>", "<cs> i did not interrupt a single person who spoke earlier i make it my way not to do so <e> <s> it is very difficult to develop an argument if i am always being interrupted <e> <s> of course i give way to my noble friend briefly i hope and then may i please ask your lordships to at least allow me to finish my speech <e>", "<cs> as i said to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale a moment ago i now make the same point to my noble friend i am just about to reach that very point <e> <s> i do ask to be allowed to make it in my own way <e> <s> the fact is that inheritance in the bill as drafted would not count as a disposal triggering the pre-emption covenant so the inheritor most probably a son or daughter could take over say a bungalow without having to offer it back to the local authority but could move in or let it or use it as a holiday home <e> <s> in the one situation where pre-emption has been in place these last few years that is the rural areas experience has in fact shown up no such thing and that must be a far better guide to likelihood than any theoretical arguments <e> <s> most families simply will not be in a position to let a bungalow or keep it as a holiday home <e> <s> when the time comes they will want to sell and when they do sell the pre-emption covenant will come into play <e> <s> where relatives are already living in the house it is surely entirely right that they should be able to stay on <e> <s> in many cases such relatives even children will themselves be in their s and s by the time they inherit <e>", "<cs> the local government planning and land act came into effect after the housing act <e> <s> as a result it was necessary to make provision in the local government act to apply the provisions of chapters i and ii of the housing act to urban development corporations <e> <s> this bill proposes certain amendments to the housing act so that there will be a reference to urban development corporations on the face of the housing legislation <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord simon of glaisdale for his helpful comments <e> <s> i believe he will be particularly interested when we reach that part of the bill which refers to the right of exchange where the whole question of mobility is clearly highlighted <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will be pleased with what is proposed there <e> <s> one purpose of clause as has been said is to reduce the residential qualifying period from three years to two <e> <s> the amendment seeks to retain the present three years rule <e> <s> the right to buy applies only to secure tenants <e> <s> secure tenants are people who have been granted a tenancy of a house or flat on a long-term basis <e> <s> they will be entitled to remain in that dwelling for the rest of their lives <e> <s> in some circumstances the tenancy will pass on to their successors <e>", "<cs> first of all i say to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton that he is really debating the whole theology of the right to buy <e> <s> we went through it all in <e> <s> even those of your lordships who have spoken and voted against the government on the other amendments accept that this is now a fact of life <e> <s> it is a very popular idea in the country even among those who have not bought <e> <s> people are content to know that they have the right if they so wish <e> <s> if pressed i shall be happy to go over all the arguments <e> <s> believe me i need no notes to do that <e> <s> i could talk for perhaps an hour <e>", "<cs> if only the noble lord had allowed me to finish i should have come to his point <e> <s> unlike the suppositions in the original article our million was not plucked out of the air <e> <s> we estimated the likely cost of the scheme by taking a look at the actual take-up of the right to buy among tenants of non-charitable housing associations <e> <s> in the first three years of the operation of the right to buy around per cent <e> <s> of eligible tenants exercised the right to buy <e> <s> given that the tenants of charitable housing associations are generally older and poorer than those of non-charitable housing associations there seems no reason to expect the take-up for this scheme to be any higher <e> <s> i believe that our estimate for the cost of the scheme for next year is realistic and i do not expect the figure to be significantly exceeded <e> <s> but the noble lord is right that really is for another occasion <e> <s> i can only respond as i did to the other point which he made <e>", "<cs> in the case of the charitable housing associations that we are referring to he certainly has to have the lease in his name <e> <s> indeed he would only have such a lease if he was the resident <e> <s> if my noble friend fears that there may be some jiggery-pokery i shall he glad to pursue that point <e> <s> i think that i should he able to satisfy him on it either now or on another occasion <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is basically correct <e> <s> it is almost like saying make me an offer <e> <s> i said that it is true that once a person is a secure tenant no one can move him or her out of that dwelling <e> <s> there is logic in what she says <e> <s> i promise her that i shall consider it and discuss it with my friends <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord northfield i have seen some of the situations he has described <e> <s> and my goodness i have duplicated that all round the country <e> <s> i see the tremendous pride that people now have in their homes <e> <s> you can walk round these housing estates these massive i hate to use the word but i do ghettos of vast housing estates <e> <s> then you see some or privately owned dwellings which stand out like beacons <e> <s> what is more they lift up the whole level of the housing around them <e> <s> and yes the occupants are painting the doors different colours <e> <s> they are fitting their own doors <e> <s> the gardens are a delight to see <e> <s> people are doing this themselves <e> <s> they are not waiting as they always had to do for the authorities every now and then to send someone round <e> <s> this has done more to give a lift to the quality of housing around our country than anything else <e> <s> i did not want to get involved in this <e>", "<cs> but i have because i was provoked <e> <s> when noble lords opposite complain about the implications of the right to buy may i remind them that it is they who constantly tell us about the need for greater equalisation of the wealth of the country <e> <s> what could there ever have been that was more effective in equalising wealth than to give or it will not be long before the figure is a million families an actual capital stake of their own which they would never otherwise have had <e> <s> i could give a whole string of benefits that flow from the sale of council houses accruing not least as the <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> if anyone is able to sympathise with the noble baroness lady fisher for leaving in such circumstances it is i myself <e> <s> i seek often to do the same but do not succeed too frequently <e> <s> however that is really the point that i want to make <e> <s> i recognise that an extension is involved but we believe deeply in the policy <e> <s> we think that it is effective that it is working and that it is good <e>", "<cs> if i may just answer that this is exactly what they said to me in and <e> <s> if i took the noble lord round leeds which it would be my very great pleasure to do i should show him houses of all types bought in every single part of the city and i think he would be very impressed not just by what he saw but by what the people who bought them actually said to him about their purchases <e>", "<cs> the noble lord makes so many points that he must not really accuse me of taking time in diverting from the main thrust of the amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady fisher was talking about the governments employment policies <e> <s> various other matters have been raised by the noble lord lord hylton <e> <s> others have asked different questions <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> the situation that the noble lord lord monson has described is indeed the position as it is now <e> <s> i wonder how many council houses have two acres of land attached to them <e> <s> if there are such houses the position is that that land would be valued and the tenant would have to pay for the hope value <e> <s> it would all be part of the valuation <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord monson fears the reason it has not come about can be answered by the question how many council houses are sited in two acres of land <e>", "<cs> it would indeed have to be valued by the district valuer or whoever was dealing with the valuation <e> <s> it is done in different ways by different authorities <e> <s> the noble lord is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> what is reasonable is for the dv to say in his judgment but if it is felt that that is not a reasonable judgment or if say one of the houses in the noble lords new town was to be under-valued then i am sure it would be open to him to say am i missing the point <e>", "<cs> i now understand and it is a totally different point <e> <s> i would take a reasonable assessment of that as to what would be reasonable <e> <s> i suspect that the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale who has been so interestingly involving himself in this would give a far better definition than either i or the noble lord <e> <s> lord northfield <e> <s> but clearly this is a point on which i had better write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> just as i might have expected and indeed as i forecast the noble and learned lord <e> <s> lord simon of glaisdale has it exactly correct <e> <s> i am told that ultimately it would be a question for the courts to decide under section of the act <e> <s> but clearly as this is a matter of some concern both to the noble lord and to the noble baroness lady birk and because of the noble and learned lords interest i propose to write a much more detailed clarification of this point to them <e>", "<cs> might i say that i will look forward to receiving the correspondence and detail that my noble friend lord kinnoull will send me <e> <s> when i receive that i shall want to look into its implications <e> <s> but i think i ought to put on the record because it would be helpful to him to the bpf and to my noble friend who has just spoken exactly what the position is and why the government feel that they have difficulty in accepting these amendments <e> <s> there has been a considerable amount of correspondence between ministers and the bpf on the points of concern which we thought we had been able to deal with satisfactorily <e> <s> they are points which my noble friend lord kinnoull has raised again today <e> <s> the bpf fears that the limitation on the ground rent payable by the right-to-buy leaseholder to per annum in cases where the local authority is contractually obliged to pay the freeholder a higher amount could considerably reduce the value of the freeholders interest since the rent will be therefore secured not any longer on the property but on the goodwill of the local authority <e>", "<cs> i am sure that despite the hour the committee listened with as much fascination as i did to the way in which the noble lord went to considerable trouble to examine the nuts and bolts of the bills wording <e> <s> i assure him readily that i will have all this discussed in great depth and that every word of his on the record will be one to which i will respond in written form as i am sure he would expect me to do <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble baroness that clause is bound up with clause and in view of the committees earlier decision we shall need to look at <e>", "<cs> i do not seek in any way to anticipate what the reaction of my colleagues will be following the matters that took place earlier <e> <s> i do not want to go into detail but what i meant earlier was that i thought that the suggestions i was making as part of that debate or part of the package that we were then proposing were extremely helpful <e> <s> but there is no point in going over that now <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to delete that part of clause which will enable the secretary of state to direct the removal or modification of covenants and conditions in right-to-buy conveyances or leases <e> <s> that is the effect of it so far as i am aware <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham has made much of interfering retrospectively with legal transactions which have already taken place <e> <s> i respect that concern <e> <s> nevertheless i believe that it is right to retain this retrospective element in the proposed provision and i have explained why <e> <s> the proposed power of direction will apply only in limited circumstances <e> <s> perhaps i may try to explain why in those circumstances it may on occasion make sense to apply the effect direction equally to future and completed sales <e>", "<cs> this amendment as the noble baroness says seeks to delete subsection of clause <e> <s> that subsection in fact does no more than dictate the priority of charges where a tenant/purchaser has received both legal aid and assistance under the proposed new clause power <e> <s> in such cases both the legal aid fund and the secretary of state will have a claim against any costs or expenses payable to the tenant/purchaser as a result of court action or a compromise settlement <e> <s> the subsection provides that the legal aid fund shall have priority in such cases <e> <s> i see nothing to be gained by deleting it <e>", "<cs> i am not certain <e> <s> i think that that is right but clearly i shall have to confirm it and i shall do so both to my noble friend and to the noble baroness lady birk for her record <e>", "<cs> i ought really to apologise to my noble friend lord coleraine because i jumped the gun earlier when in connection with amendments nos <e> <s> and as long ago as that was i responded to this because at the time i thought we were grouping this amendment with the earlier ones <e> <s> however rather than go again over what i said earlier clearly the record will show what i said i want to read carefully what he said which i thought was interesting <e> <s> i am not without sympathy to some of the underlying theology to which he referred <e> <s> therefore i hope he will allow me tonight indeed the same applies in responding to the noble lord lord monson to say that we want to read the careful observations which he made <e> <s> he knows that i have been in correspondence with him on these matters <e> <s> one tries to get out exactly what is required and to see how far if at all one can go and that i undertake to do <e> <s> i think he knows i could not accept this amendment as it is but i am happy to pursue the matter with him <e>", "<cs> i noted that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton supported an identical amendment last year in another place and in his previous incarnation <e> <s> but i have heard nothing which convinces me that this amendment is any more acceptable now than it was then <e> <s> the philosophy underlying the housing act and this bill is that where the right to buy exists restrictions on resale should he kept to an absolute minimum <e> <s> it is true that we have made two exceptions one in the case of sales in national parks and other rural areas and the other in the case of dwellings particularly suitable for the elderly under clause of this bill <e> <s> but in both <e>", "<cs> i do not recall the particular instance that the noble lord mentions being specifically referred to <e> <s> my noble friend lord kinnoull said he would write to me with details and when i received them i said i would be glad to look at them carefully and comment upon them <e> <s> if the noble lord lord monson is interested i will happily make the same information available to him <e>", "<cs> i shall be very glad to write as detailed an explanatory note as i can for the noble baroness and for anybody else who wishes to have it <e> <s> i could then deal with any queries which the noble baroness may have after which she can decide what she wishes to do about it at report <e>", "<cs> as far as i am aware this is the first time that there has been any call for such an amendment and i was interested in what my noble friend lord sandford had to say <e> <s> there are always questions that need to be considered closely and i can see difficulties in this <e> <s> perhaps i may explain <e> <s> let me take first the question of succession <e> <s> for good reason there is no provision in section for any minimum or maximum time in which to decide who shall succeed and an alert landlord will quickly know when there has been a succession <e> <s> in most cases there will be no doubt about who is to succeed but if a person is qualified to succeed and wishes the landlord to choose <e>", "<cs> in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> is the noble baroness speaking also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal has tabled four amendments which variously modify the proposed provisions governing dwellings let to employees which are within the curtilage of educational buildings <e> <s> in fact the amendments would affect educational authorities as a whole but i note that the noble baroness has specifically referred to ilea <e> <s> the department is in touch with the authority about certain aspects of what she has said <e> <s> it might be helpful if i explained the situation in more detail and perhaps picked up the points that the four amendments raise <e> <s> i believe that similar arguments underlie each of them <e> <s> i should make it clear straight away that i accept that there is a point of substance here which i feel must be considered further <e>", "<cs> the noble lord makes his point extremely well if i may say so and very persuasively <e> <s> i say at once that i am not without sympathy for what he says <e> <s> yes i know of the type of situation that he describes <e> <s> but as he very fairly says there are problems about what the new clause proposes <e> <s> it is concerned with a couple who either have parted or wish to part and one of them notifies the landlord of this <e> <s> the landlord can then go to court and accommodate both partners separately <e> <s> so far so good <e> <s> but what happens in practice is that it will not be the tenant who notifies the landlord <e> <s> if the tenant no longer wishes to live in the family home he or she can simply surrender the tenancy and there would then be no need for any new ground for possession <e> <s> alternatively he or she may be able to assign the tenancy to the other partner <e>", "<cs> i will indeed <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for those comments <e>", "<cs> at the moment i do not have any information on that but i will try to ascertain the current situation of the booth committee and will notify the noble lord <e> <s> lord simon of glaisdale the noble baroness lady birk and the noble lord lord graham accordingly <e>", "<cs> secure tenants have had the right to take in lodgers without needing their landlords consent since and so far as i know this is the first rumbling of discontent if i can put it that way with this provision <e> <s> i was interested in what my noble friend lord sandford had to say <e> <s> the tenants charter gives a range of rights to council tenants and others and enables them to have a greater say in housing matters concerning their homes <e> <s> the right to take in lodgers is one such right where a tenant is judged to know best whether to take advantage of the opportunity <e> <s> the lodger might be a relative or a friend and would doubtless contribute or perhaps contribute towards the rent <e> <s> in addition tenants who take in lodgers can be helping to solve another persons accommodation problem <e> <s> lodgers present no problems for landlords since the secure tenant is not parting with possession of any part of his home <e> <s> there seems to be no good reason why tenants in sheltered accommodation should have their rights limited while they are actually living in the dwelling even if they should not be given the right to buy <e> <s> if as a result a dwelling were to become overcrowded within the meaning of the act the landlord might in the last resort decide to have recourse to ground of schedule to the act the overcrowding ground to seek repossession <e>", "<cs> may i take the unusual step of begging to move that clause shall not stand part of the bill and in saying that to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and in which it will be found that there is a new clause which is a division of technical provisions in clause which it replaces <e>", "<cs> the problem always is how to respond in a reasonable period of time to the many points which have been made <e> <s> in doing so one always disappoints some of those who have made contributions <e> <s> i am grateful to everybody who has spoken <e> <s> the debate has been of a particularly high order <e> <s> i ask in advance to be excused if i do not cover all the points which have been made <e> <s> if i miss any important points i shall write to noble lords and carry the debate further outside the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords we made a commitment to which we will adhere but of course the observations and comments made will be analysed and reported <e> <s> we shall see what they constructively may add to those proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords the report does exactly the opposite it confirms the opportunities that exist <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends what the press statement says <e> <s> i think the one that my right honourable friend put out was sufficiently succinct to make the point which we have made all along namely that you can in these reports get out many answers it depends what you feed in and on the suppositions upon which you base the reports <e> <s> i thought that my right honourable friends response was a very full one <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i have seen this put forward <e>", "<cs> of course my lords but they themselves said the suppositions upon which they based their conclusions were varied in that they could not know what the decisions of the boroughs and districts would be at the time that they made those decisions as to what their spending would be in relation to the functions they were taking over <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have thought the last thing that would be a good idea would be to let things go on as they are at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation which the proposed legislation is to deal with is such that the government feel that the matter cannot be left to an inquiry such as the noble lord suggests which he would be the first to agree would take years to produce a report <e> <s> the fact is that the situation cannot be allowed to go on as it is at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is entirely up to the noble baroness to do that through the normal channels <e>", "<cs> my lords the government think all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased that the noble baroness refers specifically to an area which both she and i know so well <e> <s> yes of course we are concerned about that matter and the particular service involved too <e> <s> but i see no reason why what is proposed should lead to any deterioration in the service <e> <s> in any case i would advise the noble baroness to be a little patient until we come up with more specific details at the end of the day in response to the consultation and i suspect that she will not be as concerned then as she seems to be now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord feels that my response is to quote him a pious ministerial statement <e> <s> i would have ascribed more to it than that <e> <s> if the noble lord will read carefully what i said in my initial reply he will see that the specific type of instance that he mentions is in fact to be dealt with by the historic buildings and monuments commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can add much to what i have already said <e> <s> i am still satisfied at the end of the day that the boroughs and districts themselves will be no less responsible in attitude than i think they have always been <e> <s> what is different now is that in the last years in the case of the metropolitan districts and areas and in the last years in the case of london there have been built up certain types of bodies which are doing good work <e> <s> i remain very confident that the authorities which will succeed will be as responsible as everyone else has been in the last few years <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i hear what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords i felt that it was for the convenience of the house for the amendments to be taken together in that they are all linked and they relate to the government proposals to extend the right to buy to certain county council tenancies <e> <s> if your lordships feel that you would prefer me not to deal with them in this way then of course i shall be quite happy to deal with them as your lordships would wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i will try to deal not too shortly with this matter but not be too long and i hope to give a proper explanation <e> <s> as i have said these amendments relate to the proposals to extend the right to buy to certain county council tenancies broadly those that are not being used for operational purposes and the related proposals to modify the provisions in the act governing tenancies held other than under general powers <e> <s> in earlier debates on these proposals i said that we had consulted the local authority associations about their detail <e> <s> i also undertook further to consider a number of points raised in committee by noble baronesses on both sides of the house and by others of your lordships <e> <s> most of those amendments are in response to comments and suggestions from the associations and to points raised in committee <e> <s> perhaps i may now speak to each of the amendments concerned <e> <s> i take the point raised by the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> i begin by referring to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house may i just say that the noble lord lord graham did not ask that they be taken separately <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i shall meet your lordships wishes so far as this goes <e> <s> i had understood that all this had been generally agreed and it is somewhat disconcerting to assume that that is not so <e> <s> if it is not so i shall ask questions elsewhere <e> <s> however if it is so i am in your lordships hands <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i accede to the wishes of the noble baroness and the noble and learned lord <e> <s> but i am bound to say that it does not augur well for the future conduct of agreements about business arrangements of this kind <e> <s> however i shall gladly take it as it is <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most unreasonable comment <e> <s> we have had a perfectly proper suggestion from the noble and learned lord and a point has been raised by the front bench opposite which i accept without question if that is the wish of the house <e> <s> to imply that in some way there has been an attempt not to give information or to stifle information is completely wrong and i take the noble viscount lord hanworth to task <e> <s> may i say how difficult it is to decide on groupings until we have the marshalled list <e> <s> the marshalled list arrived in my department at today and we dispatched it to everybody concerned by oclock <e> <s> i do not consider that that was in any way dilatory or means that we were holding something back <e> <s> all it does is to illustrate the difficulty of dealing with the amendments <e> <s> however i am very happy to accede to the request that we should get on and discuss them in any order that your lordships may wish <e> <s> that surely must be the only matter at issue <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of my knowledge the normal convention is that it is distributed to the opposition parties the cross-benchers and to anybody else who wishes to receive a copy <e> <s> there is no secret about this <e> <s> it is merely a question of what is convenient for the working of your lordships house <e> <s> in five years i have never been challenged in this way on this point <e> <s> during that time i have dealt with about bills so i am not rising to my feet as a beginner <e> <s> the fact is that there has always been a very fair attempt to work together in this way <e> <s> now that this matter has been raised i have said that i am quite content to deal with it in whatever way your lordships may wish <e> <s> i do not think we need to go further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say first of all to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale that i am sure he was absolutely right when he said that he heard the guns from still being fired <e> <s> as one who was involved in the battle i endorse that <e> <s> it is something of which i have constantly complained if you like throughout every bill since then <e> <s> i think that this is now the fifth housing bill that i have dealt with since then <e> <s> we always come back to the underlying difference in theology between this and the other side of the house <e> <s> frankly i see nothing wrong in that <e> <s> when we talk of the right to buy feelings run very deeply and there is an absolute difference between us <e> <s> there it is <e> <s> i do not think that it will be resolved today or possibly at any other time <e> <s> as i am referring to the comments of the noble and learned lord lord simon perhaps i could say to my noble friend lord broxbourne that of course i listen with respect <e> <s> i listen with respect to what every noble lord says from whichever side of the house <e> <s> i like to think that i always do that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can revert to what the noble lord lord molson says in a few moments <e> <s> a number of your lordships have spoken <e> <s> may i say to the noble baroness lady faithfull that <e>", "<cs> point taken my lords <e> <s> this matter brings us back once again to the question of which education authority dwellings should be excluded from security of tenure and the right-to-buy <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say is that there is no answer to that certainly not one that i have <e> <s> i want to come back to this again later <e> <s> clearly we will be doing so when we are talking in the later amendments <e> <s> by that time i will certainly discuss the matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may just comment on that observation by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter i confess i have never heard of the keeling schedules <e> <s> i should want to take advice on this and i shall certainly do soi can make no comment on it but i know it was meant to be helpful <e> <s> my noble friend always tries to be helpful and invariably is <e> <s> clearly i shall need to take advice and i will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has been in this house longer than i have and i bow to her greater knowledge on that point <e> <s> i will take advice and come back to it <e> <s> may i thank the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for his very fair observations <e> <s> it is actually for the landlord to decide in the first instance whether the ground for possession applies and he would then have to go to the court to seek possession <e> <s> as to dismissal for behaviour reasons again that would depend on the offence <e> <s> it is very hard to list a number of hypothetical situations in which it would arise <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham has spent time in local government and i am sure on housing and he will know as i do of many situations where a local authority as the landlord has difficulties of that kind <e> <s> i can think of some to talk about at some length <e> <s> i can best deal with the point by saying that the local authority as the landlords would have to decide in the first instance whether or not they wished to institute any proceedings on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not mind at all if my noble friend wishes to make observations <e> <s> however i bear in mind the best interests of work in general terms <e> <s> we have strayed several times today from the regular procedures <e> <s> as i say i am always very content to respond to anyone but i suspect that it may not be too helpful to the general business for me to say that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can just say something to the noble lord lord hylton <e> <s> not for the first time he raises his general concern about housing in its broadest sense <e> <s> i do not quarrel with him that the need to take the broadest look and to give the broadest attention to many aspects of housing is something that should concern this government and i tell him that it does concern this government <e> <s> if i were speaking in the broadest terms of housing generally and that really is not what we are supposed to be doing in the report stage of this bill then i should want to tell him of the measures that the government are taking and have taken to tackle the whole problem of housing in its broadest sense <e> <s> so while it is not difficult to make the point that he makes i can tell him that in fact as i know he knows from the many debates which he and i have had in the last five years from discussion of the very first housing bill the situation is much broader than the narrow confines of what we are proposing in this right-to-buy legislation <e> <s> the fact is that housing is <e>", "<cs> my lords schedule a will be a new schedule and it is amended by these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can help the noble lord <e> <s> in fact amendment no <e> <s> introduces part i of schedule a at page line and amendment no <e> <s> introduces part ii at page line <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble and learned lord lord simon hears the guns thundering yet louder all the time the debate goes on <e> <s> certainly i do <e> <s> i must therefore bring up some of my own <e> <s> again and again noble lords opposite are protesting we are not against home ownership we are not against the selling of council houses <e> <s> every word they now utter as they uttered in disproves that all the way down the line <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i explain briefly the background to the provision <e> <s> section of the act permits the parties to agree to the inclusion of <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house that is not the problem we are discussing <e> <s> the problem occurs where there is land which is part of the whole of the dwelling <e> <s> if we were talking only about the land on which the house itself was built then we would not he discussing this matter at all <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house i should have thought that a development of acres of potatoes would not be reasonable at all and that very few courts would so hold <e> <s> nevertheless i <e>", "<cs> my lords in a case such as the noble viscount instances and there may be others i would say that wherever there is uncertainty then if the point was pressed by either party the court would have to decide the position <e> <s> if i am told that the answer is something else then i shall certainly inform the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i cannot help the noble lord <e> <s> i say again that i appreciate the argument he has put forward <e> <s> i said to my noble friend that i will look at the wording he suggested and i will certainly do so <e> <s> but i cannot go as far as the noble lord lord graham of edmonton wishes me to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i say at once that i should certainly not have the temerity to say that the noble and learned lord was wrong in a field in which he has so much expertise and knowledge <e> <s> we including the draftsman and all others concerned must as always consider very carefully what he says <e> <s> based upon his first remarks my feeling is that he is actually right about the negative point <e> <s> i say that not in surprise <e> <s> had it been otherwise i should have been surprised <e> <s> we accept without question that the noble and learned lord is seeking to make sure that we have a bill with the clearest possible wording so that there is no room for misunderstanding or whatever <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord will allow me i shall gladly undertake to take this away again in the light of what he has said to see whether we can get it even better in the last stages of the bill <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> if i may i should like the house to agree to it at the present time with the undertaking that we shall look at it again and if necessary bring back another form of amendment on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lord i say at once that i most certainly do take into account what the noble and learned lord says and i am not in the coach and horses business at all <e> <s> may i just make one or two observations on this which i feel perhaps ought to be said <e> <s> of course a principal purpose of clause is to add certain other categories of disposal to those that are exempt from this discount clawback provision <e> <s> the amendment as the noble and learned lord has explained does in fact operate on the basic definition of disposal for the purposes of the discount clawback provisions which has been in force since <e> <s> the definition originally appears in section of the act <e> <s> a disposal is defined <e>", "<cs> my lords what does one say after that except yes of course we shall certainly want to look again and see if we can come up with something which makes it yet better <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his suggestions for improving the drafting of clause of the bill <e> <s> his suggestions have already resulted in some improvement in the intelligibility of the legislation as we have seen from earlier amendments <e> <s> we shall wish to study more closely in <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for making that point which i shall certainly take up <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady birk has explained this amendment would delete paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness says she did not understand it i withdraw absolutely the last point <e> <s> probably we should have made it clearer <e> <s> i take the responsibility for it not having been made sufficiently clear <e> <s> in view of the fact that i have now made it clearer i hope that i need not make any further points and that the noble baroness will not wish to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house and again in the interests of time i would say that it seems that this is an area that i should like to discuss with the noble baroness <e> <s> so far as i am concerned we are talking here about small disposals involving small sums of money nothing more than that <e> <s> i am satisfied that when we discuss it in depth with the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the intention of the noble baroness is simply to tidy up the bill and to remove the apparent conflict between clause and clause then i have to say that the amendment is ill-conceived <e> <s> there are a number of consequential amendments for example in clause and schedule that would need to be made if clause were removed and which are obviously not taken into account by this amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness knows as well as i do that it is usual and less messy to take all such matters together in one tidying-up operation and i can therefore only conclude that in proposing the amendment what she really seeks to do not unreasonably is to try to draw out a statement of the governments intention <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time today the noble and learned lord is right <e> <s> all of us accept that <e> <s> i am deeply grateful to my noble friend lord molson for stating exactly the governments position <e> <s> the government made certain proposals <e> <s> unfortunately the house decided to divide upon them before we were given the opportunity to say exactly what they were <e> <s> it is because of the absence of that explanation that we are in this position today <e> <s> clearly i am not in a position to give the details of our proposals <e> <s> however i have no reason to doubt that if it is decided to make any change which has yet to be decided and because certain things have got to be done in any case they too will have to be decided once the government have come to their own conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i am glad that the noble and learned lord drew our attention to the need to speak on this <e> <s> i had intended to do so but we were rushing through all the first part and we missed this out <e> <s> certainly it was not my intention so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house we had points of this kind made earlier by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale suggesting that certain alterations need to be made <e> <s> i accepted that without question and said i would need to consult the draftsman <e> <s> that we will do <e> <s> it does not basically alter the intention underlying the amendment <e> <s> as i said a moment ago and this is something your lordships may recall i said when i introduced these particular amendments i was informed that they were not controversial at all and that they were agreed as far as the principle was concerned <e> <s> if we have it wrong in the drafting despite what i said about subsection in view of what my noble friend lord selkirk said and especially in view of what was said by the noble and learned lord i shall want to look at it again <e> <s> it is merely a question of how we do it <e> <s> we can withdraw the amendment now and reinstate it or pass it now with my undertaking that i will look at it again and your lordships know that i do not give an undertaking if i do not mean it <e> <s> it is a question of the simplest way of dealing with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to be helpful here <e> <s> i shall certainly take up the point that my noble friend raises about who pays <e> <s> i think the answer is the one that he gave <e> <s> that would be my thinking but clearly i should want to check that out <e> <s> my only reservation about withdrawing this is that i do not really think that that is what we ought to be doing <e> <s> if we do that i think it implies something else <e> <s> i am not sure whether i agree with my noble friend lord selkirk on the underlying desirability of having this provision in at all <e> <s> i fear that if we withdraw it the implication is something else and the noble baroness lady birk will not hesitate to draw it to our attention when it eventually comes back in what ever state it re-emerges <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord skelmersdale will be responding to the amendment and i certainly do not wish to make a second reading speech on the whole underlying theology of housing repairs <e> <s> i shall not say tempted as i am to do so- but it is a vast subject as the noble lord lord dean of beswick rightly points out <e> <s> however i feel that i must take one minute of your lordships time because the noble lord specifically mentioned leeds with which i am familiar having been the chairman of housing there for several years <e>", "<cs> my lords by the leave of the house if i may just very quickly make one or two observations on what has been said <e> <s> the noble viscount <e> <s> lord hanworth said that the bill does nothing for private rented accommodation but of course private rented accommodation is not provided by public funds therefore it is not part of this matter at all <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson said that tenants will be better off because they will have a choice of location <e> <s> you have to weigh that against the fact that you will not be able to continue in the home in which you may have lived for some years <e> <s> you can argue that that is a plus or a minus as you see it <e> <s> but certainly i cannot say that there would be a reduction in the maximum <e> <s> what we are setting out to do is to give a discount as near as we can get it equivalent to what would pertain under the right to buy from a local authority association dwelling certainly not less but then again not more either <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that is not correct <e> <s> where a local authority grants a mortgage on an existing dwelling which is in its possession the authority as the landlord first of all knows the state of the property since it has been responsible for it for a long time <e> <s> people buying a house under this scheme will be treated in exactly the same way as any other purchaser on the open market <e> <s> in order to obtain a mortgage and i should think that my noble friend knows more about this aspect than does anyone else in your lordships house the applicant will have to satisfy the building society that his income is adequate not only to buy the house but to be able to maintain it <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> i take note of the concern which my noble friend expresses <e> <s> we have talked about it not least because he himself has drawn it to our attention on more than one occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords we talked about amendment no <e> <s> previoulsy <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble baroness in what she has just said was referring also to amendment no <e> <s> which i had understood might be covered <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the landlords interests will be adequately safeguarded under the arrangements we are now proposing <e> <s> the question is whether landlords will be in a position to gain possession of such dwellings when they need to do so for operational reasons <e> <s> there are three grounds for possession that i think are particularly relevant <e> <s> first the new <e>", "<cs> my lords cemeteries as well <e> <s> the noble baroness will have to take it from me that she has spoken to me about all matters of this kind which are of concern to her <e> <s> i want to say that we have considered very carefully what provisions are appropriate to ensure that landlords retain control over dwellings which are needed for operational purposes and at the same time we are conscious not to ride roughshod over the reasonable expectations of tenants and certainly not to deprive them of the rights which were conferred in which is what amendment no <e> <s> would do <e> <s> i am sorry i cannot be more helpful <e> <s> know that the noble baroness raises these matters in good faith because of her concern <e> <s> this happens to be an area where i share that concern <e> <s> i really think that her fears are groundless <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i have no keys and i have no reasons i have just a few reasons which i should like to submit to your lordships <e> <s> they are as follows <e> <s> i have already made clear both in this house and in correspondence with the noble and learned lord the governments attitude towards consolidation <e> <s> the government fully accept the need for consolidation of the housing legislation <e> <s> the last exercise indeed was in <e> <s> under the aegis of the law commission the parliamentary draftsman has been working full time on this consolidation since late <e> <s> he is also being assisted by the former solicitor and legal adviser to my department who has a vast amount of experience in housing legislation and who is advising on the various policy decisions in the department <e> <s> he is also acting as a point of liaison between the department and the law commission as the work proceeds <e>", "<cs> yes within two months <e> <s> i know that this is not entirely to the noble and learned lords satisfaction but i hope he will agree that it will be of assistance to those who need to study the text of the act and that it represents a very significant improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords the point is what it is that we would produce in four months and what it is that would be produced within two months <e> <s> if i may repeat what i said on what could be produced within two months we have offered to produce within four months of receiving it the queens printers copy of the act after royal assent <e> <s> however what we have offered to produce within two months is the paper by the editor of <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> to do that i should have to start at the beginning and go over all of it again <e> <s> i did not mention december <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say first that i think apologies are due to the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> the information came to her late it should have come sooner <e> <s> we should make no bones about that at all and i say so without any hesitation <e> <s> i am sorry that it happened <e> <s> i hope she will agree that it is something that does not too often happen in the legislation with which i deal <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of my knowledge i think the noble and learned lord lord simon is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement on education in inner london which is now being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science <e> <s> the statement reads as follows the government have been considering the responses to the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady david and to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for their responses to the statement <e> <s> in reply to the questions they raised and in the main they tended to be similar ones the noble baroness asked if this why not the glc <e> <s> there can be no doubt that ilea is in many ways a unique establishment <e> <s> the fact is that it is a unique establishment in what it spends alone <e> <s> even leaving aside what it spends in relation to what it should spend the fact is that its needs are so great we cannot compare it with any other education body in the country <e> <s> we cannot even compare it with any of the other composed joint boards <e> <s> it is truly unique and when these points were made in the consultation we felt that not only were they very valid in themselves but the people making them the unbiased people making them were such that we should give to this the weight that we have given <e> <s> so we see that there is a difference and the two things do not necessarily have to go together <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> i think that all of your lordships will know of his immense pleasure and interest in this whole subject and i was glad to hear what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am second to none in my appreciation of and respect for the education lobby not only in london but throughout the whole of the country <e> <s> yes the parents and those who are concerned with education have always in my experience taken a passionate interest in this particular service for reasons which are obvious to all of us certainly to everyone who is a parent <e> <s> as regards the review i think that the noble baroness will have to wait for the details <e> <s> the main bill will contain a provision for review but i am not today able to give any more detail than that about it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank my noble friend for what he has said and i am sure that with his particular background and relationship with the ilea it will receive special weight <e> <s> of course i so much applaud what he said about what we should like education to be that is apolitical <e> <s> in so far as it is possible to put the emphasis on that being so this government will try to do so <e> <s> but i fear that at the end of the day it will still be the decision of the people who are elected to it to decide the direction in which it will go <e> <s> as for the financial aspects of it i said that for the first three years this is unusual in the same way as will pertain to the joint boards the overall budget will have to be approved <e> <s> that is the first structure <e> <s> that is because as we learned in it is those critical first structures and financial budgets that can so often set a financial pattern to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that when my noble friend lady gardner reads <e>", "<cs> my lords one can play around with semantics and terms <e> <s> the staff position is something which will be decided by the members when they are elected <e> <s> there is no intention at all to cause disruption <e> <s> frankly it is not helpful to talk today about disruption <e> <s> disruption does not enter into it <e> <s> this is about doing something which has received acceptance all round and which i think will generally be welcomed <e> <s> it has got nothing at all to do with disruption <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment derives from our discussions at an earlier stage about the costs of the new scheme and its implications for the rest of the housing corporations programme <e> <s> there is no persuasive reason for treating resource allocation for this modest low-cost home ownership initiative for that is what it is separately from the other elements of the housing corporations programme which have similar objectives <e> <s> i see no reason for that on cost grounds nor is there any case in terms of administrative efficiency <e> <s> in fact the arguments are all in favour of the way we have chosen to provide for the scheme through the housing corporations approved development programme <e> <s> this programme is the right place to accommodate the expenditure <e> <s> there is a grant mechanism housing association grant which is readily available and which already meets other calls for publicly-funded housing association capital expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i would say that what the noble baroness lady denington very fairly describes is a situation that is not at all unreasonable and of course no one is saying that million is the exact figure because we do not know <e> <s> we are saying that it is a likely figure as we see the situation <e> <s> i think that it is a very reasonable one to put forward otherwise i would not have made the case as i have done <e> <s> but having said that i shall certainly undertake to bring to the notice of colleagues what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> she knows how the system <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps once more with the leave of the house i can intervene <e> <s> yes i am sure first of all <e> <s> that the amount of money involved must be separately identified <e> <s> it has to be identified <e> <s> i am sure that it is our intention to do so <e> <s> as to whether it should actually be presented in some other way i shall talk to my colleagues and see if this can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem is that there is a clear failure to appreciate the significance of this <e> <s> let me try to explain the position <e> <s> basically the government cannot accept that these tenants these particular tenants should be viewed any differently from tenants who happen to live in council dwellings <e> <s> they are exactly the same and should be given neither more nor less <e> <s> they should not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> i should like at the outset to thank your lordships for the careful consideration which has been given to this bill <e> <s> it is a bill with a somewhat chequered history <e> <s> we had almost reached this stage last may when the general election was called and parliament was dissolved and the bill was lost <e> <s> that of course some would say was a small price to pay for the result that then followed but perhaps not everyone would agree with that <e> <s> nevertheless i regret that many tenants who were pinning their hopes on new provisions in the bill have had to wait another year <e> <s> i think i can safely say that the same fate will not befall the present bill and their waiting will soon be at an end <e>", "<cs> i am quite prepared to sit down if any noble lord wishes to stand up <e> <s> what if the present irresponsible behaviour of the few spread to or authorities <e> <s> it is that kind of circumstance for which part ii is designed <e> <s> it would be disastrous if we had to come back to parliament for a whole new bill with the time delay that would be involved before we could then take effective action <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear the moans but let me just say that one member alone spoke to one point for no fewer than four and a half hours <e>", "<cs> you will all have your turn my lords in due course <e> <s> i am sure <e> <s> with speakers the list is very impressive <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late the debate has been long and the passions i hope are spent <e>", "<cs> well then my lords they are not spent and we shall see if we can add a few to them <e> <s> my passion certainly is not <e> <s> i have to try to reply as briefly as possible because i suspect that perhaps i know better than most that there is always a moment in time when the talking has to end <e> <s> may i begin by saying that <e>", "<cs> i would think so would i not my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it was indeed very good <e> <s> he said one thing which nobody who has served in local government can deny <e> <s> we all know it and i have been on the receiving end like every one of you who has served in local government <e> <s> you know as well as i do what he said about the ultimate fate of every authority at election time depending upon the national scene <e> <s> it happens again and again <e> <s> you can have the lowest rates in the country you can have the best services but if the fortunes of your party at westminster are such then out you will go despite what you do <e> <s> all those of your lordships who have served in local government know it i certainly do <e>", "<cs> let me make one point clear straight away <e> <s> the purpose of this bill is to protect the ratepayer and it is urgent that we achieve that end <e> <s> high-spending

longer <e> <s> the greas do in fact take into account the extra needs <e> <s> when i say that camden is per cent <e> <s> over grea it is per cent <e> <s> over the higher amount assessed <e>", "<cs> it may assist if i very briefly give an outline of the purpose of clause <e> <s> it provides simply that a designated authoritys powers and duties in respect of the making of a rate or issuing of a precept such as derived from the general rate act are to have effect subject to the provisions of the bill <e> <s> that means that the selected authority cannot rate or precept in excess of the maximum determined by the secretary of state and if it does the rate or precept is invalid <e> <s> the amendments seek to ensure that the secretary of state acts in the legal sense reasonably and does not determine a maximum rate which compels an authority to default on its statutory duties <e>", "<cs> clearly i do not know the percentage of its grea overall that the fire brigade requirement of cleveland takes <e> <s> i am not sure what percentage it is <e> <s> i would have thought that if cleveland was to be a selected authority and i do not know if that is so or not i have not the faintest idea at the moment and that is the truth of it then it would be up to them to come along with a derogation and point this out to the secretary of state <e> <s> there is a vast difference i would have thought in deciding that this was an argument that carried weight in terms if you like of re-determining a new rate level and having the fire brigade assessed in terms of grea solely for that one authority <e> <s> as my noble friend knows these calculations are made in the grants working group of the local authority associations where the cases are argued out by the associations themselves <e> <s> it is often they who have to be convinced <e> <s> they know very well that concessions made to one mean something less for another <e> <s> that is not the same thing at all <e> <s> i am not adjudicating in any way upon clevelands fire brigade or the need for it or not <e> <s> i feel however that we are not talking about the same matter <e>", "<cs> it is not because i do not wish to respond to the noble baroness but i feel that there is nothing that i can add <e> <s> i believe very much that there is great power in the argument that i made <e> <s> well i would would i not <e> <s> the fact is that i just know that the secretary of state could not impose a duty that could clearly be shown in any court to be impossible to achieve <e> <s> for that reason i think that it is not necessary <e>", "<cs> at present clause requires the reports laid before the other place to set out the authorities designated by the report and a statement of the principles in accordance with which the designa-tions have been made <e> <s> the principles used must be common at least to all authorities in the same class and we have said that we would expect the principles usually to be the same for all authorities <e> <s> in those circumstances it is difficult to see what could be put into separate reports which could not be as easily put into one report <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble baroness says <e> <s> it is a proper point <e> <s> my answer is that there has to be opportunity for authorities view to be made known <e> <s> whether that particular route is the best or the only one i do not know <e> <s> let us assume a situation where an authority is designated <e> <s> its first move i would have thought is to consider whether or not it wishes to make a derogation whether it wishes to have its figures redetermined <e> <s> i think that later we have some amendments down which touch on that where we will debate the pluses and the minuses of that <e> <s> on the assumption that the authority does want so to do then it will have the chance when this is debated in parliament <e> <s> first it will have the opportunity as an individual authority to come to the secretary of state and make its views known at first hand its thoughts and its reasons <e> <s> that it will have in depth however long it takes in each case <e>", "<cs> i can only say this <e> <s> would i share the concern of the noble baroness if as i said a moment ago i felt that there would not be opportunity for an authority to make its views known and even to go beyond that if it so desires and make detailed representations <e> <s> the noble baroness knows very well how it all works <e> <s> it is true that often it is the officials who prepare the analyses and so on but the responsbility for reading studying and acting upon them is very much that of ministers <e> <s> then the opportunity is given in another plce for that to be questioned and discussed <e> <s> i understand the concern <e> <s> it is a very proper one <e> <s> i just do not think there will be the problem that noble lords fear <e>", "<cs> i think the point to bear in mind here is that the principles involved are principles which are common to all the authorities <e> <s> we are slightly missing that <e> <s> that takes out a lot of the time <e> <s> i envisage that there will be enough time for each authority to have its representatives in another place speak and say what is to be said <e> <s> i do not mean this being done in the form of a two-hour debate <e> <s> i do not see it like that <e> <s> on the other hand the noble lord lord graham is far more knowledgeable than i am about the proceedings in another place <e> <s> he will know some of the inhibitions of parliamentary time <e> <s> i pay all the more attention to what he says about it <e>", "<cs> when the selections are made clearly the basis of the criteria will have to be spelt out <e> <s> of course it will be it must be <e> <s> then an authority will know exactly on what basis it falls into those categories <e> <s> suspect that the majority of authorities have a good idea now but we do not genuinely know until the final analysis of the figures is available <e> <s> i notice that later we are due to debate the matter of the criteria and the extent to which they should be spelt out we shall be coming to that shortly <e> <s> there is no doubt there can be no question but that when designations are made an authority will have to know why it comes within those categories and then it will have an opportunity to question it <e>", "<cs> of course this is something on which there will be no secret it is something which everyone will have to know <e> <s> that is the basis on which the selections will be made <e>", "<cs> when the decisions are made about the authorities which will come within the designation list some people call it the hit list it will be spelt out why the authorities are so designated <e> <s> there will then be plenty of opportunity for discussion and we shall come to this in more detail in later amendments <e>", "<cs> the procedure will be straight-forward and the proposals for the basis of selection and the powers regarding the basis are contained in the bill <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> the noble lord says that an edict will be sent down <e> <s> any time that a statute gives powers to the secretary of state and he makes an adjudication judgment or whatever one can call it an edict or whatever one wishes but that is what it will be <e> <s> if the noble lord refers to clause and he will see that under those subsections parliament will know of the situation but the extent to which it is subject to debate will i am sure be for parliament to decide <e>", "<cs> i am always willing to win some new friends we need all the friends we can get <e> <s> there is some misunderstanding here <e> <s> clause requires a report to be laid before the house <e> <s> clause requires that report to set out the selection principles <e> <s> when that is set out the formal debating procedure that follows is i presume part of the normal business of another place <e> <s> i am sure the usual methods will be used to query the reports <e> <s> that surely is when the opportunity arises for debate of both the principles and at the same time the individual circumstances of the authority <e>", "<cs> i cannot at this stage indicate a likelihood to accept those at all <e> <s> we should want to debate them in depth as we come to them <e>", "<cs> i did not say that at all <e> <s> this is yet another amendment which we are due to debate as we go along <e> <s> i assure your lordships that very little has been missed <e> <s> everything is down for discussion but it has been decided and i do not question it that they should be individually discussed as amendments on their own <e> <s> that is why we have a slight difficulty in separating one from the other <e> <s> but i have no objection at all to the debates running over into each other <e>", "<cs> as i understand it when the report is laid before another place it will set out the principles which have been specified and the criteria on which selection will be taking place at that time <e> <s> when it is so laid there will then be an opportunity for debate <e> <s> when that takes place authorities will know whether they come within it <e> <s> i do not know what the wording of the report will be but i presume it will set out that by applying those principles certain authorities will be part of it <e> <s> whether or not the report is subject to any formal debating procedure in the commons which is really the point of the question of the noble lord lord stallard is something that one needs to go into more closely <e> <s> i am not in a position at this moment to give as much detail as i might like <e> <s> but i certainly undertake between now and the next stage to go into that closely to notify all your lordships who are concerned on the point and if necessary we can talk about it again <e>", "<cs> i say again that i ought to get more information for your lordships about the details of the form in which a debate will take place <e> <s> at this stage of the proceedings there is ample time for me to do that and i undertake so to do <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his kind words but i would not wish to mislead him or the committee in any way at all <e> <s> what i am saying is that i feel obliged to give greater clarification on this matter than i am able to give at the present time and that i gladly undertake to do <e> <s> but i cannot promise that i shall be moved in any way at all beyond what the bill says at the present time <e> <s> nevertheless this will be open to be brought back again when i have clarified in more detail the formalities the procedures and so on which i feel i ought to do <e>", "<cs> whether the noble baroness is or is not accepting the fact is that i am trying to clarify something which has been called for and i have undertaken so to do <e> <s> but that will in no way affect what the bill set out to do <e> <s> i say again that most of the authorities certainly not all have a jolly good idea and have long had a jolly good idea as to whether or not they are likely to fall within the criteria <e> <s> so it will be no great surprise to them when the time comes <e>", "<cs> first on the point concerning the constitution it was the noble lord lord evans in introducing this amendment who referred to that aspect <e> <s> before i make any further comment i hope noble lords opposite agree that in addition to amendment no <e> <s> we are speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and i was assured they were part of the grouping <e> <s> as to the constitutional point the noble lord spoke of one elected authority overturning the decisions of another elected authority <e> <s> are we to have the whole of the second reading debate again <e> <s> that is probably what we should need for me to answer that point because i simply do not consider it to be a constitutional point at all <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to make one observation <e> <s> the noble lord lord evans persists in bringing in second reading points about the underlying theology of the whole bill <e> <s> if he persists in doing so i cannot let go by some of his observations about the overriding of local autonomy the validity of the local mandate and the breakdown of the constitutional points <e> <s> he must not be allowed to get away with that <e>", "<cs> it is not true <e> <s> i did not interrupt the noble lord and i hope he will not interrupt me from a sedentary position <e> <s> i shall give way if the noble lord wishes to interrupt from a standing position <e>", "<cs> on the point of inconsistency what i said on the previous amendment was that i would undertake as i still intend to do to give clarification <e> <s> that was the term i used and i use it again i shall give clarification as to the procedures as i understand them <e> <s> it would then be open to your lordships to decide what you would wish to do about it at a later stage if that was not satisfactory <e> <s> what i have done in the last debate is perhaps to spell out in more detail some of that but i see no reason why i should not elaborate on it still in communicating with your lordships later on <e> <s> that i undertake still to do <e>", "<cs> this is really a debate that has already taken place today <e> <s> i hope that the amendment can be met by a firm undertaking to the committee from the government <e> <s> we will certainly want authorities to know on what basis they have been designated <e> <s> i assure the committee that when we notify authorities that they have been designated we will include a copy of the report made by the secretary of state and laid before the house of commons <e> <s> subsection requires that the report contains a statement of the principles on which designations are made <e>", "<cs> i do not need any reminding about the seriousness of the financial matters pertaining to local authorities <e> <s> i certainly did not say how simple is the block grant procedure or the gre basis of assessment <e> <s> i said that the multiple regression analysis formula which preceded this was so obscure as to be virtually totally incomprehensible to most people in the business whereas gres are at least something which can be laid out and their basis can be questioned in a way which was never possible previously <e> <s> all the practitioners in local government who come to see me and there are very many all concede that that is so <e> <s> however that is not the point that we are discussing <e>", "<cs> if it would help the noble baroness in an attempt to be helpful only i would gladly reply to the debate which she would have initiated <e>", "<cs> i find this amendment rather partial in what it wants the secretary of state to have to regard <e> <s> there is no suggestion that he might also look at spending on different services relative to those of comparable authorities <e> <s> why for example on the figures does sheffield spend per head on refuse collection when doncaster can do it for and birmingham for per head <e> <s> these are important questions and they arise through this amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may respond first to my noble friend lord ridleys latter point amendment no <e> <s> would remove the benefit of this restriction from all authorities spending more than million <e> <s> effectively this is the same thing because from the latest budget information for there are no authorities which will spend less than million <e>", "<cs> well authorities <e> <s> if as the noble baroness lady fisher said the million cut-off was employed to secure the support of the adc it has been singularly unsuccessful <e> <s> the opposition from that quarter has been as vociferous as that from any other area and we have not finished with it yet i suspect <e> <s> that puts this matter in perspective <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness in this argument misses the whole point that the basis for selection will be on criteria that take into account the gres <e> <s> the gres already themselves are specifically designed to take into account local need <e> <s> for example the borough of hackney has a gre for personal social services of and some pence per head <e> <s> that compares with a national average of and some pence per head almost three times the national average <e> <s> that is the whole object the whole purpose of having gres grant-related expenditure assessment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i have to disappoint my noble friend <e> <s> at least i am being consistent <e> <s> your lordships will have to concede that <e> <s> i accept that from time to time it may very well be necessary to increase the value of the cut-off in the light of changing circumstances <e> <s> we have said this <e> <s> but i cannot accept this specific proposal for two reasons <e> <s> first i cannot accept that the rpi is the appropriate index by which to revalue figures <e> <s> it is no more than an index of the movement in costs experienced by an average family <e> <s> that seems quite inappropriate to local authorities which experience different rates of increase in their costs <e> <s> they are at present broadly in line with the increase in the rpi but that is not always so <e>", "<cs> in that the noble lord is anxious to help the secretary of state may i point out why i am equally anxious to help the local authority associations and my concern for their position in this matter <e> <s> amendment requires the secretary of state to consult with the associations about which of their members should be selected for rate limitation <e> <s> i would have thought that that was an invidious position into which to put the associations <e> <s> i am clear that those issues about which authorities should be selected should be matters for the secretary for state and he should be answerable for those decisions and not be able to shelter behind the statutory involvement of the associations in his decisions <e> <s> i shall fairly point out that in relation to the general scheme under part ii where we would be dealing with the whole of local government we do provide for consultation with the associations both on the introduction of a scheme and on the setting of expenditure levels <e>", "<cs> the issue here is whether the principles underlying designation should be common to all authorities or whether it should be possible as i believe to apply different principles to authorities in different classes <e> <s> ideally we should prefer to use the same principles for all authorities and we shall do so as far as possible but that does not recognise the differences which affect the different classes of authority <e> <s> they perform a different mix of functions <e> <s> their costs may in some circumstances be affected to different extents by changes in pay and prices because of different ratios of manpower to running costs and different pay settlements <e> <s> it could conceivably be necessary to vary the principles between classes in order to arrive at similar treatment overall of the different classes <e>", "<cs> i was trying to move ahead but perhaps i will give a little more detail <e> <s> between and for example we have seen relatively large increases in the planned expenditure on police per cent <e> <s> as a result of our commitment to improve law and order services and a slightly larger increase in the provision for personal social services in response to our ageing population <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble and learned lord feels it necessary to talk about gobbledegook <e> <s> if he does not follow the points that i am making he should as he is doing ask me to clarify them and i shall try to do so <e> <s> i find difficulty in understanding some of the questions that the noble and learned lord puts to me <e> <s> he himself suggested that might be the case <e> <s> we are seeking here to ensure that authorities know the principles or the basis on which they have been designated <e> <s> that is what we are talking about the basis on which they have been designated the criteria if one likes that will apply <e>", "<cs> as we have heard this amendment seeks to extend the degree of formalised consultation with local authorities on rate limitation which the bill requires of the secretary of state <e> <s> he would be obliged to consult individual designated authorities in determining their expenditure levels <e> <s> i should like to make it clear that the government are always willing to discuss with individual local authorities matters of concern including financial issues and there are many important matters where consultation with local authorities through their associations would be both proper and helpful <e> <s> but i do not think this is an appropriate matter for consultation with individual authorities <e> <s> there are three reasons <e>", "<cs> we have a long long way to go through this committee stage <e> <s> i do not want to make long speeches if i can avoid them or to keep coming back to an issue <e> <s> one is tempted to talk of what really are second reading matters <e> <s> i say only this to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway about consultation <e> <s> i think that this point will come up again and again <e> <s> we should bear in mind just what we are talking about <e> <s> we are talking about authorities in this range of possible selection which are spending far far above any other comparable authority <e> <s> no one can even begin to say that they have no idea that they might be concerned <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness lady birk said this amendment is the first of a whole series of amendments all of which seek to provide special arrangements within the rate limitation system for spending by a designated authority on particular types of services <e> <s> specifically amendment no <e> <s> seeks to carry forward into rate limitation the procedures for dealing with exceptional circumstances in the target and holdback system <e> <s> before dealing with the detailed topic within the amendment itself because this is the first of a series of amendments and because i am anxious not to repeat the same thing each time i think that it would be appropriate if i were to say a few words about the basic concept behind all these amendments providing that certain types of expenditure should be protected in some sense from rate limitation <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a brief word about this point <e> <s> my noble friend is very wrong <e> <s> if he is right to talk about the imprecision of grea by itself in relation to its assessment for the rate support grant settlement then he has an argument with which personally i have expressed sympathy <e> <s> but let us remember what we are talking about <e> <s> we are not talking about a difference of per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> more or less as between one authority and another as regards its grea <e> <s> we are talking about authorities whose spending is so far above that of all the other authorities <e> <s> when we talk of excessive spenders we are referring to to authorities <e> <s> how imprecise or how precise does my noble friend want us to be <e> <s> five per cent <e> <s> for these purposes i concede per cent <e> <s> i concede per cent <e> <s> i would concede <e> <s> but how much more <e> <s> we could have per cent <e> <s> we can go on and on <e> <s> we could get into the region of per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> how precise do we need to be <e> <s> indeed that applies only to the greas <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> would he acknowledge that the layfield report came out in and that that was long before there was such a thing as block grant which introduced factors which are set out <e> <s> in those days the criteria involved the multiple regression analysis <e> <s> what applied in was certainly not the same as what applies under the block grant today <e>", "<cs> may i say straight away and the noble lord lord ennals was fair enough in his presentation of this amendment to make the point himself that the government not only have the greatest sympathy with the work of the voluntary sector but in a practical way have done and are doing much to enable it both to function and to grow in many ways <e> <s> i am personally very much concerned with the urban programme <e> <s> i see the programmes of many of the inner city authorities and i have big <e>", "<cs> if you narrow it down to that yes to a point <e> <s> but not the whole thing <e> <s> i would then have to <e>", "<cs> i do not usually hit below the belt but i have to say to the noble lord lord howie of troon that that is part of it because at the end of the day one has to ask what is reasonable <e> <s> everything has to be reasonable <e> <s> how many millions of pounds of ratepayers money is it reasonable to spend on this campaign <e> <s> not or are being spent upon this campaign but millions of pounds <e> <s> everything has to be reasonable <e> <s> i do not happen to consider that that is reasonable but that is only part of the general campaign to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> the noble lord speaks very fairly but he misses the one difference between us <e> <s> i said that we were close to one another in what we are seeking to achieve <e> <s> in that we are not only close we are at one <e> <s> but the basic problem with an amendment of this kind quite apart from the problems associated with its wording is that it misses the underlying point which the government are making <e> <s> the government have said expressly again and again that they cannot tell local authorities what they should spend their money on <e> <s> the decision must be theirs <e> <s> the posters about taking decisions away from local authorities and giving them to whitehall and all the rest of that nonsense are dreadful <e> <s> the fact is that local authorities must have the power to decide what they should spend their money on <e> <s> we cannot direct them to spend it in a way they do not choose <e> <s> that is the nub of the matter <e>", "<cs> may i say at the outset that the government need no strictures at all on their role in connection with or support for voluntary organisations <e> <s> the governments record over the last five years stands so far ahead of anything done previously for voluntary organisations i make that statement categorically that in no way do i feel the need to be defensive quite the opposite <e> <s> i understand when your lordships stand up one by one in connection with a specific organisation with which you may individually be concerned <e> <s> that is quite in order <e> <s> i suspect that one could take every single voluntary service in the country and find someone in this committee or more than one person willing and wanting to speak and say something about the good work that it performs <e> <s> there is no argument about this <e> <s> nor was there any argument when the noble lord lord ennals and myself were discussing an earlier amendment <e> <s> certainly there is no argument with my noble friend lady faithfull <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me i have sat here for three-quarters of an hour and listened to everyone <e> <s> perhaps i might be permitted to finish or perhaps i can give way just before i sit down <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it only shows that one should be careful to allow everyone to speak all the time <e>", "<cs> i give the noble baroness the message for cambridgeshire i say it again that it is not anywhere within striking distance or even for consideration on the figures that it is itself producing <e>", "<cs> i know that the governments initiatives in community care are supported by all sides <e> <s> it is right that we should encourage local authorities to take on responsibility for caring for people whose needs are not best met in the institutions of the health service <e> <s> those institutions provide a valuable and important service but do not suit all needs <e> <s> many people are best cared for out in the community and that is what the initiative care in the community seeks to achieve <e>", "<cs> no i will certainly not do that <e> <s> i simply want to say and i think that this ought to be said before the division takes place that the government have announced that they will exempt jointly financed schemes from the effects of grant holdback increases in expenditure <e> <s> there have also been requests that this disregard be extended to cover projects which had been jointly financed previously but which are per cent <e> <s> local authority funded in <e> <s> those representations are being considered at the present time <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i must point out that we have now been nearly three and a half hours on this bill and this is our fifth amendment <e> <s> we have quite a way to go yet <e>", "<cs> albeit briefly i have to say that i think the case is very powerfully made <e> <s> i for one am a staunch advocate of adult education not least for the reasons that the noble baroness lady seear mentioned and especially at this moment in time <e> <s> as she rightly assumed the problem is and this is not an attempt to be difficult or intransigent that because this service is desirable how does one equate it with some of the other worthy causes albeit voluntary which were mentioned earlier <e> <s> it is like saying how does one equate the need to invest in space travel with investing in medical research <e> <s> it is difficult to do <e> <s> it cannot be said that one object is worthy and the other is not one is needed and one is not needed <e> <s> that is the difficulty <e>", "<cs> but in effect you are because you are deciding on the priority for them <e> <s> they may well decide that it is not a priority at all for them <e>", "<cs> it is not only a question of the cost of running morley college about which clearly i do not know <e> <s> i am not suggesting that morley college does not run its affairs efficiently i do not know <e> <s> if the noble baroness says that it does i accept that unhesitatingly but i presume it comes within an authority <e> <s> is it ilea <e>", "<cs> game set and match <e> <s> it comes within ilea <e> <s> need i say more <e> <s> if there is not an authority which manages its rates affairs better than does ilea then if i had a hat though i do not have one i should eat it <e> <s> there is clearly massive scope for ilea to look after that section if it decides that that is its priority <e>", "<cs> the fact is that it is not possible to exempt from rate limitation any specific element of spending <e> <s> the rate limit must cover all the authorities spending otherwise there would not be enough rate income to cover the costs <e> <s> some of your lordships seem to think that the authorities will have two elements to the rates the limited part and the unlimited part <e> <s> it is fundamental to the bill that there will be only one overall rate limit and the priorities for spending within that limit will be for the authority to decide <e> <s> i have said this again and again <e> <s> as regards the person who writes expressing great anxiety sick to death with government cut-backs and so on i do not know what cut-backs he or she is referring to at all <e> <s> if the authority feel that this is something they should support then they will support it <e>", "<cs> there is no question about the government being sympathetic to what is being said here they are very much so <e> <s> may i say at once that we shall always be prepared to look carefully at any case put to us for special treatment for exceptional items of expenditure on law and order <e> <s> for example my right honourable friend the secretary of state has announced that additional expenditure on the costs of policing the current industrial action in the coalfields which actually fell in will be exempted from grant holdback and that he is now considering further representations from the local authorities that such expenditure in should also be exempted and <e>", "<cs> faced with such an array of eloquence my task is not easy <e> <s> the noble lords lord hooson was kind enough to say that the government have been very supportive <e> <s> certainly we feel this to be the case and i am personally a very strong advocate of a language which if i may be allowed to say so happens to be a particularly beautiful language <e> <s> we have no wish to do or see anything that would have any adverse impact on the teaching of it <e> <s> i make that point unreservedly <e> <s> noble lords who have presented this argument very fairly will i hope equally fairly allow me to make the points that i wish and will then come to their own conclusions on the actual issue <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will do that with equal fairness and will understand the reasons for the line that i take <e> <s> i shall take a few moments extra to put my argument because i think that i should <e>", "<cs> my information is that there are welsh authorities and that will be excluded <e> <s> as my noble friend raises that question i shall of course check it out carefully <e> <s> i am not in the business of giving wrong information willingly or unwillingly <e> <s> it might well be the districts that this applies to <e>", "<cs> in the intervening moments i have checked and found that i was correct <e> <s> as i think your lordships know the exclusion is either million or the below-gre exemption <e> <s> it is on that basis that out of the authorities are excluded automatically <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> seeks to extend the degree of consultation with the local authority associations <e> <s> it would require the secretary of state to consult the associations before determining the principles upon which their expenditure level will be set <e> <s> this amendment is very similar to amendment no <e> <s> which proposed consultation with individual authorities but it also raises other objections <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can help on this at all <e> <s> as i have said it is a question of decision <e> <s> as i said many times when we discussed earlier amendments there are no secrets about the criteria generally <e> <s> my right honourable friend in another place spelt out at considerable length the types of factors that will be taken into account in determining the principles <e> <s> we have spoken about it again today <e> <s> what we have now to be resolved are the final determinations based upon the budget <e> <s> once those are made i am quite sure that not only will the authorities themselves wish to make observations but the associations will probably also want to comment <e> <s> as i have emphasised as strongly as i can the door is most certainly open at any time for individuals or associations to come and talk to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i wish the noble lord had not talked about blind loyalty <e> <s> when i think over the -plus amendments to which i have spoken in the last five years it is five years next week and i think of the occasions on which noble lords opposite have trooped into the division lobbies against me and when i compare that to how many times some of my noble friends behind me have deserted me on many occasions i am bound to say that i really do not think we can talk of blind loyalty <e> <s> loyalty certainly but blind certainly not <e> <s> that i am sure is as it should be <e> <s> the noble lord also asked me to treat this chamber seriously <e> <s> i always treat this chamber seriously and i do not think anyone would say otherwise <e>", "<cs> there is no question of the secretary of state picking off anyone at all <e> <s> there is no great secret about this matter <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state referred time and again when these debates were held in another place that the kind of criteria will be the spending against gre and spending against target permutations on these things yet finally to be decided in the light of budget <e> <s> there is no great mystery <e>", "<cs> the first part of the amendment is inconsistent with the purpose of this subsection because it tries to bring local circumstances into the reckoning when the bill provides for all designated authorities to be treated similarly <e> <s> if there are special local circumstances which mean that an authority is not able to meet an expenditure level derived from principles which are reasonable in the case of comparable authorities then the bill provides for the special procedure for a redetermination of its expenditure level <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to remind the committee of the purpose of clause to which this amendment relates <e> <s> it provides that the power to determine a level for total expenditure from which a rate limit will later be calculated must be exercised according to principles determined by the secretary of state <e> <s> in the case of an authority falling within one of the classes which are set out in clause those principles are to be the same for all authorities falling within their class <e>", "<cs> we accept that authorities need a reasonable amount of time to prepare an application for a redetermination <e> <s> we shall see that they are given good time to do this if they think that an application is necessary <e> <s> but the committee will i think realise that authorities will need adequate time to present and discuss their case with the secretary of state <e> <s> the statutory three-month minimum proposed by the amendment is i think too long a period as a minimum <e> <s> we expect that we would normally notify expenditure levels around the end of july at much the same time as provisional expenditure targets for the coming year are announced <e> <s> the annual rsg settlement normally takes place in mid-december as the noble lords will know <e> <s> we would want to have discussions on expenditure levels largely settled by then <e> <s> between those two events there is a gap of four and a half months in which discussions can take place <e> <s> it seems over-balanced to allow two-thirds of the available time to elapse before authorities must even declare their intention to apply <e>", "<cs> i would invite your lordships to take a careful look at this proposition <e> <s> we are setting up a procedure in clause to allow us to take account of the particular circumstances of a local authority if and only if the authority chooses to put those <e>", "<cs> this amendment would require the secretary of state when redetermining an expenditure level at a higher level to lay a report before parliament stating his reasons <e> <s> a determination at a higher level is of course in the authoritys favour and has followed discussion with the authority <e> <s> the finally determined level is however only a stepping stone <e> <s> it will be translated into a rate limit following the rsg settlement and that limit if it is not agreed to by the authority will be submitted for debate and approval by the other place <e> <s> so under the bill as drafted there is an opportunity for the house to discuss in effect the redetermined expenditure level <e>", "<cs> this subsection provides for cases where an authority in seeking a redetermination of its expenditure level produces evidence of local circumstances which prevented it making quickly enough all the necessary economies to meet the level <e> <s> the secretary of state if he was satisfied by the arguments could then decide to redetermine the authoritys expenditure level at a higher amount <e> <s> subsection allows him in doing so to impose requirements on the authority and call for reports on the extent to which the authority has complied with them <e>", "<cs> there is something of a gap in the provision of the bill at this point <e> <s> i think that my noble friend accepts that it would be the governments intention to inform an authority of the outcome of an application for a redetermination and of any require-ments imposed on it if its expenditure level were increased <e> <s> i must say that this has a ring of common sense about it <e> <s> it is right that we should remove any uncertainty on this point by placing a duty on the secretary of state to inform an authority formally of his decisions <e> <s> the amendment will establish a clear end point to the procedure by which an authority may apply and have its expenditure level redetermined <e> <s> it will also ensure that where an authority is to have a requirement placed on it it will receive a clear written notice of what is required <e> <s> this is a useful amendment and i gladly accept it on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> it may help if i briefly explain the way in which we envisage that clause will operate <e> <s> for all authorities the rate or precept income they require is determined by their total expenditure for the year less any block grant payable and adjusted by net contributions to or from internal funds <e> <s> in addition authorities in london may have to provide for payments into or out of the london rate equalisation scheme <e> <s> in setting a maximum we shall have to follow the logic of that relationship <e>", "<cs> the scenario the noble lord describes pertains only where you have elections every four years <e> <s> if one worked in a climate where one had elections every year there would be no such thing as building up balances <e> <s> one would be on parade every single year and there would be great merit in that <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble baroness lady birk for her concern at my being on my own <e> <s> first it is not for the first time secondly i have tremendous support in spirit but even more important in the division lobbies where it matters most when the chips are down <e> <s> what better can one ask than to have support there <e> <s> i should have thought that that is where it really counts <e> <s> nevertheless i am still grateful to the noble baroness for the spirit in which she made her remarks at least as i intend to interpret them <e>", "<cs> when responding earlier to cover the points raised by the noble baroness lady stedman perhaps i should have covered this <e> <s> the reason i did not do so was because she was touching upon amendment no <e> <s> and i hoped she would forgive me if i did not touch on this point <e> <s> my noble friend lord ridley picks up one of the points that the noble baroness covered namely how long would one have to go before one knew that the selective scheme was not working <e> <s> i said repeatedly in previous discussions on earlier amendments regarding some of the spending of the highest overspenders and remember i quoted it as being as high as or per cent <e> <s> and more above gre that it would not be practicable to expect that that could be reduced in one year <e> <s> it just could not be done because then you would have to face a situation in which an authority was being asked to do something which it was impossible for it to do in one period <e>", "<cs> i said and i should like to stick to it that as there are many amendments to follow even on clause and even on the question whether the clause shall stand part of the bill we may have debate <e> <s> i should prefer to leave my reply until that moment especially as my noble friend very fairly said in opening that he was moving a probing amendment <e> <s> he has probed successfully i would have thought so far <e> <s> perhaps we might leave the matter now and come to it a little later on <e>", "<cs> lewisham <e>", "<cs> it is interesting that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has moved away from enfield <e> <s> it has been enfield and hackney up until now and now it is lewisham <e> <s> i have no complaint about that <e> <s> i am just glad to see the versatility of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e>", "<cs> before touching on the amendment i am seeking to avoid the debate which i still think we are going to have on clause <e> <s> if i can first of all pick up one or two of the points that my noble friend has made he said that local government finance should be reformed and quickly <e> <s> he knows that the one thing you cannot do if it is to be done properly is to do it quickly <e> <s> it has been attempts to do things quickly which has led us into the situation that we are in today <e> <s> we had a very lengthy debate on this and i am going to try not to get into it again now <e> <s> but the one thing you cannot have is the kind of reform which i know my noble friend and others want quickly <e> <s> that is part of the problem <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down <e>", "<cs> we are still in committee so far as i know and it is still permissible for me to say something even after the noble baroness has sat down <e> <s> i think that i must just make it quite clear as i said before that we are talking here about a hypothetical situation <e> <s> that is what we are saying <e> <s> i really do not at all follow the noble baronesss recently expressed new concern bearing in mind what i have said <e> <s> when we spoke earlier about amendments nos <e> <s> and i made it quite clear that the whole matter of the selected criteria was one thing but here we are talking about the totality which is something quite different <e> <s> i certainly did not imply that this was a triggering-off figure far from it <e>", "<cs> there is an existing procedure of the other place for referring a bill to a select committee for it to receive evidence and representations on the policy of the bill <e> <s> but there is no such procedure for referring orders to select committees for consideration in the way proposed <e> <s> there are existing procedures for orders to be considered in some circumstances by a select committee <e> <s> for example the joint committee on statutory instruments sees all orders in draft to decide whether they have been <e>", "<cs> the point is that it would not be a procedure for your lordships house it would have to be a joint procedure <e> <s> the amendment so states <e> <s> however even if it were to be a procedure only for your lordships house i would still use the same argument that the proposed procedure is unprece-dented <e> <s> that does not mean that nothing should ever be done because it is unprecedented but it is a fair point for me to make <e>", "<cs> we had a similar discussion in committee about the powers in relation to part i on that occasion the committee accepted our view that the provision for annual renewal of powers was more appropriate to emergency legislation which might be expected to lapse quickly or to be replaced by more permanent provisions <e> <s> that has been the pattern with legislation like the prevention of terrorism act or the legislation in the wake of udi in southern rhodesia <e>", "<cs> it is obviously important and i welcome the opportunity to spell out in more detail than i was able to do on second reading the governments approach to the general scheme for rate limitation and to explain why it is in the bill <e> <s> let me make one thing clear straight away <e> <s> although it has been said again and again i think it is important to say once more that the firm wish of the government is that the general powers in part ii will never be needed and that they are there as reserve powers <e> <s> they will be used only if it becomes absolutely necessary to do so <e> <s> the government hope and believe that the combina-tion of the various pressures on local authorities selective rate limitation the pressures of the block grant system the system of targets and hold-back will ensure that expenditure and rates are kept at reasonable levels and that the governments overall economic policies are not jeopardised <e>", "<cs> if i may take the last point first which is too often the most convenient thing to do the noble lord is quite right when he says that we are talking about a situation which may never arise anyway and <e>", "<cs> the government recognise the case of the responsible authorities and have provided for that in the amendment we passed a few moments ago <e> <s> the first part of this amendment seeks a similar end but in my view it is not operable <e> <s> i cannot see how a secretary of state could ever establish whether an authority had used its best endeavours to reduce its spending to the target gre level <e> <s> moreover the amendment as drafted seeks no evidence of a record of responsible behaviour <e> <s> the governments approach is therefore preferable and i would not wish to support the first part of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish noble lords opposite would not keep saying that it is the civil servants who decide <e> <s> the civil servants could decide <e> <s> i was told before i arrived in your lordships house and in government that this is exactly what would happen <e> <s> all i can say is that this is not my experience <e> <s> yes <e> <s> minister does have certain connotations but not serious ones <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is very far-seeing <e> <s> in those circumstances without going into detail unless the noble baroness wants me to do so in which case i gladly shall may i say that we feel that we are unable to accept the amendment <e> <s> in the other place an amendment in these terms was rejected <e> <s> i believe that it would be unwise to challenge the traditional division of responsibilities between the two houses by passing this amendment <e> <s> i am pleased that the noble baroness said what she did <e>", "<cs> when we discussed amendment no <e> <s> i reminded the committee that we argued in the context of clause that the interim rate limit would be a very exceptional procedure quickly leading to a final limit but provided so that an authority was enabled to make a rate or issue a precept while discussions with the secretary of state were being concluded <e> <s> it will also be noted that under the selective scheme parliament has been made aware of the designation of a particular <e>", "<cs> this is a very fundamental point which the noble baroness mentions it is one we have <e>", "<cs> i assume the noble baroness is also covering amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> would end targets if general rate limitation were ever brought into effect <e> <s> in fact i touched on this a short while ago <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would end targets as soon as the whole bill came into effect <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is consequential and would change the long title of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for putting that the way he did <e> <s> certainly his last sentence was very apt <e> <s> as we move on i am finding it harder and harder to say something that has not already been said <e> <s> i fear that i cannot help my noble friend <e> <s> we could certainly debate this question at length but i am unable to help him in this matter <e>", "<cs> i thought i actually touched on that a few moments ago because i accept without question <e>", "<cs> i recognise the problem that large composite orders could raise under a general scheme <e> <s> to those who are doubtful about whether composite orders can be adequately discussed from the individual authoritys point of view i would cite the example of the rate support grant report <e> <s> that covers all english local authorities and its subject matter is of fundamental importance <e> <s> yet i can assure the committee and i know the noble baroness needs no assurance on this because she has worked within the system that the views of individual parts of the country come through loud and clear <e> <s> certainly cambridges never ceases to come through <e> <s> no voices are strangled or gagged <e> <s> the government have to take note of individual views as well as the collective feeling of the house <e>", "<cs> each of the separate figures has a different purpose <e> <s> there could be good reasons for determining them in different ways <e> <s> it would not be surprising therefore if all the numbers differed in the end <e> <s> gre is a yardstick for use in the distribution of block grant <e> <s> it is an assessment of the cost to an authority of providing in its area services to a typical standard in the light of its statutory functions and its objectively recorded circumstances <e> <s> it is these attributes of the gre that we have argued also make it suitable as a yardstick of higher levels of spending in relation to local need <e> <s> it is not the only one but it is a yardstick <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend is not coming up for the third time <e> <s> i should hate to lose him as he is one of my most avid and regular supporters <e> <s> my noble friend and the cbi know well that the government agree when they say that industry and commerce need some respite from the mounting rate burden <e> <s> this is a major reason why we have introduced the bill <e> <s> however we must be sure that any help we provide for industry and commerce is well directed in order to have maximum effect <e>", "<cs> may i just say a brief few words to thank my noble friend for his intervention <e> <s> on this amendment i fear that i cannot go any further than i have said <e> <s> in a few moments we shall be coming to one or two other amendments where possibly i might be able to be somewhat more forthcoming but on this amendment we have to stay where we are <e>", "<cs> i always respond <e> <s> i think this is really where i came in at the very first debate on the very first issue of this whole matter <e> <s> i would only repeat what i said then that of course nothing is forever <e> <s> it was my noble friend lord sandford i think who moved the original amendment with my noble friend lady birk as i recall as to where do we all go in the future <e> <s> i say again as i said then that the legislation here has to be in place to tackle the immediate problems with which we are faced plus other legislation which will shortly be coming here <e> <s> when all that is in place and working then it may very well be that there will be a moment when a wider look is called for <e> <s> but i do feel that i would have to agree here with the noble baroness lady birk that to do something on its own is not it would only exacerbate problems <e> <s> if anything is to be done it has to be something else way beyond that <e> <s> but right now we have got immediate problems to deal with and that is what we are doing now <e>", "<cs> i do not see why there should be any additional cost <e> <s> the rate demand note goes out now it will merely be a matter of what goes on to it <e> <s> what we seek is that there should be a clear exposition of each of the rating or precepting authorities charge set forth in such a manner as i am sure will be mutually agreed with the associations <e> <s> i do not think that there is any real difference here at all <e> <s> there are many areas where there is a difference but i do not think that this is one of them <e> <s> the actual form and layout will be decided jointly by consultation <e> <s> in terms of the cost i do not see why there need be any addition at all <e>", "<cs> the government are very conscious of the problems that empty property rates can cause and which my noble friend has elucidated <e> <s> i can say from my own experience that in leeds we never ever rated any empty properties and nor do they do so today so far as i am aware <e>", "<cs> whether we do it in the form of two separate amendments which is what i believe at the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first explain why the government recommended the commons to disagree with the original amendment <e> <s> the purpose of clause of the bill is to extend the right to buy to tenants who would have the right under the act but for the fact that their landlord has a leasehold rather than a freehold interest in the land on which the house or flat is built <e> <s> time and the technicalities associated with leasehold tenure prevented provisions of this kind being included in the act <e> <s> we therefore included in our manifesto for the election a firm pledge to extend the right to buy to tenants in cases where the landlord does not own the freehold <e>", "<cs> my lords may i come to that when i have answered the noble lord lord coleraine <e> <s> my <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that <e> <s> as i said this is a difficult and complicated matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> i did not ask why the universities were privileged i simply stated the fact that in the act they have what is a unique right to them <e> <s> i am not questioning whether that right should or should not have been given in i am saying that it exists that it has been practised and that it has worked entirely to their advantage <e> <s> i am not suggesting that that is wrong in any way at all <e>", "<cs> my lords while discussing amendments nos <e> <s> to i should also like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house doth not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed and doth agree to the commons amendment no <e> <s> to the words so restored to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to to the lords amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin with a few observations on what the noble baroness lady denington said because her remarks went right across the spectrum of the whole housing situation <e> <s> exactly years ago i was saying that as regards all the public housing that was being built the priority should be one and two bedroomed units of accommo-dation <e> <s> that is still the position today <e> <s> but one and two bedroomed units of accommodation are also those which are in the greatest demand by young people as well as elderly people <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case the noble baroness will have to explain to us what was special about those houses that meant that they could not be used by young people as well <e> <s> the fact is that what we are really talking about is one and two bedroomed units of accommodation <e> <s> if the noble baroness does not agree with me then we will agree to disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of making a financial windfall <e> <s> prohibitions exist and there are pre-emption rights that go with them so i see no case for saying that there will be windfalls <e> <s> this is an attempt by the government to meet concerns which have been expressed <e> <s> we have done what i think your lordships would fairly expect us to do we have moved and we have made concessions <e> <s> we come back in that spirit and we find before us an amendment which takes us still further away and which will take away from people rights that they now have <e> <s> it is because of that more than almost anything else that think i am entitled to say that your lordships should not accept this amendment <e> <s> it does not have the effect that we have been told it does not mean that if one sells a dwelling to an elderly person the availability of that dwelling being used and occupied by elderly people is lost for ever <e> <s> it does not apply to the other people who buy under the right to buy procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords that is assuming that the person buys it and immediately re-sells it <e> <s> first he has to wait for several years and then the authority still has the right to buy it back if it so chooses <e> <s> so do not let us talk about the windfall profits of these people it just does not apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that i am in total agreement with my noble friend on this point <e> <s> i want to see more dwellings of one and two bedrooms built for elderly people <e> <s> they are being built <e> <s> the noble baroness lady denington was fair enough to acknowledge that fact earlier on <e> <s> that building must continue <e> <s> but what we propose will not disadvantage those people in any way <e> <s> it will give the elderly people rights and i am passionate for them to have those rights and not to be disadvantaged just because they are elderly <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons amendments nos <e> <s> and to the lords amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords

"<cs> my lords i recognise that this amendment responds to the criticisms which i made at the committee stage of the proposal routinely to increase the amount which authorities must spend in order to be eligible for selection by reference to the retail price index <e> <s> we have not disguised the fact that the proposal to exclude small authorities has been based on the desire to avoid the considerable effort required to rate limit a large number of authorities whose spending does not significantly contribute to the problem of overspending <e> <s> we have provided for the cut-off level to be increased and we have accepted that it would be necessary from time to time to uprate the million figure <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will remember that these amendments were considered at the end of the first day in committee when the noble lord lord graham withdrew them and promised to come back at a later stage which he now does <e> <s> both he and the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey spoke forcibly on the amendments <e> <s> however if my reading of <e>", "<cs> my lords i would advise the noble lord to study carefully the whole of what i said when talking about principles because whether he considers it an extraordinary statement or not in the context of what i said it makes very good sense and perhaps he will have a better appreciation of that when he reads the whole of what i have said <e> <s> i am the first to acknowledge that it is not easy to take on board it is not easy and i would say that to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i too begin by saying that of course the government support the work done by voluntary bodies <e> <s> i think that we show that in a very practical way <e> <s> we fund a large number of voluntary bodies to the extent of million a year <e> <s> there can be no question about it <e> <s> the amount of government funding has shown the great not willingness but wish that we have for them to continue to extend their activities <e> <s> but it cannot in any logic be said that all voluntary organisations are equally worthy <e> <s> we have to consider the kind of voluntary organisations that we are talking about <e> <s> my noble friend lady faithfull talked of the registered charities <e> <s> so far as this bill is concerned i think that that is a category about which we have to think carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that it is a different case <e> <s> i do not agree that it is a more powerful one quite the opposite <e> <s> i happen to know a great deal about the urban programme <e> <s> it is one of my departmental functions <e> <s> i respectfully suggest that i have been more involved in the past five years with individual schemes of the voluntary sector than most people one might meet walking around the streets if i may put it that way <e> <s> i had anticipated that once i had indicated a willingness to consider further the concerns of my noble friend lady faithfull about support for registered charities that i should immediately be pressed to look at other cases <e> <s> this is one of four areas due for discussion on amendments today <e> <s> one we have dealt with <e> <s> another is mencap which is an amendment to be moved by the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords first i ought to put one or two matters straight but before doing so i certainly take the point made by the noble lord lord hunt when he objected to my having referred to this amendment and enveloping it with the others <e> <s> i certainly apologise <e> <s> i think that everyone would agree that the four amendments cover the same general ground <e> <s> my enthusiasm carried me away <e> <s> certainly the noble lords point is valid and i accept it and i apologise unreservedly to him <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the very point to which i was about to come <e> <s> this is a matter which is very much misunderstood <e> <s> the fact is that in this case a local authority cannot unilaterally decide to cut the probation service budget <e> <s> it cannot do that <e> <s> the budget is a matter for the local authority to agree with the probation committee which is a statutory committee of magistrates and the authority may only appeal to the home secretary if it is then dissatisfied with the decision <e> <s> this is one particular area that falls almost outside all that we are talking about <e> <s> it is only inside it to the extent of per cent <e> <s> but as i have been reminded it is a fact that a local authority cannot act unilaterally in that way even as regards the per cent <e> <s> of spending <e> <s> i wonder whether your lordships know that that is so because all else apart it is very relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house and we must remind ourselves that we are on report stage in fact that will not need to be a concern <e> <s> we shall come to that when we debate the paving bill but the same funds and grants which would at present go to the metropolitan counties for the provisions of services at that time will go to the district authorities who will then have the same ability to decide whether that is what they want to decide as a priority <e> <s> but i would come back in the case of the probation service to the point i made a moment ago that in this one particular function the authority is not entirely as free as some might think it ought to be <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is very similar to amendment no <e> <s> which was negatived in committee <e> <s> the only change that has been made is that the amendment no longer requires the approval of this house to the principles on which expenditure levels are set but only the approval of the other place <e> <s> it would have been objectionable to involve this house in matters which are the privilege of another place but that was not the main ground on which i opposed the earlier amendment in committee <e> <s> there were other reasons <e> <s> one was practical the other a matter of principle <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i said earlier what we proposed about this amendment and the one which my noble friend lady faithfull mentioned <e> <s> in making the point that the noble lord lord kilmarnock does i have to say that it is not so much for this amendment as for the underlying theology of what we are talking about that i still believe firmly that the opportunities that will exist for authorities who will be selected by definition will be greater than for other authorities to enable them not to have to say that they cannot afford to spend money on some of these so worthwile functions which in no way do i belittle <e> <s> quite the contrary i help to work within them so i would hardly do that <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house my difficulty with what my noble friend lord broxbourne has said is that i am thinking along rather different lines <e> <s> i am thinking more to the principles concerned in this particular category of services <e> <s> registered charities is the area of which we are thinking <e> <s> at the end of the day we still do not want to be in the business of deciding what specific services should or should not be favoured if that is the right word which i suspect it is not but we want rather to look at it on a broader front <e> <s> that is why if i am slightly hesitant my noble friend will bear with me <e> <s> but i think that this is the proper way to do what we have in mind if it meets the bill and if i am able to do it and i cannot guarantee that i am <e> <s> but we shall try <e> <s> i am sorry to be so vague on this <e> <s> it is because we are in an area of some uncertainty <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to say too much on this although if the noble lord lord graham of edmonton wishes to go into it deeply i will have to do so <e> <s> we have been over this argument several times before <e> <s> it is our intention to operate so far as possible on generally applicable principles but the secretary of state we believe should not be restricted in that way and the fact is that we could need a power to operate on principles applying to classes of authorities so that we can treat all authorities fairly and equally <e> <s> that is really what we are all about in this <e> <s> i believe that the amendment is founded on a fear which i believe is a misplaced fear that we wish to treat some authorities unfairly <e> <s> that just is not the case <e> <s> what we wish to do is to be able to take account of all the factors involved which i will elaborate upon if your lordships feel i ought to do so and it is for this reason that the noble lord lord graham predicted when moving the amendment that we should be unable to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> seeks to remove the power to set a smaller expenditure level if after considering the case made by an authority for a redetermination it seems possible to identify additional savings <e> <s> this amendment was moved and withdrawn in committee by the noble baroness lady nicol <e> <s> following our brief debate i wrote to the noble baroness and tried to explain in more detail why we could not accept it <e> <s> it may help the house if i briefly set out the reasons i gave which are still valid <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness so rightly said we are going over ground that we have covered before <e> <s> the main point of this amendment once again is parliamentary involvement in the rate limitation procedures and we certainly talked about it in committee <e> <s> however i remain of the view that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not cover that point when i responded <e> <s> of course i shall consider what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i doubt very much whether it basically changes anything but of course i would want to consider this <e> <s> i did not cover it when i responded <e>", "<cs> my lords this is indeed a narrow and modest amendment <e> <s> we touched upon it during the committee stage <e> <s> i shall explain why we feel that it is not necessary <e> <s> for all authorities the rate or precept income which they require is determined by their total expenditure for the year less any block grant payable and is adjusted by net contributions to or from internal funds <e> <s> in addition authorities in london may have to provide for payments into or out of the london rate equalisation scheme <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house yes my lords <e> <s> the noble lord is of course right that the rate of inflation can change <e> <s> it can go down as well as go up <e> <s> i have served in situations where settlements have been made on one basis i hope in good faith and the rate of inflation has gone up <e> <s> but recently we have happily been in a situation where the rate of inflation has gone down <e> <s> however the government have not turned round and said that they want something back because the position has improved <e> <s> i understand what the noble lord has said <e> <s> it would be astonishing if the rate of inflation were not to change at all <e> <s> however that does not alter the basic point that a reasonable figure has to be struck <e> <s> as long as that is done i believe that it works <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to recognise that we are speaking here of cash planning <e> <s> we are setting out in cash terms what the country can afford <e> <s> it cannot be adjusted for subsequent inflation <e> <s> it is the same basis as that on which we operate targets when we are dealing with that aspect of local government finance <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk is right when she says that it is a very narrow point <e> <s> i shall read <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would specifically limit an order to one authority only <e> <s> i recognise the argument that the disagreed rate limit order is the point in the procedure at which parliament will have their principal opportunity to scruitinise the governments proposals <e> <s> but i believe that this can be done adequately within a composite order procedure <e> <s> although the secretary of state will be looking at authorities individual circumstances in considering applications for derogations he will nevertheless have to take all his decisions on a basis that is generally consistent for all authorities <e> <s> if two authorities had the same individual circumstances in some particular respect the secretary of state could hardly allow for that circumstance in different ways <e>", "<cs> in that case my lords the noble baroness was not making the point i suggested i accept that <e> <s> in any case i am not convinced that a composite order procedure under clause would prevent proper discussion <e> <s> that is certainly not the experience with the rate support grant report debates in another place <e> <s> they cover a far larger number of authorities than the to authorities which could at most be involved under the selective scheme <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i begin by responding to my noble friend lord ridley on the latter point that he makes <e> <s> i am glad to have the opportunity of saying exactly what happened over the question of consultation <e> <s> the government have always been extremely anxious to proceed in respect of its local government policies in consultation with local government and with the local authority associations <e> <s> that is usually what that means <e> <s> to that end i wrote to each of the associations on th september offering a meeting at official level to discuss without commitment the practical operational implications of our policy proposals on rate limitations <e> <s> this offer of course was against the background that at that time we were in the middle of a large consultation exercise on our rates white paper and we were awaiting the comments of the association on the basic policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not find it contradictory in any way <e> <s> what we have said we have believed and we still believe <e> <s> the general scheme is a deterrent it is a reserve power <e> <s> we do not expect that we would have to invoke it <e> <s> the very fact that it is there in place is as we believe a deterrent <e> <s> we are talking of between to authorities for selection <e> <s> as i said when we were discussing this matter in committee what we cannot preclude is that there are things happening today in local government that have not happened before <e> <s> there are people running authorities on an ever-growing scale and we just do not know what the position will be <e> <s> we firmly believe that the legislation as we are now putting it in place will get us and the authorities concerned and the ratepayers where everyone needs to be <e> <s> that is the hope and we believe the effect <e> <s> without having the deterrent there we feel that it would not be as effective and in the long run therefore would be a disadvantage to local authorities as a whole <e> <s> that is why we cannot accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first respond to my noble friend lord sandford <e> <s> of course i will as always read carefully what he has said <e> <s> however i am bound to say that the reasons which i shall give for being unable to accept this amendment will apply to what he has proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say first that at present we do not envisage a situation in which local authorities might qualify for selective action <e> <s> although i seem to have failed to convince noble lords opposite that that is so i want to repeat that point <e> <s> when we keep speaking of from to local authorities that is exactly what we mean <e> <s> it will not be too long before we are able to show that that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly not the governments intention that prudent authorities with a consistent record of good management in compliance with our spending guidelines should be set a rate limit were a general power of rate limitation ever needed <e> <s> indeed our purpose in amending clause in committee was to provide for the exclusion from the operation of a general rate limitation scheme authorities with an established record of responsible self-restraint <e> <s> we recognise the strength of feeling on this issue both in this house and in another place <e> <s> we have now provided that should general rate limitation ever prove necessary rate limits will not be set for authorities which have not exceeded their gre in each of the previous three years and which are so budgeting again in the year in which the question of exemption falls to be determined or which have budgeted similarly in relation to their expenditure target <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment too is exactly the same as one tabled during committee stage and seeks to introduce further exemptions from the operation of the general scheme <e> <s> obviously the statement i made during the committee stage has not satisfied noble lords opposite <e> <s> the first part of the amendment again seeks to exempt authorities which have tried to meet gre and target in the previous financial year <e> <s> however as your lordships know the government have already amended the bill to exempt authorities with a proven record of responsible spending <e> <s> this is now incorporated in subsections and of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords as i seem to have said time and time again in discussing this bill the circumstances which would lead to an introduction of a general limitation scheme would have to be substantially different from those pertaining today <e> <s> whereas we regard the million exemption limit as appropriate for the purposes of the selective scheme we simply cannot possibly know at this time what might be appropriate as an exemption limit for a general scheme <e> <s> indeed it might not be appropriate to have any exemption along these lines especially since we have already included in subsections and of clause specific exemptions for authorities with a proven record of responsible spending <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that expenditure levels and targets should necessarily be set at the same level <e> <s> they have different purposes and there could be good reasons for determining them in different ways <e> <s> it would not be surprising therefore if the numbers differed in the end <e> <s> i explained these differences in committee when we considered a similar amendment <e> <s> perhaps it would help your lordships if i set out our thinking again in the light of this modified amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seems to re-open the debate which we had earlier on amendment in committee about the provision for parliamentary scrutiny of the process of selection for rate limitation <e> <s> the amendment seeks to prevent part i of the bill coming into effect until the principles on which selections will be made have been approved by both houses of parliament <e> <s> i hope that following certain correspendence i have been having and my earlier remarks your lordships are now clear about what we mean by principles in this context <e> <s> i should like to repeat some of the facts for the record <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave of the house i should like the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley to read carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest to the noble baronesss dissertation and her <e>", "<cs> my lords i was lost in fascination listening to the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> it really is a delight to hear him speak <e> <s> i cannot answer clearly as to what one might do <e> <s> i suspect that having come all this way we could not now decide to put a time limit on the general scheme <e> <s> i am well aware of the concern and the government have spoken again and again and i have done so too of the great reluctance with which we have this in the bill at all <e> <s> but either it is a deterrent or it is not <e> <s> only time will tell how effective is part i of the bill <e> <s> i believe that it will be effective and successful time will tell <e> <s> as to whether or not one does anything else with part ii i am bound to say that although i sympathise very much with the motivations of the noble lord lord henderson of brompton i must question that <e> <s> but i shall think about what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords one can begin to respond to that by asking whats in a name <e> <s> i am bound to say that i am not without some sympathy for what the noble lord lord monson says about this <e> <s> he says the public have not yet been won over <e> <s> i think it would take more than a name to do that <e> <s> what matters is not the name but the outcome and how effective the legislation is <e> <s> that is what will decide at the end of the day whether or not the bill is successful and whether the public are really won over <e> <s> i believe in fact that the bill is very much welcomed by those who actually pay the rates and i have no reason to think otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house the point is that per cent <e> <s> or more of authorities try very hard to keep their rates down to reasonable levels and likewise their spending <e> <s> that is why the thrust of the bill is with the minority of high spenders <e> <s> that is where the emphasis has to lie <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness might well be confused by the fact that the advertising and all the rest that goes with it <e>", "<cs> i am quite prepared to sit down and listen if any of your lordships wish to speak standing up rather than from a sedentary position but in the meantime i think that i might be allowed to present the case which is so overpowering that i can well <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should remind you that in just three years during which prices will have risen by less than per cent <e> <s> the glcs spending has doubled from million to million <e> <s> when the average rate increase in england has been less than per cent <e> <s> the glcs rate has gone up by a staggering per cent <e> <s> but it is quite extraordinary how responsible it can become when its very existence is under threat it seems to have concentrated the mind wonderfully <e> <s> all of the mccs and the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am entitled to present this bill in the way i always have done <e> <s> i see no shortage of speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords all the mccs and the glc as i said before are proposing rate rises this year of under per cent <e> <s> tyne and wear and the west midlands are proposing no increase at all and lo and behold the glc is suddenly able to turn an increase of nearly per cent <e> <s> in to a reduction of / per cent <e> <s> in <e> <s> the case for abolition is overwhelming <e> <s> the noble baroness is concerned that i refer to it now <e> <s> i have not the slightest doubt that most of your lordships who will be speaking will be talking on this same point later <e> <s> i am entitled to introduce the bill and indeed to set the proper background to it because without that a proper understanding would not be there <e>", "<cs> my lords may i finish my sentence <e> <s> we believe that the new unitary authorities will be more economic because they will be closer more responsive and more accountable to those whom they will serve <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> if the noble lord will tell me that no one on his side will refer at all to the background to this bill then i will be impressed by what he has just said <e> <s> we have all been bombarded with estimates of savings <e> <s> is the noble lord suggesting that no one will refer to the issue of savings under this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the th bill that i have had the pleasure of introducing into your lordships house <e> <s> i do not recall that any of them took less than to minutes to introduce <e> <s> this is a very important bill which has great interest for many people <e>", "<cs> my lords i think you would want to have the background <e> <s> first i want to refute strongly the claims that have been made that this bill is in any way unconstitutional <e> <s> i know that much concern has been aroused by its provisions <e> <s> let me make one point clear at the outset <e> <s> we shall not implement the provisions concerning the suspension of elections until the principle of abolition itself has been debated and approved in another place <e> <s> should the main abolition bill subsequently fail to pass into law then this same bill in clause contains a built-in mechanism for restoring the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to all who have contributed to this debate <e> <s> very many points have been raised <e> <s> as usual i hope that your lordships will bear with me if in this second speech i concentrate only on why i cannot accept the reasoned amendment <e> <s> let me restate categorically that our main reason for proposing the abolition of these authorities and i am on record as having said it all along is that they are superfluous <e> <s> my noble friend lord marshall spelt it out clearly enough and i am very grateful to him for the detailed reasons which he gave and which i entirely endorse <e> <s> but for now i want to limit my remarks to the amendment and to the contents of this interim bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in the event may i remind your lordships that the choice was made on the basis of three considerations <e> <s> the first was the role of the transitional councils in their last months <e> <s> as i have already explained this will be a combination of care and maintenance and preparation for hand-over <e> <s> the second here i come back to the terms of the amendment was that the successor authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships want me to sit down i shall do so <e> <s> it is entirely appropriate that the boroughs and districts should provide the members for the transitional councils whose functions they will inherit <e> <s> of course i fully understand the concerns that have been expressed on this matter of the elections <e> <s> as i believe i have shown we have considered these objections with the utmost seriousness <e> <s> i have myself gone back and looked again at the options before us <e> <s> i have once more satisfied myself that in all the circumstances the governments proposals are proper ones <e>", "<cs> no my lords i will not give way <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why in introducing the amendments i asked for the indulgence of the house in the obvious interest of not presuming royal assent but on the basis that the bill had received a third reading and had now been passed <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the public bills office would not have admitted this if there was anything improper <e> <s> i say again that i put the matter to your lordships in what i hope was a proper way <e> <s> it is on that basis that i ask your lordships to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness gives me quite a task <e> <s> i understand that it is all the shire districts in the country apart from <e> <s> as the song says where do i begin <e> <s> i think that is really the point the noble baroness is seeking it is all but <e> <s> if <e>", "<cs> my lords that it not too hard <e> <s> they include authorities such as leicester nottingham dare i say it <e> <s> portsmouth and plymouth <e> <s> it is that kind of authority <e>", "<cs> my lords these two amendments seek to modify the changes we made at report stage of the bill as the noble baroness said <e> <s> at that time we <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i can help <e> <s> i am well aware that throughout the attempts i have made to meet your lordships on this question i have not been able to go as far as has been wished <e> <s> but let me see whether i can develop the points as quickly as i can though at the same time it is important that the record should be complete <e> <s> i take the point made by the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> i know it is the view also of the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> i am grateful for the opportunity to put on record the governments thinking on the implications of this bill for local funding for charities <e> <s> we have discussed the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house and very quickly my noble friend lady faithfull asked whether the department would issue guidelines <e> <s> i should like to look into that to see whether that can be done <e> <s> i should also want to consider the other points that she made <e> <s> i take her point that the staff need to know <e> <s> that is very important <e> <s> perhaps i may respond to her by saying that i should like to take a close look at that matter and of course i shall come back to her on it <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that is absolutely <e> <s> they will be able to bring forward their expenditure on the registered charities when they apply for a redetermination and that will be taken into special consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the argument that the secretary of state should be as accountable as possible for his decisions and we would not want to shirk the responsibility for decisions taken under rate limitations quite the contrary <e> <s> what we are opposed to is the provision of over-elaborate safeguards which we have considered at various stages <e> <s> let us be realistic <e> <s> when an authority has been designated when the secretary of state has prescribed an expenditure level for them and if the authority has applied for a redetermination can we really believe that all this would happen without comment and press coverage <e> <s> certainly it would not happen where i come from i give an absolute <e>", "<cs> my lords before i go any further may i say to my noble friend lord chelwood that a henry viii clause is generally understood to provide a general power by subordinate legislation to amend primary legislation <e> <s> part ii of this bill is not therefore a henry viii clause <e> <s> before i comment specifically on <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are talking on the broader front and it seems as if we are may i just say that we ought to consider how we reached this position in the first place <e> <s> we reached this position because despite the attempts by not just this government but previous governments to exhort local government for years and years to say remember was it crosland <e> <s> the partys over the fact is that current spending in local government has been running out of control quite the opposite to the capital spending side <e> <s> it is a question of what can be afforded and local government simply refused from to do anything about it <e> <s> i am talking not of the majority of people in it quite the contrary <e> <s> i am talking of perhaps per cent <e> <s> but as it happens that per cent <e> <s> are among the largest spenders and the impact of what they do tells for all <e> <s> did we not say many times during the debates we have had that perhaps authorities have accounted for <e>", "<cs> my lords i sit for hours and hours and days and days and virtually never interrupt anyone <e> <s> my fate seems always to be interrupted <e> <s> the fact is that it was not i who started talking about the background to this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord evans of claughton spoke about it <e> <s> i wrote down what he said <e> <s> he talked about the future not being governed by whitehall and about handouts and grants from central government <e> <s> i was doing the very same thing and commenting on that <e> <s> i do not see why i should be taken to task for trying to do that when presenting my reasons for not being able to accept the amendments <e> <s> that is a perfectly proper thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness lady birk will promise not to question my speaking so off the subject i should be very glad to comment on what the noble lord lord pitt has said <e> <s> but first i must have at least a nod of acquiescence from her that <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly i should love to debate this issue but your lordships will expect me to answer some of the other points so i cannot do so tonight <e> <s> i must deal with amendments specifically despite the latitude that the noble baroness gave me <e> <s> these amendments are designed to stretch the benefit of the concessions that we have made <e>", "<cs> my lords this is indeed a question of accountability <e> <s> under the lrt bill my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport is seeking powers to recover from londons ratepayers by means of a levy up to two-thirds of the grant which he will pay each year to lrt to support londons public transport services <e> <s> certainly and i make no hones about it he must be required to account for that levy and there is nothing between us in that respect <e> <s> the question is to whom <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i am in considerable sympathy with the point that has been raised <e> <s> the warehouse industry in particular in circumstances such as those described by the noble lord lord evans has had problems and has been making overtures for a long time <e> <s> the amendment as such is seriously defective because the definition of the property to be covered seems to be likely to be unworkable <e> <s> i could say much more about this but the hour is late <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> it is a controversial measure which has raised strong feelings but i am glad to say that despite the controversy the debates have been very much up to the highest standards of your lordships house <e> <s> perhaps i may say to our opponents that i suppose this is one issue on which we shall certainly have to differ <e> <s> but i beleive that over the next two years the proof of the pudding will be in the eating <e> <s> there is no doubt that a small minority of authorities have oppressed their ratepayers and the object of this bill is to protect them through limiting the rates in regard to that small number <e> <s> i do not want to make a long speech but i think it would be wrong to let the bill leave this house without very briefly saying a word of thanks to my noble friends lord avon and lord skelmersdale for their help in sharing the burden of presenting the bill to your lordships house <e> <s> i have benefited greatly as always from their help and advice <e> <s> perhaps i may also thank noble lords on the front bench opposite who have been fair minded while they have presented their arguments in a telling and eloquent way <e> <s> it would be an understatement to say that this is not the first time i have been opposed by the noble baroness lady birk whose efforts have brought zest enthusiasm and not inconsiderable skill to the presentation of her arguments and one day she will let me conclude mine i am sure <e> <s> nevertheless i am grateful to her <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth not insist on their amendment to the commons amendment no <e> <s> and doth agree with

<e>", "<cs> may i just make a very quick intervention and say on that point of course i shall he speaking later that i am glad to confirm if there should be any doubt that it is the governments intention to accept the amendment relating to the affirmative resolution procedure <e> <s> but i shall refer to it again when i speak a little later on <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones in opening said that he hoped that the debate would not widen too much on aspects other than the specific amendment <e> <s> i think that he would concede that it has done so rather more than he might have hoped <e> <s> i shall endeavour not to take it wider than is strictly necessary <e>", "<cs> it is a different point <e>", "<cs> i assume that we are speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the government cannot accept these amendments <e> <s> we feel that the amendments would confuse the position <e> <s> without going into a great deal of discussion which i shall do if the noble baroness would like me to do so we feel that the arguments and considerations on behalf of these amendments are somewhat academic <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is probably unworkable <e> <s> how can we define when a bill has not received royal assent <e> <s> we could say that the main bill has not received royal assent today <e> <s> we could say that the day the paving bill receives royal assent <e> <s> the main bill has not received royal assent <e> <s> so the day the paving bill receives royal assent is the day that the secretary of state must according to this amendment repeal it <e> <s> even if we are a little more lenient in our interpretation of the amendment it is still not clear as to what stage a bill can be deemed to have failed to receive royal assent <e>", "<cs> perhaps i ought to say a little more about amendment no <e> <s> because there seems to be some confusion as to what it is <e>", "<cs> of course one can always do that although as always i assume through the normal <e>", "<cs> i think it would be helpful both to the noble baroness and to the noble earl if i repeated that what i said on the previous amendment still applies <e> <s> the government feel that the amendment in the <e>", "<cs> as i was trying to indicate a little earlier the government are happy to accept the amendment <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> in that case perhaps the noble baroness may feel able to withdraw the amendment in the knowledge that as i indicated earlier if an explanation is required i shall be glad to make it <e>", "<cs> as i indicated in the debate on the amendment which we were discussing earlier the government fully recognise the concerns which have prompted the two amendments which we are now discussing <e> <s> we accept that both houses should have a further opportunity to debate the cancellation of the elections before a commencement order bringing part ii into operation is made <e> <s> in principle therefore the government are wholly sympathetic to the intention which lies behind both amendments <e> <s> in practice i have to say that the amendment of the noble earl is preferred <e> <s> i am advised that the drafting of the amendment standing in the names of the noble lord lord spens and of the noble earl lord halsbury is the most appropriate means of providing for the commencement order to be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure in both houses <e> <s> if the noble baroness wishes to have a debate on the word that is missing no doubt we can try to do so <e> <s> but that is the advice which i am given and at the end of the day it really makes very little difference <e>", "<cs> we really are making much of this <e> <s> i do not accept that the government did not get it right <e> <s> what the government have done is to accept certain representations made as improving and clarifying and making it easier for your lordships to give consideration to matters <e> <s> that we do accept but that is not to say that what was there before was wrong <e> <s> what we now have is something that we accept is better <e> <s> i always understood that to be the purpose of this as a revising chamber <e> <s> but for the noble lord to say that by accepting amendments that make the bill clearer in whatever way is in some way going back or whatever i think is a very dangerous thing <e>", "<cs> i think the underlying tenor of what the noble lord says is extremely far-reaching <e> <s> i said when speaking earlier that to say that an affirmative resolution procedure is cosmetic as the noble lord himself has just repeated <e> <s> i assume means that he and his colleagues will no longer in the future attach the importance to it that i have attached to it in connection with the bills that i have been debating these last five years <e> <s> time and time again i have either had to resist or agree to that procedure going into legislation and how to be told that it is only cosmetic i think is a very startling observation to be made <e> <s> it is not one to which in the context of this legislation i can give the kind of reply which i think would satisfy the noble lord <e> <s> but perhaps that is something which will be taken up on another occasion outside this chamber <e> <s> certainly his observations merit that and i hope it will happen <e>", "<cs> this new clause appears to be intended to waive the glc and mccs duty to issue a precept sufficient to meet their expenditure for - by th march should an order repealing this bill be made and elections held <e> <s> they will presumably wish to issue a precept after the elections and i am advised that the amendment as drafted could be interpreted to mean that unless elections were held after the making of such an order under the bill there would be no duty on the glc and the mccs to issue a precept at all for <e>", "<cs> let me say how much i welcome the conversion of the noble baroness <e> <s> i remember so well that when we discussed a certain bill and i will look it up in <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness will know whether it is an exaggeration when she receives a letter from me with the quotation <e>", "<cs> as he always does my noble friend makes very well the point that i want to make <e> <s> i am bound to say that i am advised that the new clause as drafted is defective <e> <s> it could well be interpreted as meaning that the government would have to pay for every election to the glc or mccs from the repeal of the bill thereafter no doubt there are some who might find that an attractive prospect but few would argue that it was equitable <e> <s> furthermore it would make the government liable even if the may elections were never suspended by a commencement order and went ahead as normal after the bill was repealed <e>", "<cs> let me say at once that what is proposed is entirely consistent with precedents of earlier reorganisations when by-elections were stopped after royal assent to the reorganisation legislation <e> <s> this amendment seeks to remove by-elections from the provisions suspending elections to the abolition authorities <e> <s> the local government act requires a by-election to be held within six weeks of a vacancy arising except in the six months leading up to the ordinary elections to a council <e> <s> during those six months no by-elections are held except those for vacancies arising before the beginning of the period or if more than one-third of a councils seats are vacant <e> <s> in the normal course of events those circumstances are likely to arise quite rarely <e> <s> one would expect therefore that no by-elections to abolition authorities would be held after early december <e> <s> that seems sensible given the fairly short period of office that would be served by anyone elected at a later by-election <e>", "<cs> the noble lord makes one point to which i feel i currently do not have an adequate answer <e> <s> his point about an extension of time beyond may in certain circumstances seems on the face of it to be something to which i feel my own response is not adequate <e> <s> for the other reasons that i gave earlier i do not like the basic thrust of the amendment as such <e> <s> i just feel that i ought to and would want to give a better answer than i am able to give at the moment <e> <s> i would therefore certainly want to study this and come back on the point later <e> <s> what i will do if the noble lord agrees is to write to him and if i can be satisfied then at least i will explain to him where the government stand and he can then perhaps decide what to do <e> <s> but i do feel that what i have here is not adequate on that very fair point that he makes <e>", "<cs> may i first of all make clear that in addition to amendment no <e> <s> we are speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i am sure my noble friend lord broxbourne is in agreement with that <e>", "<cs> we were bound to move this evening into some areas which would be confusing in terms of what did and did not apply and what is separate from the earlier decison <e> <s> i think that the key words are <e>", "<cs> i have some difficulty with these two amendments <e> <s> my difficulty with the first amendment amendment no <e> <s> a is that i do not see what useful purpose it would serve <e> <s> my difficulty with the second amendment i assume that we are speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> is that i see all too clearly what its purpose is <e> <s> it is one that the government cannot support <e> <s> dealing first with amendment no <e> <s> a i wonder whether it is designed to ensure that membership of transitional councils shall be set out in schedule <e> <s> if that is the case i have to say that it is an unnecessary provision <e> <s> subsection already makes clear that the numbers of members of those councils will be as set out in schedule <e>", "<cs> i explained in some detail exactly why it was that we were proposing this apportionment if that is the right word which it probably is not <e> <s> the fact is that there is a tremendous difference between the electorial situations in the two sets of areas that we are considering namely the glc and the mccs <e> <s> the noble baroness lady lockwood mentioned yorkshire <e> <s> she said that the areas for travelling are wide <e> <s> they are wide but then those who are on the councils will themselves apportion who will do what <e> <s> whatever else may be said anyone who has served on a large council as i have for many years would not say that for example out of the councillors on the authority that i worked with at different times it was and there was not a workload for certain key people <e>", "<cs> i give consideration to everything that is mentioned and raised <e> <s> i think that today after the somewhat traumatic earlier happening it cannot be said all else apart other than that i have been willing to consider to take away to postpone such matters as i thought were proper <e> <s> i am not without sympathy to the underlying theme of what is being said but i feel that the fears that have been expressed will not turn out in practice to be justified <e> <s> i understand why they are expressed <e> <s> the noble baroness in referring to the <e>", "<cs> of all the people who should have been opposing this the noble lord lord evans is one as he made out rightly in his latter remarks <e> <s> his party has probably suffered more on this than most <e> <s> i am frankly amazed at the attitude of noble lords about this <e> <s> here the government set out genuinely to <e>", "<cs> this is not an easy area <e> <s> we have had to think very carefully about this <e> <s> because the authorities concerned deemed that they did not wish to talk they themselves have had no imput into this <e> <s> so they must not complain if they do not like what is finally decided for them because they do not want to have any part in deciding it with anybody else <e> <s> it is not an easy area to try to get right <e> <s> i think that i shall write to the noble lord lord mcintosh on the particular point that he raised <e> <s> we have talked about it but i think i should like to dilate on it and give him a chance to consider what i say <e>", "<cs> it will be the authority the people who will do it <e> <s> i quoted the words of the legislation so far as is practicable <e> <s> if there is a situation such as the noble lord describes the authority themselves will decide how to do it <e> <s> i can think of ways in which i would deal with a situation such as that <e> <s> i would say right we will toss a coin for the spare seat that exists <e> <s> but i suspect that may not be what others would do <e> <s> i shall make one more comment after the noble lord has finished since at the moment i am only intervening <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i shall say anything further because i suspect that when we come to the next amendment when we shall be discussing not totally dissimilar matters although it will not be tonight we shall be going round this track again <e> <s> so maybe i ought to keep some of my powder dry <e> <s> i have a great deal of it mark you but i think i shall keep it dry for that occasion <e>", "<cs> may i put the record straight at once <e> <s> i must tell the noble lord lord evans that i have indeed been a member of a minority in opposition <e> <s> i have been through all the four permutations <e> <s> i have <e>", "<cs> of course i do not accept just about everything the noble baroness has said <e> <s> she it is who refers to gerrymandering of political control of the glc i refuted that before and i refute it totally and absolutely now <e> <s> she says that st april for abolition is now wholly unrealistic <e> <s> not at all <e> <s> the date is st april and subject to the confirmation of parliament in due course that is the date that will be met <e>", "<cs> it is not usual for me to treat your lordships with contempt <e> <s> in fact i think this is the first time i have ever been accused of doing that and it is certainly not something that i do <e> <s> the government are considering carefully how they will respond to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as i said earlier there are a number of options and an announcement will be made as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> i cannot tell the house when but it will be made as soon as possible <e> <s> the governments firm resolve to fulfil our election commitment to abolish these unnecessary and expensive upper-tier councils remains <e>", "<cs> the answer is a bit of both <e> <s> we really are trying to catch up with what goes on in another place <e> <s> the fact is that there will be certain matters raised which have nothing whatsoever to do with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> there will be others where there is a connotation based upon what will be the ultimate decision <e> <s> in responding to amendments that are moved i shall try to point out where it has to be pointed out where there is a difficulty <e> <s> i think that this does not apply to the majority of the amendments before us today and that ought to be made clear so that there is no doubt <e> <s> the majority of the amendments here are not affected by that and therefore it does not apply <e> <s> but where it does i shall do my best to be helpful where i can and point out where there is a difficulty and what are the arguments on the assumption that the bill is as amended <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord alport reminded us on th april the government declared after consultations and discussions that they would prefer to have a directly elected body in regard to ilea <e> <s> the reason for the change was that the weight of informed opinion among those whose views the government respected was overwhelmingly in favour of the change <e> <s> i think that it is probably only fair to say that the government deserve credit for taking the consultation exercise very seriously <e> <s> this was one of a number of changes made as a result of the comments we received <e>", "<cs> i think the first point to make here is that if it was ever necessary to use this power to adjust a quorum it would be only in response to obstruction that would be the only time when it would be necessary <e> <s> the powers which subsections and of clause confer on the secretary of state are a very necessary safeguard <e> <s> i fully expect constituent councils and their members to behave responsibly <e> <s> as i said before if they do there is no need at all for this power ever to be exercised <e>", "<cs> i do not want to go on about this and i have tried not to overstate the case i do not want to reel off a whole series of quotations by people and so on <e> <s> however my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter put the case so rightly <e> <s> the government would be monumentally neglectful if they took no heed at all of all those matters and did not recognise that the statements made are part of an absolute policy to thwart the legislation <e> <s> i shall not say any more because if i do i shall be drawn into the nuts and bolts of the matter and i do not want to do that now certainly in view of what the noble lord lord graham has said about it <e> <s> therefore on this matter we shall have to agree to differ <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> alights on the date of st april as the date by which the whole of part ii of the bill will be brought to an end <e> <s> there is no need for this deadline <e> <s> clause of the bill includes a provision for the repeal of interim measures and the restoration of the original situation should the main bill fail at any stage <e> <s> if the main bill fails after part ii has commenced then part ii will be repealed <e> <s> if abolition goes ahead then the transitional councils in whatever form they may be if they are there will terminate according to the provisions of the main bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter who in his own most effective way said much if not all of what i wanted to say <e> <s> the new clause would serve no useful purpose <e> <s> the government have conducted an extensive consultation exercise on their proposals and there has been wide public discussion of them <e> <s> we have already moved forward from those orginal proposals in the light of consultation and debate but to publish all the views submitted to us last january would be pointless and as my noble friend says an absolute waste of resources <e> <s> that is a consideration that does weigh with some of us <e> <s> we must decide whether such an expensive contribution to historical research would be justifiable <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to frustrate the operation of clause of this bill <e> <s> clause is an integral part of the measures we are taking to pave the way to abolition <e> <s> the principal object of the bill is to allow the successor authorities every opportunity to prepare for their new responsibilities and for a smooth transfer of functions <e> <s> in order to be able to do that they need information and they need it as soon as possible <e> <s> that is why we have included clause in this bill <e> <s> it does not prejudge the main abolition issue at all it prepares for that eventuality <e> <s> it does so by extending existing powers under section of the local government act <e> <s> it is a perfectly reasonable and appropriate paving measure <e>", "<cs> i always listen carefully <e>", "<cs> i listened particularly carefully to the noble lord who as always presents his arguments very clearly <e> <s> it is not at all difficult to follow them <e> <s> clause is vital to ensure that the necessary information is available to assist in formulating and should parliament approve implementing proposals for abolition and for the smooth transfer of functions <e> <s> the clause clarifies and extends the existing information requirements of section of the local government act <e> <s> one way in which clause extends section is that as the noble lord told us it places a duty on officers of the glc and the mccs as well as on the councils themselves to supply information <e> <s> it is that duty which these amendments seek to remove <e>", "<cs> i am pretty sure that there are a great number of precedents of that kind <e> <s> i do not have a list before me but i gladly undertake to send such a list to the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> may i say to my noble friend lady gardner that i saw the letter to which she referred <e> <s> i am bound to say that it was one of the most abusive letters i have ever seen any member of a council write to another member of the same council who had only asked for information <e> <s> all right perhaps that is what one comes to expect these days in certain situations <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> perhaps i ought to have said to the noble viscount to whom i have said i shall write that there is a similar <e>", "<cs> this is something which together we shall clear up for the noble lord outside the committee <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> if one thinks through in depth what we are talking about one sees that really it is all very sad <e> <s> after all all the information we are talking about is information that is there and should be available to everybody to the public <e> <s> in my own time on councils i always had an absolute policy that everyone should have access to everything <e> <s> this is information that is in the public domain <e> <s> if one is an elected member representing people one has to make available information <e> <s> that is not the same as being part of the decision-taking process where one needs to weigh up pros and cons consider alternatives and all the rest of it <e>", "<cs> throughout our debates on this bill i have acknowledged at all times the legitimate interest of your lordships in the financial consequences of our proposals <e> <s> i have made clear that demands for precise and detailed estimates are premature because the fact is that whatever is said or is not said much depends upon the decisions that will be taken by the successor bodies throughout and early <e> <s> the fact is that until the boroughs and districts have access to the detailed information about the existing glc and mcc services and until the planning cycle leading up to begins it will be impossible to make a comprehensive assessment of the financial consequences of abolition <e> <s> although some matters lie within the control of central government it really is the local decisions that matter <e> <s> the government will be able to do no more than report to the house such information as comes to the secretary of state about those decisions <e>", "<cs> we are not talking about enterprise agencies at all <e> <s> we are talking about enterprise boards which are a totally different matter <e> <s> i shall be glad to elaborate later if the noble lord wishes <e>", "<cs> i should begin i believe by making one or two things again clear <e> <s> i should perhaps have made them clear originally <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord lord tordoff raised some points that were particularly irrelevant <e> <s> we are taking action here to control section spending only in not expenditure <e> <s> there may well be expenditure already committed before th june <e> <s> if so this does not apply to any such committed expendiure <e> <s> it is primarily the year that we are talking about <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord says that <e> <s> it gives me the opportunity to confirm that organisations this picks up the point made by the noble lord lord mcintosh with perfectly proper spending have nothing to fear <e> <s> the noble lord asks who decides whether it is perfectly proper spending <e> <s> you have to look at this in the context of abolition <e> <s> your lordships may have noticed that in moving the amendment i deliberately did not refer to a single particular organisation <e> <s> i could have given the list that everybody now has <e> <s> it was put out by various bodies <e> <s> i have literally pages and pages of details of what many would consider weird spending <e> <s> but i deliberately did not give the list because frankly this amendment has nothing to do with the majority of perfectly proper instances of spending on voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that there are many bodies which will be only too anxious many of them as my noble friend lord plummer said at the instigation of the glc and others to do anything they can to make mischief and to go forward in that way <e> <s> may i give your lordships a quotation <e> <s> i have tried not to raise the temperature at all in this debate but let me give your lordships a quotation from what was said in another place <e> <s> mr tony banks the member for newham north-west asked whether the secretary of state had not put his finger on it when he said he suspected that an extended glc would wage war on the government <e> <s> he said that that indeed was what it would do and had been doing <e>", "<cs> save jobs <e> <s> it is part of the employment thing <e> <s> there is no complaint at all about the objectives of enterprise boards <e> <s> i should rather not get into that <e> <s> again if there is anything that is good is achieving things and is worthwhile that is fine they have nothing at all to fear <e> <s> that is my answer to the noble countess lady mar <e> <s> if they are doing a good job they have nothing at all to be concerned about in this <e> <s> we are not interested in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have much sympathy with the question that the noble lord raises <e> <s> the question really is only to what extent and how they should be given that opportunity <e> <s> of course the opportunity exists already <e> <s> it is merely a matter of how far one would want to proceed down the path of legislation and that is something which as i say is an option and must be part of the consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords if i were to answer that it would just be to give some credence to a question which really deserves none <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that i find it astonishing when noble lords express concern about local government and all that goes with it that they should be willing if you like to sustain a view that is totally unprepared to even look to see what others can provide the same level of service for <e> <s> i find that almost impossible to understand <e> <s> it is quite different from saying that you will accept what is there <e> <s> not even to want to look or to know or to ask i find astonishing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord certainly will have to send me the list to which he refers <e> <s> i would ask him at the same time to consider to what extent he knows of the disastrous consequences of services provided by in-house organisations which do not receive the same kind of publicity as may have been received by individual situations of the kind to which he refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope very much that there will be the maximum publicity for what has been achieved by those authorities which have placed services out to the private sector <e> <s> that would be very salutary to note <e> <s> i hope at the same time that authorities will publish the success which they may have had even from going in-house after they have changed the basis upon which they have been working for so many years <e>", "<cs> because i think it is fair to say not that it is a disaster but quite the opposite and that because the private sector has thrown a spotlight upon the opportunities that exist to do things better there are now services being provided all over the country at a fraction of the cost they were provided for for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is referring to the dlo legislation and certainly there is no reason at all why all the information available should not be published <e> <s> so far as i am aware statistics are not kept separately for all that each local authority does by way of contracting out its services though i am told that some information has recently been published by the private sector and the statistics of what has been achieved have been collated <e> <s> so far as i am aware there are no overall statistics available because as the noble lord will agree this is something which applies not just to one department but goes across all departments <e>", "<cs> my lords the information that i have is that which comes within the purview of the department of the environment <e> <s> there we have information which comes to us from the local authorities concerned i point out that it is information that comes from authorities <e> <s> we have not as yet collated it but there is no reason why we should not do so and your lordships should have no doubt that when we do the figures will be seen to be dramatic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to confirm that that is the information i have as well <e> <s> as i said before when taken together with the other information it will only help to make the picture dramatic <e> <s> as a result of this question i shall consider the matter and the possibility of collecting together all the current information to see how it can be better publicised <e>", "<cs> my lords one difficulty is that it is not the refuse disposal department but the refuse collection department <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to say that liverpool was treated no differently from any other authority in england <e> <s> they received no special concessions <e> <s> they received nothing on rate support grant nor on targets nor penalties nor disregard nor <e>", "<cs> my lords i can make no observations at all on the likely rate support grant settlement <e> <s> as to the point about a moratorium i certainly cannot comment on that either but i hope as does the noble lord that that will not come about <e>", "<cs> my lords the truth is that this amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> should the main abolition bill fail the paving provisions will no longer be necessary useful or relevant <e> <s> the government have always recognised that <e> <s> that is why we have given our undertaking about the commencement order why the power to repeal is included why the bill has the short title that it does and why we have all come to call it the paving bill <e> <s> there has never been any question but that should the main abolition bill fail the secretary of state will exercise the power to repeal the paving legislation and restore the status quo as soon as is practicable <e> <s> the amendment is not only unnecessary but i submit also undesirable <e> <s> i recognise that a date st july has been specified in answer to an objection which i put forward to a similar amendment in committee which did not specify a date the objection was that it was unclear at what stage a bill could be deemed to have failed to receive royal assent <e> <s> but by including a specific date we simply run into another objection <e> <s> the amendment now before us would prejudge parliaments consideration of the main bill <e> <s> it sets parliament a deadline for considering a future bill <e> <s> clearly that is not acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> of course a hypothetical situation such as he describes could not be ruled out as impossible <e> <s> however if we are dealing here in terms of likelihood i think not least because of much of what was said and i would refer specifically to what my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said during the earlier debate that in practical terms that really is not a scenario which seriously needs to trouble us <e> <s> what ought to trouble us is the likelihood of the possibility that i have described and the undesirability of fixing a firm date in the way that this amendment does <e> <s> i have no doubt at all that this would create all kinds of problems and the government cannot accept it <e>", "<cs> again by the leave of the house though i am anxious on report not to keep asking for leave may i say that of course i will as i always do read carefully what the noble baroness has said and i will be in communication with her about it <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house let me simply say that in terms of numbers it would frankly depend in each case upon how many people were turning up to ensure that the councils business was being conducted <e> <s> if one is to assume that this is a draconian step which is being taken without any <e>", "<cs> my lords again by leave of the house the noble lord referred to a council not liking what a government are doing <e> <s> this has nothing to do with whether a council likes or does not like what a government are doing <e> <s> this is simply about the conduct of the councils business nothing more nor less than that <e> <s> all that the government are saying is that the council must continue to conduct its business <e> <s> there are many people who have said we have no intention of enabling the council to conduct its business <e> <s> they have not said it in those words but they have said it in so many and i shall give quotations if called to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say first that i would wish that the noble lord lord sefton was as vehement in his expressions of concern about so many things <e> <s> i know that he has these concerns because i too gladly refer to the conversations not that we had but that we still have from time to time about what is happening in local government <e> <s> in response to an earlier amendment i mentioned that we are discussing taking measures that five years ago would have been unthought of and unnecessary <e> <s> there is so much going on in local government today which is anathema to those who are really concerned about the future of local government <e> <s> i shall come to the points that the noble lord made in a moment but that had to be said in the beginning in that the noble lord asked me something specifically referring to my background in local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have begun my response with a quotation which reads as follows <e>", "<cs> sometimes <e>", "<cs> my lords clause is an integral part of the measures we are taking in this bill to pave the way to abolition <e> <s> an important object of the bill is to allow the successor authorities every opportunity to prepare for their new responsibilities and for a smooth transfer of functions <e> <s> in order to be able to do that they need information and they need it as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can add a great deal to what i said in committee <e> <s> we heard the argument that the provision would place officers in an invidious position and that officers would have to choose between obeying the law and obeying their employers <e> <s> but as i said in committee that is not the intention or the effect of the provision <e> <s> on the contrary the duty on officers is a protection for them <e> <s> the officers duty would be clear it would be the same duty as we all share to obey the law <e> <s> if there were a conflict of demands that would be the creation of the employing authority <e> <s> i want to reassure your lordships as i did the committee that if the officer had to provide information despite his authoritys wishes there would be no question of a breach of his contract of employment arising <e> <s> it is an implied term in every contract of service that an employee may not be required to do an unlawful act or to refrain from carrying out a legal duty <e> <s> so officers will not be in <e>", "<cs> by leave of the house my lords certainly this is an area of much sensitivity and i accept that without any question but the problem is that the need for the information is extremely important <e> <s> i think there is a fundamental flaw if i may say so in the analogy between the social worker with his duty to maintain the secret information about an individual and the officer of a local authority with his knowledge of the authoritys affairs because although i raised the noble lords eyebrows when i said this at the last stage i am very much one of those who have always been great believers in the provision of information as widely as possible <e> <s> i believe that that is a very important thing in local government <e>", "<cs> my lords it is rather sad that clause is necessary at all but there should be no doubt in anyones mind that it is necessary <e> <s> the points that the noble baroness advances as i said earlier in the day might well have carried weight some years ago but they ignore the realities of today <e> <s> it is not so long ago that all local authorities would unquestionably assist in implementing the law of the land as sanctioned by parliament however vigorously they might have opposed the passage of legislation during its consideration by parliament <e> <s> i am glad to say that for the vast majority of authorities that still remains the case i wish to make that quite clear <e> <s> but we cannot overlook the activity or should i say the activism of a minority of authorities that are bent on overturning both convention and responsibility <e> <s> they seemingly canvass the proposition that the glc and the metropolitan county councils would in due course if parliament willed the end of their existence see to it that there was an orderly rundown of their affairs <e> <s> in particular they seemingly look to these authorities spending prudently under their discretionary power in section and as my noble friend lord mottistone said safeguarding their ratepayers in the process and smoothing the handover to the successor authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house there are two points that i should like to make <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear is quite right there is concern and that is why i welcome the opportunity to say what i have said on this matter <e> <s> perhaps i should elaborate a little further by saying that the people who have written in have had a lurid picture painted for them <e> <s> i am glad of the chance to make clear where the government stand in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords they have spent millions on advertising <e>", "<cs> no my lords and by the leave of the house what the noble baroness says is quite correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness speaks as if every single payment made under section is as pure as the driven snow <e> <s> in fact it is not so <e> <s> this amendment no <e> <s> would exempt from the control procedure each proposal by an abolition authority for expenditure under section to grant aid a body which that authority had already grant aided during or <e> <s> i accept that the exemption would apply only up to the limit of the total amount of the payments given to the body during and <e> <s> i accept also that it would enable payments to he made without reference to the secretary of state to a number of bodies notably in the voluntary sector who rely heavily on section grants and whose activities are unlikely in the event to be in question <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i again ask the noble lord lord underhill and those who spoke earlier whether they in turn will tell me that every single payment made under section in the past two years has gone to organisations which were proper recipients of monies <e> <s> we are not talking in any way about genuine voluntary organisations <e> <s> i have said again and again that they have nothing at all to fear <e> <s> the fact is that there are millions and millions of pounds going to some of the enterprise boards and other bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i should like to try to respond to the points that have been made <e> <s> first i point out to my noble friend lord broxbourne that of course we shall want to look very carefully at what he has said because clearly that could be of much importance <e> <s> but for the moment let me just say that the new clause and i am also talking to amendment no <e> <s> which is being discussed in general precludes a council from entering into a legally binding contract without consent and consent may be applied for at any time beforehand for example before or after tenders are considered <e> <s> clearly we shall want to consider very carefully what my noble friend said and i assure him as to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that it is simply not possible to draw a clear distinction between the glc in its role as a local authority generally and the glc in its role as an education authority <e> <s> the fact that we propose to reconstitute the ilea as a separate corporate body after the abolition of the glc does not mean that there can be no risk in the education field of the kind of abuse with which the governments new clauses are designed to deal <e> <s> the fact that the ilea has not itself so far as we are aware committed this kind of abuse is not a sufficient reason for trying to distinguish it from the glc in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords in formulating proposals for devolving the functions of the glc and metropolitan county councils the government had to choose between preceding the changes by a review of the metropolitan districts and london boroughs and implementing any changes found necessary or devolving the functions first and deferring the review until afterwards so that they could then take account of the changes actually made and of experience gained in handling the devolved functions <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would remove much of the point of clause <e> <s> clause is an important provision <e> <s> this bill is after all designed to allow the successor authorities every opportunity to prepare for the transfer of functions if and when abolition goes ahead <e> <s> in order to be able to do so they need some influence over the financial situation which they will eventually take over <e>", "<cs> my lords the constituent councils will have a particular interest in the accounts for the years in question <e> <s> they are accounts which relate to expenditure incurred in financial years in which the abolition proposals will have been very much in the minds of the authorities concerned <e> <s> it is surely therefore entirely equitable and indeed necessary that the constituent councils have access and the right to object to the audit of the accounts of all three of these financial years as any one of them might contain attempts to frustrate the task of the successor authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> seeks to remove the subsection which requires the glc and each of the metropolitan county councils to consult the borough or district councils in its area about its budget <e> <s> these are the last budgets which will be implemented by the upper-tier authorities and they will be important matters in the immediate run up to abolition <e> <s> therefore the boroughs and districts have a reasonable and direct interest in them <e> <s> it does not give them unreasonable powers <e> <s> it does not give them any veto powers <e> <s> but this provision will give the boroughs and districts an opportunity to influence decisions which will affect the state of affairs that they will inherit <e> <s> i should have thought that was entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> makes any regulations prescribing what information on expenditure the glc and mccs must make available to the constituent councils subject to affirmative resolution instead of negative resolution <e> <s> i have said already that regulations under subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house as i have said this amendment is consequential upon amendments nos <e> <s> and and introduces controls on the disposals of land and contracts made by the glc and the mccs <e> <s> although the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see anything wrong with it but i do not have a copy so perhaps that is understandable <e>", "<cs> my lords it goes in as marked and it is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first answer the noble lord <e> <s> lord diamond because i appreciated the constructive way in which he made his observations which i must contrast with the intemperate way in which the noble lord lord graham felt it necessary to make his observations while asking his questions <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i well remember how we used to try to manage our capital affairs <e> <s> when i was doing that in leeds we were one of the few authorities which had capital receipts because we were pursuing policies which involved taking derelict land and so on and selling it and we were selling council houses too <e> <s> so we had very substantial capital receipts <e> <s> we had learned how to forecast and anticipate and how to plan ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right in his analysis <e> <s> those are exactly the rules <e> <s> however when one talks about the changing of them what i was really saying when i said that they were not being changed is this <e> <s> we have a situation which the noble lord with his experience and background will appreciate probably more than most people in the house <e> <s> in this situation the totality of the overspending is such that what we are saying to local authorities as a whole and not to individual ones at all is we want you to look at the totality of <e>", "<cs> my lords i see no conflict whatever <e> <s> in the first place the amendment as the noble lord knows refers only to seven authorities <e> <s> here we are dealing with the totality of local government <e> <s> i have been at some pains to stress that we are not singling out any individual authorities <e> <s> in any case the circumstances surrounding the requirements under amendment no <e> <s> are quite different to what we are talking about now <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not actually present but the report to me was that the adc and the acc welcomed the fact that there was not a moratorium <e> <s> nevertheless to say that they were happy about it would be quite wrong <e> <s> the noble lord knows that i would not say that because it was not so <e> <s> but at least they welcomed the chance to go away and look at the situation <e> <s> the ama were not happy <e> <s> they would much prefer that the levels be raised <e> <s> they wanted validation of any increased spending <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord does not expect me to accept what he says <e> <s> the noble lord mentions the construction industry <e> <s> i repeat and emphasise two things <e> <s> the industry will be able to rely on just as much work as was implied in this years public expenditure white paper no more but we are hoping certainly no less <e> <s> the other point which should perhaps be brought out rather more is that any work on urban programme projects and derelict land reclamation can continue unabated <e> <s> that is outside anything that may have been stated now <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in the final stages of the bill <e> <s> this is the third reading <e> <s> i know exactly what the noble lord is saying and the fact that in the past few years the government have put in million is an indication of their concern <e> <s> i am not suggesting in any way that that is the whole of the answer because had it been so we would not have some of the problems that are there now far from it <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord sefton perhaps more than anyone else in your lordships house will understand that <e> <s> indeed he has just said that waving a wand is not the answer <e> <s> what we are concerned with today with this amendment is the attempt to suggest that there be a differentiation <e> <s> if one leaves aside the matters raised by the noble lord lord sefton the first point i made is valid that the amendment as drafted would not even achieve the intention of allowing merseyside to be treated as a special case because it differentiates between the purposes of part ii of the bill rather than between areas <e> <s> since all these purposes are inter-linked there is no need to bring them into effect at different times <e>", "<cs> my lords over the last observation perhaps i may smile because constantly in this and indeed all other legislation the government are accused on the one hand of being too rigid and inflexible and then suddenly they are accused of not being willing to accept a greater flexibility <e> <s> i think it only highlights the great dilemma which is always there in legislation of trying to hold a balance between those two situations <e> <s> of course if you feel about one rather more strongly than about another you will feel that it is not going your way <e> <s> i am sorry that i cannot be more helpful than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must and indeed i do compliment the noble baroness lady birk for her tenacity in attempting to find a working formula for making a repeal order mandatory should the main abolition bill fail <e> <s> this is the third and i would say the most ingenious version we have seen during the passage of the bill through your lordships house <e> <s> nevertheless i am bound to say that the amendment is no more acceptable than were its predecessors <e> <s> as i said i would at report stage i have myself given much thought to ways in which we might meet the understandable concern which prompted this amendment <e> <s> as the noble baroness has kindly said i wrote to her about that <e> <s> but frankly i come back to the same conclusion that there is no way within the bill to tie a mandatory repeal order to a specific date or event without either introducing ambiguity or pre-pledging parliaments consideration of the main bill <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i want very briefly to make one observation and i shall not repeat anything that i said before <e> <s> it ought to be made quite clear that all else apart this amendment would commit the government to abandoning abolition if the necessary legislation had not received royal assent in the next session <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter puts it very explicitly <e> <s> the fact is that these amendments are wholly unacceptable <e> <s> they would strike at the very root of clause by giving the councils a free reign to channel funds to their enterprise boards <e> <s> the funds could then be used for the kind of purposes which must not and shall not be tolerated in particular asset stripping of holdings acquired on the ratepayers behalf and at their expense <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say how grateful i am to my noble friend for his concern about the wear and tear on my clothing in bobbing up and down <e> <s> nevertheless i am sure he has made an important point <e> <s> the least i can do is not to talk at great length for a second time but to say to the noble lord lord graham that i <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that amendment no <e> <s> is intended as an attempt to build reassurance into the bill itself <e> <s> to some extent i sympathise with the reasons why it has been moved <e> <s> it would for example be nonsense for the secretary of state to give approval to a particular item of expenditure under one heading say the urban programme and then to reconsider that approval because that expenditure relied on section for its <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friends for their observations which are very apposite <e> <s> i say at once that we recognise that a considerable number of <e>", "<cs> my lords i must at once totally and utterly refute what the noble baroness says <e> <s> frankly it does no good to be scaremongering on that basis <e> <s> there is not the slightest intention certainly not the wish of government to allow any of the worthwhile voluntary organisations to be adversely affected at all <e> <s> what we are talking about as my noble friend lady gardner reminded us a few minutes ago is that out of the or so authorities in the country we are talking about seven authorities <e> <s> we are talking about something which will operate and last for only one year and in no way will we permit good sound voluntary organisations either to lose grant which they have received or to experience undue delay in receiving it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to repeat what i said at report stage about the need for the new clauses providing for controls on disposals of land and the entering into of major contracts by the glc and the mccs to which these amendments relate <e> <s> but this is still relevant because the effect of these amendments will be to undermine the controls and thus remove the protection which they are intended to give successor authorities and ratepayers against obstructive or irresponsible actions by the outgoing authorities <e> <s> let us be quite clear about this <e> <s> let me try briefly to explain why <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that i shall want to study carefully what the right reverend prelate has said and may i add that in principle i should not want to take back anything which i said in responding to my noble friend lord alport despite the fact that he eventually divided the house <e> <s> we are cognisant of the points which the right reverend prelate made and indeed the points which my noble friend espoused <e> <s> we wish to do nothing that would harm or delay any worthwhile projects and even any transactions and it is not our intention to do so <e> <s> i shall want to consider carefully what the right reverend prelate has said <e> <s> i shall certainly be in touch with him about the matter but in no way does it affect our objection to this amendment as such <e> <s> i take the points that he made and for myself i am confident that there will not be the problems to which attention has quite properly been drawn <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham of edmonton was absolutely right to refer to the reasonable presentation of the noble lord lord evans of claughton <e> <s> it always is reasonable as is the noble lord lord graham of edmontons own presentation <e> <s> i never have any complaint about that or very rarely <e> <s> the amendment would have the effect of confining the controls on disposals of land to disposals where the consideration exceeds <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say at once that i recognise the concern that the new controls will impose additional administrative demands on the outgoing authorities as well as on the department and also the concerns expressed about the industry to which the noble lord lord ezra referred <e> <s> of course the number of applications will depend upon the decisions made by the authorities and upon the number and scope of the prior general consents issued <e> <s> but what i can say first is that all applications received will be handled expeditiously not least bearing in mind what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> i think this really goes without saying but i should like to repeat it because i want to stress the importance of our acceptance of the point that he is making <e> <s> we recognise what he is saying about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand the reasons that have prompted my noble friend lady gardner to table these amendments <e> <s> however i have to say that the government do not believe they are necessary and perhaps i can briefly explain why <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to limit the high courts discretion to make an order of disqualification if clauses or are contravened and to limit the penalties if such an order is made <e> <s> the question of whether a responsible person has acted unreasonably or in deliberate contravention of the provisions in clauses or or whether he has acted in all good faith is already one for the high court to weigh <e> <s> i should point out that there is no express defence of good faith where a contract or disposal above the relevant threshold has been made without the required consent <e> <s> however since the high court will have complete discretion whether or not to impose any sanction good faith would undoubtedly be a powerful plea in mitigation <e> <s> so where a disposal had been made or a contract let in the honest but mistaken belief that no consent was required or that it had already been obtained i am sure that would weigh very heavily with the court which will judge each case on its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble countess will allow me to make my remarks and then of course she can speak <e>", "<cs> not true <e>", "<cs> my lords when i moved the motion that the bill do now pass some of your lordships were kind enough to refer to the courtesy that i have shown throughout the conduct of the bill and perhaps even other bills <e> <s> i must say that your lordships put it very much to the test <e> <s> i have not the slightest intention of dignifying some of the remarks that have been made with a response i do not think that they merit it <e> <s> certainly if one was to measure the speech of the noble lord lord molloy by the decibel level it reached i think we would have to be impressed <e> <s> frankly that is the only thing about it that did impress me <e> <s> it was certainly easy to hear the noble lord made sure that no one sleeps on the other side of bayswater road <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not interrupt the noble lord so perhaps he would do me the same courtesy <e> <s> it is very hard to take but i shall not lower the dignity of the house by indulging in the kind of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble baronesses for their observations and i will try to respond to them <e> <s> in reply to the noble baroness lady birk i would say that the city of london is not selected because it does not reach the target criteria set <e> <s> the whole philosophy is that the criteria must be those which apply to all authorities <e> <s> if the noble baroness has any doubt about that i am quite sure that i would be able satisfactorily to assure her that she is mistaken <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord dean said that there would be little need to consult about a <e>", "<cs> my lords manchester and leeds are not among the designated authorities <e> <s> in view of the legacy which if i may immodestly say my own administration left them i think that leeds still has some way to go <e> <s> they are doing their best to catch up and i have little doubt that they will but those two authorities are not designated authorities <e> <s> on the point of breaking the law even the abolition authorities have been concerned not to do so and i am confident that local government is not in that business <e> <s> i know that we hear the threats and all the talk but there is far too much at stake for them in the broader context and i remain confident that they will not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> i certainly endorse the last point that he made <e> <s> i made it myself and it is very much the governments wish <e> <s> indeed we shall be only too pleased to talk and discuss the matter with them <e> <s> i also know what he refers to when he speaks about its being part of a broader reform in due course <e> <s> the secretary of state has said that nothing is forever and certainly we shall listen with interest to what is said on that by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i always listen with great respect to the noble lord and i really do not mind at all so long as nobody else objects to the noble lord putting his questions in the way that he does <e> <s> he knows very well that that will not trouble me one bit <e> <s> in actual fact when he talked about liverpool getting a windfall and that i said gladly he knows the context in which i said gladly <e> <s> it was the context of wanting to give information to the noble baroness <e> <s> that is the context in which i used the word <e>", "<cs> my lords i do indeed pay tribute to the people to whom the noble lord refers <e> <s> i take my hat off to them now as i have done before <e> <s> it took a lot of courage for them to do what they did <e> <s> the noble lord said that liverpool needs it but you cannot differentiate between authorities as such <e> <s> there are ways in which you can provide additional help as he knows <e> <s> through the urban programme for example some million of specific help goes in <e> <s> if you look at the amount of money provided over the last five years you are measuring it in hundreds of millions of pounds <e> <s> the whole of merseyside had had before this year million <e>", "<cs> my lords two quick answers <e> <s> on the last point the government have no plans for the kind of review that is mentioned <e> <s> i said in answering my noble friend that this must be something that one day i am sure will come about <e> <s> i understand that local government are making approaches even now through the associations and the government will hear what they have to say <e> <s> i am personally not unsympathetic to that being done one of these days what local government now needs is some stability and to settle down with what they have got and that stability we intend to provide <e>", "<cs> my lords no i cannot do that at all <e> <s> the noble lord knows better than i will not say most but almost anyone that this is something which is only settled on an annual basis <e>", "<cs> in order to protect ratepayers in all successor authorities and maintain equity between them we shall seek in the main abolition bill this <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not by mere chance that i make my debut today from the back benches in your lordships house though after some thousands of forays at the dispatch box i suppose it hardly qualifies as a maiden speech <e> <s> let me say at once that from the very short time that i have experienced being a back bencher i think we might give serious consideration to reorganisation of the facilities for back benchers because it is very difficult to know where to put ones papers and other items <e> <s> i wanted my return to the fray so to speak to be on a subject about which i feel strongly and on which i have if i may respectfully say so some in-depth knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect this is one occasion when with the limited time available i know that the noble baroness will excuse me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to respond to a comment if your lordships are equally happy at the extra time it involves <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness had been patient and allowed me one more sentence i would have come to the very point <e> <s> if she will refer to <e>", "<cs> i do not want to make a long speech but there is one factor which has not been referred to <e> <s> whatever else the amendment is whether it is wrecking frivolous or whatever it certainly is delaying because it has already delayed us for almost two hours in our consideration of the bill <e>", "<cs> i still say that that is for another day <e>", "<cs> the committee is obviously <e>", "<cs> i think it most unfair when people on this side who want to speak for the government and against this amendment are being denied the opportunity by shouts from the opposition <e> <s> i have sat patiently listening for exactly three hours not too patiently at times but i think that i shall pay deference to the feelings of the committee which wants to give its decision on this and i shall not make the speech i had prepared <e> <s> but there should be no doubt at all in anyones mind as to where i stand in this matter in that i was one of the people originally concerned with the proposals we have before us and i shall put down my <e>", "<cs> i shall not keep your lordships long because i suspect that if i did i should be repeating many of the arguments already made but there are one or two observations which i should like to make <e> <s> first if the noble lord lord ennals is so concerned that the many bodies which he mentioned are to quote him scared i am not in the least surprised in view of all the distortion publicity and advertising that has been going on <e> <s> it has been going on for so long that it would be rather amazing if they were not scared <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to continue <e> <s> i was there when much of the words and music of this bill were being written <e> <s> i was there when we discussed what might or might not be done to assuage the fears <e>", "<cs> i intend to make only one speech and i want to go on by saying that having been there when it was started having watched the imaginative response of the government to the representations and the consultations and having listened today to what the minister has come forward with i believe that there can be no possible complaint about a lack of response to consultation with organisations such as the ncvo <e> <s> they are highly responsible bodies for which i have the greatest respect <e> <s> so i am satisfied that the government are responding <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware of this fact and if so will my noble friend take steps to ensure that it is more generally publicised <e> <s> the areas to which my noble friends questions are directed actually cover an area half the size of manhattan island <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that it is fast becoming the greatest example of urban regeneration that the world has ever seen <e> <s> is he aware that it is a magnificent example of what the private and public sectors can do when working together to turn areas which were for many years previously sterile and derelict into something which is becoming a great success story all round <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make an observation <e> <s> i listened with much interest to the great concern expressed on all sides of the house for the future position of the work people concerned <e> <s> i certainly look forward to what my noble friend the minister will say with regard to the current position <e> <s> is it not rather astonishing that we have here a bill coming towards the end of its report stage and so far as i am aware the trade unions have persistently refused even to discuss the condition under which these circumstances will come about as regards their own workforce <e> <s> i found in another incarnation acting in another capacity when going up and down the country and seeing people who were so concerned as to what would happen if abolition came about that when i asked who is negotiating for you <e> <s> who is discussing what terms and conditions will apply when the governments policy comes about <e> <s> because it will come about again and again the work people said we dont know because our trade unions are in fact not making representations on our behalf <e> <s> i shall be fascinated to know if they have as yet started to make those representations on behalf of their members <e> <s> in my opinion this is to the great discredit of all concerned who either for political reasons or anything else have ceased to allow or not permitted their own negotiators to speak on behalf of the workforce <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by apologising to your lordships for the fact that i shall not be able to stay until the end of the debate yet having played a small role in the original setting up of widdicombe i feel that it would be proper for me to say a few words on this occasion <e> <s> it will be no surprise when i say that i agree with and wholeheartedly support the bill <e> <s> listening to the noble baroness lady david i did not know whether to laugh or cry <e> <s> the local government of which she spoke is the local government of years ago perhaps or maybe even six or seven <e> <s> it is the local government of the many authorities which still try to maintain the high standards of public service of <e>", "<cs> i have to smile at the apocalyptic scenario which those who support this amendment are painting <e> <s> it seems to me that this is where i came in <e> <s> i have been watching these scenarios being painted so often by noble lords opposite that i feel it is very nice to be back home <e> <s> indeed i have almost missed it and it is nice to hear them again <e> <s> the fact that i disagree with the argument now as i always did in the past means i say again that nothing has changed <e>", "<cs> i did not interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps he will allow me to finish as time is going on <e> <s> i have never thought it necessary to spend money on party political propaganda <e>", "<cs> may i briefly intervene to say one thing on what the noble lord lord underhill has just said <e> <s> he asks do we feel that we should not leave it to the local authority associations to impose self-regulation <e> <s> but the local authority associations have little or no influence upon many authorities who at the present time act in total contradiction of what the majority of the people in these associations would like to do <e> <s> we delude ourselves if we simply accept that there are authorities in the country today who will take the slightest notice of any pious hope that there be self-regulation <e> <s> it is so naive to assume that the ratepayers in some of these authorities like hackney and other extreme left-wing authorities should expect that your lordships should decide that self-regulation by their people will be sufficient <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin with an apology to your lordships and to my noble friend because i fear that i too may not be able to stay until the end of the debate <e> <s> i add my congratulations to my noble friend lord hesketh and to the noble lord lord davies on their maiden speeches <e> <s> i too thought that they were quite splendid and that they augur very well for what we look forward to hearing from them for i hope a long time to come <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very helpful response <e> <s> will he kindly bring to the notice of his colleagues the rather unusual and very effective work which this agency carries out <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might make two points on this subject <e> <s> in the first instance i think it is not a fair point to make to complain that the government are bringing forward an amendment that may not have been discussed in another place <e> <s> i know very well that representations to the government are made continually at all times often long after a bill has passed through another place and the government then may decide that in the light of those representations they will in fact bring forward amendments <e> <s> i think that that is only right and proper <e> <s> it would certainly be vigorously opposed by those members sitting opposite were it not so <e>", "<cs> that is not correct <e> <s> councils receive far more than that <e> <s> councils have permission to spend per cent <e> <s> of the receipts <e> <s> that is different from what they receive <e> <s> they receive much more <e> <s> the balance of what councils receive has to stay at least at present in <e>", "<cs> there is a difference between and at least so far as i am aware <e> <s> if the noble baroness will do as the noble lord lord dean of beswick suggested and refer to what i said on second reading she will see that i expressed concern about the per cent <e> <s> i hope that something can be done to increase that figure because i think that it would help local authorities if we could reach that point within the context of the national economy <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by declaring an interest in that i am a non-executive director of taylor woodrow <e> <s> although the company has no interest in the railway extension it is part of the consortium that would take part in the construction of canary wharf if that proceeds as i hope it will <e> <s> having said that i should like to stress even more that i have another interest <e> <s> i had the privilege of introducing into your lordships house in the very legislation which created the london docklands development corporation <e> <s> therefore i have watched its progress and i use that word deliberately with more than usual interest <e>", "<cs> not to me my lords <e> <s> to me the report was in depth and succinct and it satisfied me on what was said <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord exactly that <e> <s> so far as i am concerned there is no doubt whatever that the bill will be delayed and i suggest that that is the view of most noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as my name has now been mentioned twice let me comment briefly on just two aspects of the matter <e> <s> the noble baroness lady stedman was at great pains to stress how complicated the matter is and how difficult it is to understand <e> <s> i remind her that when we switched in to the block grant system we were told that what we were proposing was so obscure that no one would understand it <e> <s> at that point i asked noble lords who were present in the house which of them would care to stand up to explain the system which had operated under a labour administration for several years <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to welcome this bill <e> <s> it is one thing to be tolerant of the sexual deviation of homosexuality it is one thing not to discriminate against or to persecute those who indulge in the practice <e> <s> the law on the matter is clear enough so far as i am concerned and i am quite content to let is stay as it is in that way <e> <s> our society has set the standards and so be it <e> <s> what to me is abhorrent and why i strongly and vigorously support the bill a number of your lordships have expressed surprise that i should be speaking on this subject is that the bill has considerable local government connotations to which i want to refer <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join with those who have spoken in thanking the noble and learned lord lord scarman for giving us the opportunity to debate this subject which always engenders such considerable feelings <e> <s> frankly there is so much to say that the mind boggles one wonders where to start and how to keep ones observations to a reasonable length not least because there are so many others who wish to speak <e> <s> unlucky indeed are those who have to come at the very end of the list though they often make the best speeches <e>", "<cs> more than <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble earl will read <e>", "<cs> my lords i was rather amused at some of the observations of my noble friend lord mersey <e> <s> as to nuclear-free zones i thought the subject was best summed up for me by the comments of a fellow leeds loiner when i said to him well what do you think about nuclear-free zones <e> <s> and he said eeh ive never heard owt so daft in my life <e> <s> that just about sums it up for me <e> <s> i have never heard anything so ludicrous <e> <s> can you imagine god forbid the wave that came over from chernobyl and as it came towards the nuclear-free zone of manchester it said left turn weve got to bypass this bit because theyve got a sign that says nuclear-free zone <e> <s> what a lot of nonsense really <e>", "<cs> let me pick up one or two points on what the noble lord lord bancroft said when he rather took us away from the subject by his references to local government generally <e> <s> many of us on this side of the committee and i suspect even on the other side would disagree very strongly with him on a number of things he said <e> <s> for example he referred to the government having taken powers to cap rates on every authority in the land <e> <s> it should be put on record that every authority in the land does not have its rates capped it is only those that choose to spend far beyond what is reasonable <e> <s> indeed the people who have to pay the rates and taxes within those authorities are thankful that there is such a measure <e>", "<cs> i shall make just one or two observations on what the noble lord lord dean has said <e> <s> the record has constantly to be put straight when <e>", "<cs> i had to smile when the noble lord talked about local authorities fighting to protect their ratepayers interests <e> <s> i wonder what the people who live in some of the inner london boroughs will say to that <e> <s> they may wonder what kind of fighting is being done on their behalf <e> <s> i suspect that they may think that the local authorities are only fighting to extract ever more money <e> <s> the last thing one could accuse them of is fighting to protect their ratepayers interests <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has a background in local government for which i have great respect <e> <s> if he and others who speak on that side of this committee would only join in the open condemnation of what those people do to the whole of local government not only should we have more respect for the argument but i think it would help <e> <s> that is all that i have sought to do in my observations on local government during the past couple of months <e>", "<cs> let me just say that the minister would never have written to leeds during my time there <e>", "<cs> if anyone can join in just on this one narrow topic let me say that i very much agree with what my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has just said <e> <s> the committee may say well he would wouldnt he <e> <s> i almost invariably have that great pleasure and it gives me no trouble at all <e> <s> but i think that he has a valid point <e> <s> if we are talking about the amount of time that authorities have by way of advance notice i have to say as i have said before in your lordships chamber on more than one occasion that i think back over the years to the amount of notice we used to be given by way of information when i was in local government <e> <s> believe me the time that is given now is far far longer than we used to receive <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a convention of the house that noble lords sit in accordance with their political beliefs and allegiances <e> <s> if anyone were to propose that that should be afforded as a privilege to the right reverend prelates i should be glad to second <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend is aware that many of us feel that a great contribution to this problem of homelessness could be made if local authorities gave priority to repairing many of the houses which currently stay empty numbering scores of thousands all over the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only assume that the noble lord lord bottomley and others who have spoken against the bill live in a different world from the one in which i live and the people i see and the places i go <e> <s> clearly we shall have to agree to disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i was saying <e> <s> it does not apply to all schools and heaven forbid that it should <e> <s> the fact of the promotion of homosexuality applying to any schools is enough the fact that it applies to so many is even worse <e> <s> i have no reservation in speaking as i do upon this point <e> <s> to me it is not delicate it is a matter of grave concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord has a great interest in factuality <e> <s> would he care to comment on information that i have before me which states that in the national health service over contracts have been awarded to private companies for ancillary services <e> <s> the number of different companies which have been awarded such contracts is and less than per cent <e> <s> have been awarded to the market leaders and their subsidiaries bet and the hawley group <e>", "<cs> should we not right at the beginning of these deliberations get a few of the basic facts clearly understood <e> <s> as my noble friend lady blatch said the bill is really about a local authority itself specifying the level of service which it desires in a written form as a specification <e> <s> it does not have to be higher or lower than the local authority feels is necessary so long as it is borne in mind that somebody has to pay for it at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> i was very interested to hear the right reverend prelate the bishop of sheffield tell us that the public sector is now sitting down with the private sector in sheffield <e> <s> i remember in a former incarnation going along to sheffield and trying to get exactly that to happen <e> <s> i was told that it was the first time in years that the local chamber of commerce had gone into the town hall to talk to the elected members <e> <s> as the right reverend prelate rightly said this can only be a move very much in the right direction <e> <s> i am sure that sheffield will benefit as indeed would all other authorities where the same pertains <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what has been said by my noble friends lord elton and lady faithfull <e> <s> despite what the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that the fact that the noble baroness lady fisher asked for further information confirms the need for the clarity which the government are trying to give in the bill <e> <s> if there are doubts then by all means let us have more clarity <e> <s> i should have thought that that would cover the point <e>", "<cs> let me say how fascinating it is to notice that of all members of the committee who spoke yesterday and indeed today whichever point of view they may have taken not one has yet said other than that he wishes to see tolerance of homosexuality continuing <e> <s> that is very much my view <e> <s> if that is what society decides it wants then i support that and i am content to go along with it <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble lord says and he may well have a point <e> <s> it is a point which he wishes to push and he may well be right but i am not satisfied <e> <s> i would need confirmation at first hand <e>", "<cs> it is not that i doubt the noble lord and he knows that <e> <s> i could stand here and take a whole half-hour giving quotations and examples but that is not what the committee wants and for that matter it is not what i want <e>", "<cs> the amendments yesterday were about watering down this clause and today we are deciding if there is a need for it at all <e> <s> so far as i am concerned there is a very great need for it and i hope the committee will support it and not the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make just a brief observation <e> <s> i think that we all agree with the underlying philosophy of the proposed amendment and what it seeks to achieve namely to make it more likely that employers or contractors employ a greater percentage of disabled people <e> <s> that has to apply whether it is in connection with local government contracts or anything else <e> <s> it just happens that we are discussing the matter in the context of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is clearly the intention i should feel differently about that aspect of it <e> <s> i should like to hear what the minister says and whether he too feels there is the possibility of the problems that i have mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the amount of construction and development activity going on in the north of england taken from a line very far above watford is probably greater today than it has been for very many years <e> <s> if one were to look at that activity in detail it would be extremely encouraging not least to those of us who come from that part of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many feel that the point raised earlier by some noble lords even within this question pertains not to hundreds but to thousands and thousands of empty dwellings throughout the country <e>", "<cs> both in the private sector and the public sector <e> <s> however it is in the public sector where the government have an influential role to play even though they are not deciding the priorities for local authorities <e> <s> nevertheless is the minister aware that unless there is a willingness by local authorities to give priority to actually doing something about those thousands of empty dwellings then to raise matters of homelessness simply will not do <e>", "<cs> my lords it is no good a noble lord opposite waving his hands this is a very genuine part of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem of speaking in a debate where there is a long list of speakers is that the longer the debate goes on the more speakers use up all the good points which one had carefully prepared and the more they use the statistics which one was going to quote <e> <s> today the problem for me is even greater because there have been so many distinguished speeches by those who support the same point of view as i do <e> <s> how can one put ones case in a way that is different <e> <s> yet i shall have to try <e>", "<cs> it is hard to get a word in in these long debates but i must say that the feeling of <e>", "<cs> after listening to the last speaker i am not sure whether he is agin us or for us <e> <s> it takes a little working out <e> <s> it may comfort my noble friend to know that i do not speak as someone with a large amount of inherited wealth <e> <s> unlike my noble friend lord auckland i have not spent years in your lordships house it was only nine years ago that i entered this chamber <e> <s> however i have spent much longer as a working practitioner in local government trying to make the rating system work fairly by taking account of peoples ability to pay <e>", "<cs> whichever way we consider it we are talking about who pays for the cost of local services <e> <s> under the present proposals per cent <e> <s> of that cost will come from the national exchequer that is the taxpayers in general <e>", "<cs> i feel about that in exactly the same way as i have always felt in the past about those people who come just above the threshold that they always receive the worst end of the stick <e> <s> but at least under this system we are able to look at the very instances that my noble friend has mentioned <e>", "<cs> i was sure that noble lords opposite would approve of that statement <e> <s> however i wish to say this <e> <s> when one looks at the positive side of the proposals considers the fact that accountability at last is restored to local government and that more or less everyone will be paying at least something towards the cost of local services and one then considers the end to the long-standing patent unfairness of rates the amendment seeks to put the clock back <e> <s> it is nothing more than a recipe for vacillation and that is where we ran into all our trouble in the s <e> <s> we cannot go back <e> <s> i urge my noble friends and even who knows some members of the committee opposite to reject the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too listened with much interest to the timing point made by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> i am just not sure the extent to which that would have all the adverse repercussions that he mentioned <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that that is something which must be looked at very closely <e> <s> i do not at all accept the point about the confusion to the electorate to which the noble lord lord mcintosh referred <e> <s> in actual fact i cannot imagine a better situation than the electorate being called upon to give their verdict on a community charge level which had been fixed by an authority and which could only be reduced if the authority were capped <e> <s> i can imagine what their reaction to that might be <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may remind the noble lord lord jay that i served in local government at a time when the rate support grant was not per cent <e> <s> but per cent <e> <s> two-thirds <e> <s> one may therefore wonder what effect that had on both the independence and the accountability of the local authorities under such a regime <e>", "<cs> just to put the record straight i should like to say to the noble lord lord jay that the figure of per cent <e> <s> to which i referred was without the business rate which was charged to business people <e> <s> heaven knows what the percentage was then but it would have been much larger <e>", "<cs> i wonder what evidence there is to show that people under the age of the people to whom the noble baroness lady jeger referred are in any way worse off today than they were in previous years under administrations which she supported <e> <s> where is the evidence to show that that is so when she says this government seem to hate young people <e> <s> i do not believe that she should be allowed to get away with that as a statement and it then be assumed that that is a fact <e> <s> many of us on this side of the committee would vigorously deny that that is so <e>", "<cs> it may be that i was lucky <e> <s> i suggest that there are many others who are lucky too <e> <s> while it is true that there are those in the categories to which the noble baroness referred nevertheless there are many who choose to live away from home <e> <s> there is nothing at all wrong in doing that <e> <s> indeed that is to be encouraged if it is so wished <e> <s> however that does not detract from the fact that in so doing such persons actually add to the burden of the housing problem <e> <s> this is not to say that one should not always try to better the situation <e> <s> i am sure that members on all sides of the committee subscribe to that <e> <s> nevertheless it is a fact that those who could stay at home but choose not to do so add to the problem <e> <s> i do not believe that it helps the discussion at all to say that that is not so <e>", "<cs> i do not say anything of the kind <e> <s> there will always be people who wish to find work in other places if it is not available locally <e> <s> surely that is not to suggest that that is the basis of the whole problem <e> <s> it is clearly not so <e> <s> it does not add to the debate to distort the facts as they are and that is the point i am taking up with the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i should like to make the same point as my noble friend lady blatch <e> <s> the noble lord lord stallard said that there was a lot of money to be made from empty rooms <e> <s> i wonder therefore why we are not concerned that there are over empty dwellings in the private sector and some empty dwellings in the public sector <e> <s> those are empty rooms <e> <s> if we look at the reasons for the empty rooms we come back to the underlying theology of the bill <e>", "<cs> i think that we are losing sight of what the bill is trying to do <e> <s> the bill is trying to encourage landlords who at present have dwellings and who will not rent them out because of lack of security of tenure and because of their inability to obtain reasonable rents for those dwellings <e> <s> the more we impose restrictions the less likely it is that those dwellings will become available <e> <s> surely that is the underlying nub of what we are seeking to do <e>", "<cs> but the fact is that if dwellings remain empty for whatever reason that helps no one at all <e> <s> if landlords do not make them available for rent it helps no one <e> <s> i submit and i am sure the minister submits also that the whole purpose of this part of the bill is to make more dwellings available <e> <s> i remember very well introducing the shorthold concept in this chamber <e> <s> members opposite said that it would be the policy of their party when it returned to office to do away with the concept of shorthold tenancies <e> <s> that put quite a kybosh on that whole concept <e> <s> it discouraged landlords who might have been willing to offer dwellings for rent <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say at once that i was never on an honours list at all i came here not for services rendered but rather for services to be rendered <e> <s> whether or not i rendered them adequately is for your lordships to decide not for me <e>", "<cs> my lords nevertheless i am encouraged by the fact that those bodies are working together <e> <s> i remind the noble lord that that was not always the case although it is the case now <e> <s> the areas controlled by those bodies are benefiting accordingly <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that the research was just catching up with them <e> <s> i should make one reference to something which roy hattersley then a member of the labour cabinet said in a radio programme in june <e> <s> it puts the party political ends point in context <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be kind enough to equate his question on the representation of trade union people with the representation of conservatives during the same period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the bill <e> <s> the necessity for it saddens me <e> <s> but along with others i warned again and again that if local government could not and would not itself do something about the abuses which have long been taking place and which have been highlighted so often in the end government would have to step in <e> <s> that is what has now happened <e> <s> the indictment on local government is that it has acquiesced <e> <s> it has stood by and done nothing to eradicate the evil practices with which the bill deals <e> <s> it has steadily and progressively stood aside while itself and others have progessively corrupted and undermined what was previously a fine reputation <e> <s> there has been no shortage of expressions of regret and dismay <e> <s> there has been the ritual wringing of hands by the <e>", "<cs> can you believe it <e> <s> the list is long <e> <s> others may quote more such examples <e> <s> in my submission it is wrong and contrary to all that is good in local government <e> <s> when members of the public consult the local government officer for advice or to make representations they are entitled to expect that they are coming to an independent person not someone who is actively committed and involved in politics <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh has just talked about a serious and restrictive policy in practice <e> <s> that is exactly what we are talking about <e> <s> how can a person be a public servant and work for an authority if at the same time he is a member of parliament or of any body which requires him to be <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make another observation to answer the point made by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i certainly did not have firemen in mind when i gave illustrations and examples <e> <s> usually firemen do not give advice to the public on matters other than fire on which i am sure they are well qualified <e>", "<cs> i too have some sympathy with the point that the noble lord lord mcintosh makes <e> <s> however my noble friend touched oh the answer to it <e> <s> one cannot draw an exact analogy <e> <s> in this chamber we do not do the same things at all as a local authority has to do <e> <s> we do not have the job the function of placing contracts and making planning decisions and a whole host of activities which are everyday routine matters in a local authority <e> <s> we do not have to carry out those duties at all <e>"]
