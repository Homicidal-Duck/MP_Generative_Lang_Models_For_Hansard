take too long over what we have got to do or to fit what we have to do in the time that there is to do it in <e> <s> if i were to suggest that your lordships should rise now which i cannot help feeling would be the general feeling in the chamber <e>", "<cs> i must say that we have only thursday and friday left in order to get the committee stage of this bill completed <e> <s> the difficulty is this if we sit too late on a thursday the friday sitting becomes technically impossible from the point of view of the running of the house <e> <s> therefore if we were to rise now we shall be faced on thursday with the position that at a certain stage let us say we shall have to take a view as to whether we sit on until we finish or whether we can in fact finish on the friday <e> <s> so it is strictly limited <e> <s> this is really the last open-ended committee stage <e> <s> i do not know what other noble lords may think <e> <s> perhaps the house might rise now but if so we would virtually be giving a commitment to getting the bill through on thursday or if necessary on friday <e>", "<cs> it may seem unreasonable to ask the committee to discuss these matters at but would it not be that much more unreasonable if the debate goes on for the same length of time on thursday going on very much later <e> <s> however there is probably not a lot of use in considering this much further and
