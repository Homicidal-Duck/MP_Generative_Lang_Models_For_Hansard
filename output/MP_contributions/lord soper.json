["<cs> my lords i would add my congratulations to members of the front bench opposite and thank the noble lord lord melchett for introducing this topic <e> <s> it is noticeable that throughout the debate hitherto one aspect of priorities the economic has had exclusive comment vested in it but the word social which finds its place on the order paper i think permits another aspect to be considered one of far wider concern than merely the economic considerations if merely is the right word to which the house has listened with such profit <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that i have just a few moments and i should like to occupy them by first of all repeating the thanks which i offered at the beginning of this debate to all those taking part in it and not least for the reply of the noble lord lord belstead the sympathetic demeanour which he has demonstrated the options which he has left open for us and the prospects which lie before us <e> <s> i may perhaps be permitted to make one comment about detoxification <e> <s> when a question was asked in another place not so long ago i regret to say that the minister repsonsible for the reply did not know much about it <e> <s> he <e>", "<cs> my lords i came to your lordships house this afternoon with the intention of thanking the noble earl for proposing the second reading of this bill and with an equally firm intention of voting for it if necessary and nothing that has transpired over these hours has in any way disturbed that conviction <e> <s> indeed in some ways it has reinforced it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful as the house will be to the noble earl for reintroducing this topic <e> <s> i reflect that many years ago it was my privilege so to introduce it and i remember repeating myself on a number of occasions when i ask the question to which i find the answer perhaps more obvious now than heretofore as to why it is that a problem of this size and gravity should require the constant attention of your lordships house as if it has been under-valued under-rated and not understood <e> <s> i suggest that there are probably two reasons <e> <s> one is that alcoholism is an uncomfortable and unpopular topic and suffers for the same kind of inhibition which i remember calverley recorded in his poem about smoking <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we are surely talking about a matter far greater and more significant than administrative changes <e> <s> last week we discussed a reduction in public services to miserable and helpless alcoholics <e> <s> yesterday in another place there was a fiery debate on the reduction of services in the realm of education <e> <s> the debate this afternoon is about the reduction of services <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful i am sure to my noble and ecclesiastical friend for initiating this debate <e> <s> let me quickly say how ardently i concur with his appeal that there should be a comprehensive attempt to deal with this urgent problem <e> <s> the haemorrhage of usefulness and happiness among youth is intolerable and no one should underrate the traumatic effects upon the youth of any community when that youth is beset with so many of the problems of which we have already heard in some detail <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to my noble friend lord longford for reintroducing an issue which it seems your lordships house has been attracted to debate on a number of occasions recently and on which i have ventured to speak on matters which are cogent to this particular issue <e> <s> i must be careful to remember the biblical warning that one is not necessarily heard for ones much speaking <e> <s> nevertheless i believe that this is an aspect of a crisis which goes far beyond the merely custodial or prison system or the prison service as such <e> <s> i cannot conceal from myself and i would not endeavour to conceal from this house my belief that the prison system as such is irremediable <e> <s> in as much as this report does not say so i am consequentially disappointed <e> <s> but that disappointment is considerably abated by the fact that although it will take some time to replace the system the best should be made of what can be done if anything to improve it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i presume to interrupt the minister before he sits down because i asked a specific question about the funding under of hostels dealing with alcoholics <e> <s> the arrangement has been that such funding will end in march of next year <e> <s> may i ask whether the government will be prepared to reconsider that in the light of the very serious position it will raise in the next two years before we have opportunities if the government continue to press that point of making alternative arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my thanks to those already expressed by others at the opportunity which my noble friend has given us to take part in this debate and for the excellent opening speech which he made <e> <s> i am particularly attracted of course to that part of the motion which has to do with the impact particularly on the poorer sections of the community <e> <s> it is to that that i wish to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i do not accept that correction <e> <s> i believe it is a misunderstanding of the primary situation which to me is that we live in a class society and these various cuts are increasing the acerbity of the class society rather than encouraging the one thing which a government can expect <e> <s> a government can expect the co-operation of those who feel that the burdens are invariously and generously accepted and borne by the community as a whole <e> <s> we do not live in a community as a whole <e> <s> ask any of these old people who are required to deal with these slashing cuts and enormous increases in prices and it will be found that they will feel the more alienated from the general condition that is at least advertised as a community the noble lord may shake his head but these are my convictions and i am not going to be deflected from declaring them <e> <s> i declare them my lords because i have had some experience <e>", "<cs> my lords had it been my privilege to have preceded the noble duke who introduced this discussion i would have endeavoured to say with the cogency which he commanded very much what i will now say in brief in order not to delay your lordships <e> <s> there were slight variations of course <e> <s> i confess and claim no interest and i have no commitment to casinos not that that gives me any holier position but merely that i have escaped that particular occupation <e> <s> therefore i have no interest in them <e> <s> i am concerned about clauses and <e> <s> had clause been concerned with the production and distribution of holy <e>", "<cs> my lords the provenance of this bill is at least twofold it might be manifold <e> <s> but there are certain clauses which are strictly consequential upon the declared public policy of the government to reduce public expenditure <e> <s> it is therefore to those clauses referring to school meals and to transport that i would seek to attract the attention of your lordships house once again as has already been done many times in this debate <e> <s> i regard the clauses referring to school meals and the clause referring to school transport as pestiferous <e> <s> i said in a previous debate a week or so ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the whole of this debate and am the more grateful as it has developed for the way in which the noble lord lord clifford opened the gate into a field in which such profitable tillage has been provided by speaker after speaker <e> <s> i have had the opportunity of relishing the maiden speech of the noble lord lord murton for which i sincerely thank him and i am much tempted to dilate or to comment upon some of the remarks made in previous speeches <e> <s> as the hour is late i shall do nothing of the sort but with some trepidation will recall the house if i may to that which lies behind this debate <e> <s> it is the question as to what human beings do under the threat of armed violence and in particular of what we now know as war <e> <s> that is what we are endeavouring to talk aboutit is the defence against that particular adversity with which we are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords if i bring to your lordships house the authority of the free church council and share it with lord taylor of blackburn it is not because i regard this as an ecclesiastical issue <e> <s> i hope that we shall not be deluded into thinking that this is a question as to whether it is proper for schools to be voluntary or state supported or whether they should be ecclesiastical schools <e> <s> there are those in your lordships house who approve of the one system while there are many who disapprove of it <e> <s> the reason why i believe it would be totally improper to retain this clause in the bill is on other grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords many in your lordships house and myself in particular are obliged regularly and frequently to the noble earl for introducing topics of this nature to which i am irresistibly attracted <e> <s> if i say something about my own reaction to lifers that reaction is compounded of the number of convictions and confirmations which have come to me as a result of being a prison chaplain in pentonville prison for some long time <e> <s> i will briefly list them <e> <s> it was my experience that many of these people who attracted life sentences were very bad men <e> <s> therefore i attach no sentimental attitude that is bereft of a recognition that although i do not believe any one of them was totally depraved i am sure that many of them were indeed very wicked <e> <s> that did not in any way inhibit my conviction that by the grace of god they could be improved but it did require the answer to a second immediate question was that improvement likely to be undertaken by the provisions of the prison service <e> <s> i believe that the prison service is irremediable as an institution endeavouring to provide the opportunity for wicked people to improve <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to ask a question on behalf of the largest voluntary body in the country the christian church and i think in this respect i can probably represent it <e> <s> we welcome heartily the proposition that money will be available for overnight accommodation which can be provided by these voluntary bodies which have only been prevented from so doing by the lack of funds up to now <e> <s> this will deal with at least some of the overcrowding which we all deplore <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that not all demonstrations are itinerant <e> <s> is there concern as to what goes on in the regular pitches on sunday afternoons in particular in hyde park <e> <s> if so will there be permission given for us to take a collection in order to defray the expenses <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill attracts my enthusiastic opposition not particularly because i happen to sit on these benches but because as i believe in the language of priorities it is ethically ill-natured and therefore i find the various defences that have been put up for individual articles in its premises and suggestions may or may not be vulnerable may or may not be suitable to the particular need of the present day but in principle i want to give a number of reasons why i believe the bill is wrong <e> <s> my noble friend lord wells-pcstell deplored the absence of any episcopal presence in your lordships house this afternoon although that was somewhat remedied a little later on <e> <s> he did not very properly refer to the absence of a spiritual presence and i think i may arrogate to myself on this occasion the ability to speak for the church not only the church of england but the methodists and others who in general principle would support the kind of objections which i will now briefly adduce against the bill <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> the bill is wrong and i should have preferred to have its throat cut on second reading and if that sounds a somewhat blood-thirsty observation for a pacifist i feel blood-thirsty about this bill because it is fundamentally immoral and the various efforts that have been made to justify it fall to the ground with a very loud bang <e> <s> i canvass the proposition which was widely advertised in the press that one of the reasons behind the governments proposal of the bill was that there were quite a number of people taking advantage of the amenities and that such skrimshankers should be repulsed <e> <s> the noble baroness very indignantly defended the bill from any such observation and condemnation and i of course accept her word <e> <s> but if it is not for that reason let us look perhaps for a second reason which would be justifiable and that is the money which the government need and will find from the prosecution of these measures <e>", "<cs> my lords i too at first sight of the motion on the order paper shared with the noble lord lord carrington a sense hotch-potch but after listening to the admirable speech of my noble friend lord stewart of fulham i saw that there was a connecting link between the various items he had selected for especial attention and that there were underlying problems which were by no means of a hotch-potch nature <e> <s> one of them which seems to me to be relevant but which hitherto has not been adumbrated is that there is an almost apocalyptic element in the problems suggested by and specified in the three or more parts of the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful i am sure for the opportunity to discuss a matter of such vital importance as that which has been introduced in this particular unstarred question by my noble friend lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> earlier today it was reported that the noble lord lord carrington speaking in mexico said that the economic situation in the world dwarfs every other consideration even that of afghanistan <e> <s> i believe that the significance of this motion will be judged in relation to the words of the noble lord lord carrington rather than by the number of people engaging in this debate in your lordships house at this comparatively late hour <e>", "<cs> i strongly desire to support this amendment <e> <s> i will not delay the committee by any large comments on the comparative benefactions of multinational organisations and the christian church though i would have thought that there was a perceptible difference between compassion and self-interest even when it is enlightened <e> <s> what strikes me about this particular discussion is that we may be in danger of confusing education with the proliferation of facts whereas education surely must consist in the discriminatory way in which we examine what the facts are what they divulge and what lies behind them <e> <s> it is for that reason that i cordially support my noble friend lord hatch in his assertion that to consider as an educational requirement the third world in its developing or undeveloped nature and the interrelationship of various communities in a global context has a priority that is incapable of being challenged today <e>", "<cs> my lords without any intention of condoning shoplifting are the government aware of the very strong feeling among those engaged in social work and not only in the churches that this particular evil presents a unique and unprecedented temptation to those who otherwise are able to deal with if not eradicate their content of original sin <e> <s> is it not desirable that those who are in the first instance responsible for apprehending so-called shoplifters should be instructed or at any rate someone should tell them more accurately than seems hitherto to have been done what is a genuine sympathetic and at the same time right procedure that they should take <e> <s> is it not the experience of many who have to deal with those who have been shoplifting and have been punished <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly i would seek to rebut the contention so persuasively made by the noble lord lord home that this amendment is superfluous <e> <s> may i recall from clause of the bill that which first attracted my attention and support <e> <s> programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords the house of course is grateful to the noble earl lord cathcart for introducing a topic of such overwhelming importance as i think in many of its consequences to be almost a terminal one <e> <s> it is the question as to how by what political means there can be an avoidance of the holocaust of another war <e> <s> as the house will remember clausewitz said that war is the continuation of politics by other means <e> <s> i would presume to offer the pacifist case as the other means by which war can be once and for all forgotten and that the political measures which will be included in that pacifist programme will be adequate to save the world from that kind of disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords i am attracted to the question raised by this bill <e> <s> the propositions attached to that question form a very single-minded background and i share with the noble lord lord inglewood the purpose however fragile and small that such a bill as this will do something to improve the situation a situation which has got steadily worse with regard to alcohol and now presents as i see it and as i think your lordships will see it a major problem for the community in which we live <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness would allow me to remark that the parable is not about a black sheep but one rather helpless lamb that got lost and was discovered by the zealous shepherd <e>", "<cs> my lords may i reinforce what the right reverend prelate has just said and ask the minister whether it is true that the churches in el salvador and notably archbishop romero just before he was cruelly murdered insisted to the american government so far as they were able to do that what <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be a courtesy and a privilege for a member of one of the other religious bodies to express our sense of gratitude to the church of england for this bill <e> <s> though we have approximately the same number of people dying regularly as those in the church of england we have been incommoded by an inability to bury them properly in consecrated ground and therefore i think i speak ecumenically for the other non-anglican communities in saying how much we appreciate the purpose and the significance of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who took part in earlier debates on this theme and was convinced then of the rightness of this bill and who does not find that time has withered that argument or that the years have condemned it i rise to support what has already so eloquently and convincingly been said by the mover <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government fully aware of the change in the nature of this dependency in the last few years away from personal characteristics which would render particular people liable to become addicts to the general stress and sense of loss of useful occupation which has meant in many of the places where they have been cared for a need for greater attention to be paid to rehabilitation after the preliminary drying out has been secured <e>", "<cs> i have no pleasure in finding myself in disagreement with my ecclesiastical friends but nevertheless i feel there is a need to present certain evidence which hitherto i think has been stated but certainly not proven <e> <s> may i preface what i have to say with a gentle comment about the relationship of a taboo to morality <e> <s> a taboo is that which you persist in until you have got the sense to get rid of it <e> <s> therefore i find no comfort in the idea that preservation of the levitical code is an expression of the way in which we have developed in our spiritual understanding for which in a period of henotheism as your lordships will know in which that code was first adumbrated very different parameters were required than those which belong to a civilised society today <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the first occasion on which i have been glad to be led by my noble friend lord longford in discussion of matters which to me to him and i take it to this house even as sparsely <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very pleasant thing to follow my noble ecclesiastical friend and to express my total agreement with the spirit in which he spoke of which we should all be sensible and indeed we should be grateful <e> <s> i also want to express my thanks to my noble friend lord wells-pestell not only for the substance of what he said but for the introduction in what he said of his own feeling of anger which i share <e> <s> anger is a good aperitif in the feast of reason for our soul but it is a very bad main course and i do not propose to indulge in it except to say that i have a very strong sense of the injustice which so many people feel at what are called these cuts <e> <s> i share with my noble friend his desire to make an appeal to your lordships particularly shall we say <e> <s> on the other side of the house to consider again what in fact is happening not only in the actual conditions in which so many of our contemporaries are living but also in their feelings and attitudes <e>", "<cs> my lords i also wish to thank my noble friend lady birk for introducing this topic and to congratulate her on the improvement in her voice as the proceedings went forward <e> <s> of course as a temperance reformer i am sure that had nothing whatever to do with the contents of the glass on the table but only reflected the prescription of john wesley who referring to sore throats said preach them out <e> <s> that was to some extent justified by the remarks with which my noble friend introduced the debate and i am grateful for the substance of those remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to those which have already been expressed to the noble baroness lady seear for introducing this debate <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness has been particularly gratified by the spread of the arguments and the general nature of the debate itself epitomised by three remarkable felicitous maiden speeches and i should also like to congratulate the noble lords who made them <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord any intention in his forthcoming visit to moscow or will he have any opportunity of getting in touch with the russian orthodox church <e> <s> i ask the question for the specific reason that there is evidence of an increasing determination by that church to press their peace counsel further than i think the authorities are inclined to approve yet at the same time there is an increased sense according to the documents that i receive from time to time that the church is taking a more independent line with regard to peace-making <e> <s> i do not know whether this is within the schedule of the foreign secretary but i suggest that it could be of considerable importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to those already offered to the maiden speakers and to thank them for the substance of what they had to say and the characteristic way in which they said it <e> <s> were this debate confined to recondite arguments as to the disposition of available resources within the defence policy and indeed decked out with speculations as to the psychological reactions of major powers it might seem to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may briefly reply to the noble earl i quite agree that by we had fallen over the cliff and that there was nothing we could do but go to war but the prevention of war must take place much earlier than that <e> <s> i am committed to the belief that the wages of sin are death that if you go on doing what is wrong for long enough you lose your capacity to do what is right <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering the various topics set out in the queens speech i would commend to your lordships that there is no debate in this house that the issues involved in defence are incomparably more important and ultimate than any other considerations to which we might give our attention and already have done <e> <s> here is a matter of life and death <e> <s> here is a matter in the opinion of many which involves a terminal condition possibly for the human species and i say that carefully not on my own authority which is marginal but on the authority of people who seem to know a very great deal about it <e> <s> indeed this is an apocryphal debate and if matters of life and death are involved and if apocrypha are introduced then in one sense i am entitled or at least under some compulsion to speak as a would-be christian <e> <s> it is on that theme that i would intervene in this debate at this time <e>", "<cs> yes of course <e>", "<cs> yes i can my lords <e> <s> for instance i can indicate the programme that was offered by the soviet union for inspection and reduction of armaments <e> <s> that was in i think <e>", "<cs> well in the last years no i am not in any position to give the noble lord a particular answer but i should have thought that this is by no means a denigration of the argument <e> <s> what i am saying is that in principle what has happened is that every attempt that has been made has in fact produced only a more serious condition than that which preceded it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are becoming semantically rather confused <e> <s> i am talking about attempts which have been made consistently on both sides to arrange for meetings as a result of which programmes of disarmament could be envisaged and could in fact be undertaken and i am perfectly sure that that has happened over and over again <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be permitted to add a word as a methodist minister <e> <s> robert bradford was a methodist minister and he carries and has carried the sympathy and understanding of all methodists and i would like to be associated with what has already been said <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to take part in the debate because i share the desperation indicated in the letter from the governor of one of the block prisons in london <e> <s> it is a long time ago since i was responsible for nonconformists and others in pentonville prison <e> <s> i remember very distinctly the realisation that then came to me and which has not altered through the years though now my visits to prisons are not so frequent as they used to be <e> <s> the realisation was that a prison such as pentonville or wormwood scrubs is one of the most uncivilised elements in a community which at least claims some civilisation as part of its normal and public life <e> <s> there have of course been improvements <e> <s> there has been the right of congress within the prisons which i welcomed and which is a token of many improvements which are still being made <e> <s> but those improvements do not alter in any vital degree my complete conviction that the block prison system is uncivilised and immoral let alone unchristian <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to my noble friend lord beswick for introducing a topic in which we are invited to think rather more in depth than perhaps some of these debates invite <e> <s> i find particular satisfaction in the emphasis which i believe can be laid and must be laid upon the thinking in depth about a political situation which i believe is unprecedented and i deplore although i claim no profundity myself the erosion of such thinking in depth <e>", "<cs> i can only suggest my lords that there has been such wide disagreement among reputable theologians on this point that the issue is not necessarily as the noble lord states <e> <s> i would quote dr laffan in my defence <e> <s> i do not know who the noble lord would quote in his <e>", "<cs> my lords had been a member of the christian church in the primitive days when they were lively in their expectation of the parousia i should have thought myself considerably more at home in this debate than in some that have occasioned your lordships attention for there has been an underlying current of apocalyptic in what has been discussed today particularly in what was said from the benches behind me by the noble lord lord vernon <e> <s> indeed it is a critical question and may be a terminal one to which we are invited to address ourselves today <e> <s> for that reason i am more than grateful to the noble lord who initiated this debate for the way in which he brought to bear upon our consideration two factors which think are imperative <e> <s> the first is the personal that is to say we are dealing with people and the second is the moral <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege to be the first to congratulate the noble lord who has just resumed his seat on his maiden voyage and especially if i may say so to congratulate him on referring to two elements which were contained in that most felicitous speech of his first the enduring amity between the people of this country and the people of canada and secondly the very large measure of agreement that seemed a few years ago to be beyond the ability of the provinces to achieve but which has now almost but not quite produced unanimity <e> <s> i hope we shall hear the noble lord again and we shall i am sure profit as much next time as we have on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be presumptuous of me to claim that i could speak for the christian churches as a whole but there are certain elements in the present lamentable situation which i believe can be expressed for all those who belong to the christian faith <e> <s> the first is the condemnation of the unprovoked and wicked attack that has been made on the falkland islands <e> <s> secondly there is our detestation of the tyrannical government of the argentine and thirdly there is our understanding of the difficulties that confront the noble lord the foreign secretary and those associated with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not rehearse in this short debate the observations on the general question to which i have given some attention in previous debates <e> <s> but i am grateful to my noble friend for his pertinacity in continuing to raise this very important issue <e> <s> i shall confine myself to the vexed question of overcrowding but i should like to make a preliminary observation about my own experience not as immediate as that of my noble friend who has been speaking of his own experience within prison life but as a chaplain for many years in pentonville prison of the fatal flaw in the whole prison system and about the necessity as i see it the peremptory necessity to provide alternative custodial or semi-custodial opportunities for those who now languish in our old-fashioned and inadequate prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the free churches would want to be associated with the words of condolence and sympathy that have already been offered to those who have suffered in the present conflict <e> <s> is he further aware that there is widespread disagreement within the churches and that it would be totally wrong to assume that the concept of the just war is generally held by those who profess the christian faith <e> <s> finally is he aware that there is unanimity so far as a person such as i am can try to discover it as regards the peremptory need for a temporary cease-fire if nothing more profitable than that in order that the principles that have invigorated much of the discussion and the principles which have underlaid many of the attitudes towatds this concept can in fact have freer play than is possible within the general environment of armed violence <e> <s> therefore will he press forward with some kind of attempt to prepare a cease-fire a moratorium even for the shortest of time in order to give licence and opportunity for other principles to take their place within the solution of this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to appeal to the government even at this late hour to resist what seems to them to be the inevitable consequence of their purposes and to continue to give heed to the secretary-general of the united nations in his plea that there should be a continuation however unpromising it may appear of the negotiations short of the mass violence which is war <e> <s> i do this because i am convinced that on utilitarian grounds it is possible now to raise the argument against the use of war in the terms which the noble lord lord hooson has already adumbrated and in which he has set forth the position so clearly and unmistakably <e> <s> it is the nature of war which from the utilitarian standpoint is indefensible in terms of what it does what it can be calculated to do and what its inevitable effects are going to be <e>", "<cs> my lords first i want to say a few words of thanks and to express admiration to my noble friend lord brockway for introducing this topic and not least for the coverage he gave to the affairs that have <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the british council of churches and the catholic institute for social affairs have both made representations to the government in general support of the nature of this question <e> <s> if he is so aware what response have the government made to these very strong recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords the claim that the unifying process which has already taken place is a good one is a claim which is irrefutable but i would invite your lordships to think again about the short sharp shock sentence <e> <s> that is much more complicated in its effect than the assumption that it will probably lead to an amelioration in the character of those who are subjected to it <e> <s> my own experience over many years of having something to do with young offenders is that the initial incarceration process leads to all kinds of psychological difficulties and results and i believe that only a few of them are necessarily beneficial <e> <s> the danger of the short sharp sentence is that psychologically it is unsound and therefore should be rejected on the grounds that it does not in fact produce the kinds of result now advertised as coming from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to be associated with the acclamation offered to the noble lord lord maclehose on the occasion of his most trenchant maiden speech <e> <s> on the last two occasions on which defence has loomed in your lordships house i presumed to profess and advocate the pacifist position <e> <s> i warn myself on the highest authority that i am not necessarily heard for my speaking much but i shall detain your lordships for a brief time in assessing at least in three areas further reasons which seem substantial to me for the furtherance of the pacifist argument and its ultimate necessity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sensible of the generosity with which the noble lord lord carrington referred to pacifists as did indeed the noble lord lord home and i found those expressions of unilateral action and kindness most disarming <e> <s> i should like to respond by making a very clear statement before i indulge in some other matters which i hope will be clear but may well be controversial <e> <s> but i have no doubt as to the utter sincerity if that is not impudent so to say of those who will support this motion <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of the noble lord lord hunt next on the list of speakers i presume that i must continue <e> <s> i remember the opportunities that have come our way in your lordships house over many years now of taking part in this kind of discussion <e> <s> i welcome this further opportunity and am grateful for the introduction that we have already received from both previous speakers regarding the nature of the issue with which we are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two topics in your lordships house which i find irresistible or nearly so <e> <s> one is the question of war and peace and the other is the issue of unemployment <e> <s> that is why i am presuming to take part in this debate tonight <e> <s> these two issues have a number of things in common <e> <s> they are both apocalyptic in one sense they are unprecedented and there is no point is looking back as if to find in a history book the kind of evidence which can supply the answer to a contemporary problem <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that during the past few days a document has been published by a group called unleash sponsored by the church of england authorities which indicates that on any ordinary night in london there are at least single homeless people very few of whom i imagine prefer that to some kind of domiciliary comfort <e> <s> will the government take account of the propositions made in that document for a closer relationship between government authority in general and local authorites who would be only too glad to have the opportunity to do better if they had more money with which to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords the backcloth of this debate is the prevalence of crime of various kinds and the indubitable increase of this particular malevolence behaviour and practice <e> <s> separated as i have been on the list of speakers i am nevertheless in complete agreement with my noble and ecclesiastical friend the right reverend prelate that this is pre-eminently a moral issue <e> <s> being a moral issue your lordships will perhaps allow me to comment very briefly on one or two aspects that were presented by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> it so happens that my father was one of the first to take part in this particular enterprise many years ago and i remember with affection and a very great respect the kind of attitude that he not only shared with those who took part in that same kind of activity but was generously shared by the church <e> <s> we are often accused of being irrelevant <e> <s> this was an occasion on which we were probably the advance guard of an essential element in the custodianship of virtue or at any rate the prevention of crime <e>", "<cs> my lords i would add my tribute of thanks to the noble lord lord seebohm for introducing what by any estimation seems to me to be one of the most imperative and important issues upon which your lordships could be engaged <e> <s> i would approach it from the standpoint of the church <e> <s> in this regard i dare say that i can speak without impudence for the bench of bishops who are engaged on their proper business in york at this moment for there is a tradition within the christian church with regard to poverty which should not be excluded from this debate <e> <s> we have always believed in the necessity of almsgiving <e> <s> this is not a peculiar attitude that is unknown elsewhere <e> <s> i believe that one of the quadruple

both unexpected and nourishing <e> <s> i believe that this is an aspect of the problem which will probably go further than is required for a debate of this nature but i hope that the government will take careful note both of what was said about the implications of diet on the possibilities of violence both in the house and outside it and of the possibility which with the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble viscount for introducing this topic may i express my intention to follow in the steps of my right reverend friend and to talk about the religious element which belongs to this highly complicated question professionally because i am sure that religion is of paramount importance pragmatically because the attempt to differentiate between ethnic and religious problems here is i believe a waste of time inasmuch as so many of the existing problems are an intermingling of ethnic and religious principles or prejudices <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank my noble friend for raising again this incomparably important issue and i should like to say how much i admire his persistent efforts to make this matter of the termination of the human race a matter from which <e>", "<cs> my lords let me first add my congratulations and best wishes to my prelatorial friend on his maiden speech which if he will allow me to say so was as cogent and as relevant as i would have expected <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble leader for the fact that i was not in my place at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> i was required to take a funeral service and when a week or two ago i put my <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government not be inclined to agree that when this particular criticism is raised it has much more to do with left-wing politics than politics in general and that the objection that the clergy should not be involved in politics is generally assumed to mean that they would be all right if they were right-wing but if they indulge in left-wing politics that is suspicious and probably dubious <e>", "<cs> my lords it so happens that this debate coincides in time with the flurry of re-interest in the question as to whether the clergy should involve themselves in politics <e> <s> i suggest that a reading of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been engaged this day in two debates in your lordships house which have one issue in common just as i believe that war is unjustifiable so finally do i believe that the prison system is irremediable <e> <s> therefore i take an absolute view of the prison system <e> <s> though i recognise the difference that whereas clausewitz regards war as a continuation of policy we are confronted with policy as the very essence of the prison system as it now prevails <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be grateful to my noble friend for introducing a topic upon which his own assertion was that it ought to stimulate thought and i dare say that a great deal of thought has already been stimulated on the very wide issues that are involved in this motion <e> <s> i am persuaded i was almost going to say <e> <s> stung into <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my felicitations to those already offered to the noble marquess on his maiden speech <e> <s> if he will allow me to say so it was well presented and well documented and i hope as the house does that we shall hear him speak with equal

human misery of unemployment <e> <s> i do not intend to generate a head of emotional steam particularly in a short speech <e> <s> but i would share with the house my anger rather than my sentimental approach to this problem and would seek to promote a sense of anger among those members of your lordships house who may not i speak i hope without impertinence be aware of some of the more dreadful aspects of unemployment as i had to face them though not because i have been unemployed with the present level of original sin i am in no dire difficulty there <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege to be the first to felicitate the noble viscount on his maiden speech <e> <s> i do so with alacrity and with gratitude for the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my words of congratulation to the noble lord lord grenfell on his maiden speech <e> <s> how excellently he caught the temper and spirit of what this debate ought to be about <e> <s> i reflect that it is no intrusion when we who belong to the cloth represent it in moral terms <e> <s> i shall not however endeavour to burnish the shield already so clearly lifted up by my noble friend the right reverend prelate <e> <s> in the short space of time which is available to us i shall recollect that this particular debate falls into two parts <e>", "<cs> my lords in approaching even in a short debate a problem of such enormous import i propose if i may to set it within the categories of numbers and thereafter before i sit down to try to say something about the moral and the spiritual setting as well <e> <s> i will quote from the statement given by shelter in <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment because i believe that this bill unamended will do great damage both to the financial situation and indeed to the more shall we say spiritual characteristics of the voluntary services <e> <s> i have not been in any way reinforced in any opposition to that view by what has been said this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords the discussion is about the relevance of violence in the contemporary system and particularly in education <e> <s> i wish i could speak authoritatively and ecumenically for the christian churches <e> <s> i cannot do that <e> <s> i had hoped that at the methodist conference which is now in session i could have produced a motion but they were too busy concerning themselves with the dubious habits of freemasons and the opportunity did not arise <e> <s> however i do not think it would be imprudent of me to say that i represent an overwhelming consensus in the christian churches today that everything that can be done to reduce the element of violence in the contemporary society should be undertaken as a matter of primary opportunity and of primary concern <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i to a certain extent can sympathise with the last speaker <e> <s> he is in great trouble it seems to me because he has not appreciated that this is principally a matter of the moral law from which the application of statute law must necessarily be stipendiary <e> <s> i want heartily to support the intention behind this bill notably because it can be modified i dare say in committee but also because it represents something which in part is of the substance of what i believe this country and all the people who are concerned with justice should approve and should seek to make possible in legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my congratulations to those that have already been offered to the noble lord lord mellish on his maiden speech <e> <s> i think he will understand me if i say that knowing him i am not at all surprised that it was such a very good one <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to support the amendment and in the first instance i am concerned to say a few words about the representative nature of the amendment as proposed by the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham <e> <s> he spoke <e>", "<cs> my lords i dare say that the last speaker would include in his indictment of the bishops also members of the free churches which gives me the opportunity of saving that there has been a burgeoning opposition to this bill over the past few weeks which i take to be significant and for which in one sense i am rather grateful because it has brought the free churches together in what is an unexampled and unprecedented way in recent times <e>", "<cs> my lords i am almost irresistibly attracted to a discussion on voluntary organisations <e> <s> i have been mixed up with them for most of my adult life and i am the more grateful therefore to my noble friend for introducing this topic today and for the prospects which i think increase with each speech of some kind of constructive result <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have the actual title of it i will write to the noble lord and let him know what it is <e> <s> however i am quite sure of the facts that i produced and that they are well justified <e>", "<cs> my lords as this stage of the debate i shall avoid with great care rehearsing issues which have already been ventilated with considerable enthusiasm and the general opposition from this side of the house to the action of the american president i cordially support <e> <s> what i shall do if it is not a presumption is to select three areas which belong to the circumstances surrounding as invariably circumstances do the action of the american president as they have come to me in contact with the man in the street with whom i am not unacquainted and the first is this

pattern of what i believe to be an accurate and comprehensive view of the kind of society in which we are living today <e> <s> it was all the more impressive it seems to me because of the failure of the immediately succeeding speaker to produce a sermon after he had taken due care to read the collect for the day <e> <s> i believe that the collect for the day was set forth admirably by the noble lord lord wells-pestell <e> <s> it is something upon which as a methodist preacher i would humbly suggest that your lordships should properly listen to my testimony <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege and pleasure to be the first to congratulate the noble lord lord beaverbrook on his maiden speech and to assure him that when he remembers it he will think of it more auspiciously than ever

prepared as that to which we have listened from him today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the speaker who has just sat down because he has given me a text for what i have to say <e> <s> i shall undertake to be brief albeit at the expense of perhaps being unduly dogmatic <e> <s> i find that there are two professional statements that need to be made from my point of view <e> <s> the first is that apartheid is itself sinful and a particular kind of sin that is to say it is original because it is sin within an establishment which is committed principally to that sin rather than occasional to which we are all committed some of us more regularly than others <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that there is a fundamental problem nestling in this question <e> <s> does she not agree that there is a world of difference between religious education and religious worship <e> <s> as i see it those who are technically <e>", "<cs> my lords in commending this measure to your lordships house i think i am in a position to say that that measure of approval will receive enthusiastic support within the free churches <e> <s> such evidence as comes to mind asserts that fact and would confirm that the more we know about it the more likely we are to think of it as a very good thing indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by offering my congratulations to the noble lord lord derwent for a maiden speech which i found most cogent and enterprising <e> <s> if the noble lord will allow me to pay him a compliment i begin with the claim that he made <e> <s> it is important to look upon this affair in our chamber today from the outside <e> <s> as is my wont i have been talking in the open air today <e> <s> it was a bit damp but i found there a reaction in great contrast to the general temper and spirit of the debate hitherto in your lordships house <e> <s> the main difference it seems to me from contact with the outsider is that for him <e>", "<cs> my lords of all the elements in the speech of the noble and learned lord lord scarman for which i am grateful none is more conspicuous than his penultimate comment that here is an imperative need and that it is our business as best we can to seek to provide some measure of encouragement that the need will be met <e> <s> i believe that this is the function of the debate and i should like to contribute something towards that end <e>", "<cs> if he was a lay preacher he was not entitled to wear the collar <e>", "<cs> my lords i am attracted to the motion on the order paper for a number of reasons not least that it takes place at a time when there is obviously movement in the international sphere <e> <s> that is true not only in russia as regards which it would be excellent if we tried to support the russian situation as it is now developing but also in the chaos which is likely to emerge on the other side of the atlantic <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin with congratulations on my own part on the maiden speech of the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> it was admirable and if i may say so one of erudition and warmth and i am sure that the house will be in his debt on many occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn for indicating the response which is required in the light of the events of the past two or three days <e> <s> i am glad that he set the pattern in indicating that that response must be a co-operative effort in order to secure the fruits of what is obviously a new summer <e> <s> it is a fruitful time if we know how to use the changes which have now taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be particularly grateful for the speech of the noble lord lord ross of newport on two counts and perhaps on many more <e> <s> those two counts are the historic setting in which he put the case to which we are directing our attention now and the sense of crisis which infused what he had to say <e> <s> i shall begin with the latter point <e> <s> i regard the situation as unnecessarily deplorable and as one that demands a radical approach if any permanent solution is to be attained <e>", "<cs> i oppose the clause <e>", "<cs> i oppose this clause for reasons which i shall define briefly <e> <s> at the outset i shall confess the difficulties which confront anyone endeavouring to approach the matter from a christian point of view <e> <s> in the absence of my ministerial and other friends except for one i am glad to see we are in great difficulty from the christian standpoint and we had better confess that <e>",

teetotaller <e> <s> i was brought up to believe that alcohol is the devil in solution <e> <s> i no longer hold that view and i am not going to argue the teetotal case <e> <s> neither am i prepared to argue that essentially the christian point of view should be adduced as a reason for the total closing of such premises on sundays <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the evangelical fervour and scholarship that he has demonstrated in your lordships house today is extremely acceptable to many of us who would desire a greater attention to the inner meaning of easter whether it falls on a particular date or not <e> <s> we would desire to commend that spirit of anticipation because we believe the celebration of easter as the culmination and fulfilment of the promise of god is of the utmost importance for our own welfare <e>", "<cs> the methodist church agrees entirely with the amendments proposed by the right reverend prelate the bishop of london <e>", "<cs> i am irresistibly attracted to this amendment <e> <s> without it the framework of the curriculum is flawed and imperfect in as much as it takes little account of the content of the speech to which we have

<e> <s> in my first ministry in i repaired to an open-air site called tower hill <e> <s> i offered myself for such questions as might be asked feeling furnished with adequate answers in terms of the education that i had received <e> <s> the first question i was asked was about karl marx i had never heard of him <e> <s> i had perhaps heard the name but if so it had passed through my mind <e> <s> it had not lodged there <e> <s> i told the heckler that his was a difficult question that i did not want to give a hasty answer and that i would respond the following week <e> <s> i have been endeavouring to continue that conversation ever since <e> <s> my confidence that the amendment is necessary is confirmed by that experience <e> <s> it revealed to me that without the commitment to the wider issues of a world which changes so fundamentally and so dangerously almost in the blinking of an eye all education must necessarily be flawed <e>", "<cs> i attach no emphasis whatever to my own personal conviction in this particular regard which is that the advocacy of the christian faith is for me dominant and imperative <e> <s> but i want to support what has been said by my ecclesiastical and noble friend the right reverend prelate the bishop of london because i believe the preempting of the issue at this moment would be disastrous <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that one of the contributory factors to the suggested factual increase is what might be called the mobility of alcohol <e> <s> alcohol consumed more or less in a sedentary condition and at specified times is one thing but does not the carrying around of alcohol in beer cans and the mobility provided by the motor cycle and the car have a good deal to do with the vast increase particularly in rural areas

experience over the years and i believe that the increase has much to do with the increased opportunity of drinking during all hours of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords in declaring an interest which has tended to wane somewhat during the last five minutes may i ask the government whether they will distinguish in any deliberations on <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by reminding myself immediately of the

his comments and indeed by the attitude behind the comments which if i may say so without impudence i found most encouraging <e> <s> we hope that he will enrich debates in the future as he has done today <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful for this public airing of a most difficult and complicated topic <e> <s> i am the more grateful paradoxically to the noble lord who initiated the debate in that he demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt how stupid in many respects the present position is and how demanding it is of some renovation if it is to be a reasonable attitude of mind and to be incorporated into some kind of legal and administrative process <e>", "<cs> my lords the presence of my name on the list of speakers is not due to arty particular information about bradford that

of comments which are the product of almost a lifetime of involvement in these matters <e> <s> two of them of a general nature must be borne in mind for any effective contemplation of the role that they should play and the contribution that they can make <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to oppose the amendment and take a text which seems to me to be apposite and immediate <e> <s> the warnock committee accorded a special status to the early human conceptus as they described it implying that its use for non-therapeutic research required strong moral justification <e> <s> i shall address myself to that strong moral justification which lies behind the comments that have already been made and the various claims that have been asserted <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that
