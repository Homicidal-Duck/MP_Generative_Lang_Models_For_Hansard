["<cs> my lords i rise with great diffidence to address your lordships house for the first time and i crave your customary indulgence <e> <s> i have spent my entire career being an expert of sorts and experts of any sort are characterised first by their abysmal ignorance of all matters outside their own expertise and secondly by their tendency to be controversial about any subject whether or not they know anything about it <e> <s> there are therefore very few subjects for debate in your lordships house upon which i am competent to speak in a non-controversial way <e> <s> my choice of occasion being so severely constrained i very greatly welcome the opportunity provided for me by the noble lord lord kings norton in introducing this short debate for i am confident that there can be little controversy about the assertion that there has been a deterioration in the use of the english langague <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak not on behalf of the council but as perhaps a very large-scale user of the services of the british council <e> <s> for years the open university has been a focus of interest for the educational authorities of well over nations <e> <s> there has been a tremendous surge of interest in distance-learning systems of which the open university is a prototype <e> <s> so we have been called upon to provide advice materials and know-how in many lands <e> <s> sometimes the initial contact has been made through the activities of the british council <e> <s> sometimes direct contact has been made and the follow-up has been channelled through the british council <e> <s> in all cases we have found the offices and representatives of the council helpful and often we have found them quite invaluable <e> <s> their knowledge political and demographic of the local educational scene has made our task much easier <e> <s> however perhaps more important than that is that we have tried to provide those services that advice and those materials on a commercial basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am no engineer and i will not at this hour spend any time on the detailed proposals educational or otherwise in the report <e> <s> i should like only to emphasise two messages which i think are implicit in it <e> <s> the first is that as a nation we are ultimately dependent upon our engineers for our prosperity <e> <s> the second which is in my view just as important is that as a nation we have consistently undervalued our engineers <e> <s> we have accorded to them as noble lords have said the status of only second-class citizens <e> <s> this cannot be corrected by improving the education of our engineers or by a reorganisation of the structure of the profession <e> <s> it can only be corrected by educating the public <e> <s> it is moreover a task that in england is a formidably difficult one because of the backdrop of history <e>", "<cs> my lords having battled for some years with my friends at the bbc over the need of the open university for decent air times may i reinforce what has already been said by the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> the pressure on the university to release time for other programmes appealing to larger audiences than it can possibly muster is wholly understandable and eminently reasonable <e> <s> it has also been continuous pressure <e> <s> the advent of the fourth channel will quite inevitably intensify that pressure and i think it will deal a very heavy blow at the open university <e> <s> competition for the ratings between the fourth channel and bbc is bound to occur <e> <s> the one depends upon advertisers for its income and they demand an audience the other exists upon licence fees and must justify its costs <e> <s> the open university will not <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a word or two in support of this amendment <e> <s> this bill creates a fourth television channel in britain <e> <s> it will not only create a new service that will try to be different from the three existing services but will also quite inevitably have profound effects on the other three channels <e> <s> that is my first and major contention <e> <s> i believe that the effects will be maximal on bbc <e> <s> competition for audience ratings has so far been mainly between bbc and iba bbc has been relatively free to cater for minority audiences <e> <s> i suggest that when the fourth channel starts competition will be between bbc plus bbc on the one hand and iba plus iba on the other hand <e> <s> this will be forced by economic reality whatever high-minded ideals the authorities may hold <e> <s> thus the effects of this bill will be much more wide-reaching than its influence just on the fourth channel <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord banks for putting down this motion <e> <s> i share the view of mr david steel that what we need is a shared national strategy and i should like to say a word or two about the motion which stresses the need for action <e> <s> i confess that i have little expectation that this call for action will be heeded by the government <e> <s> when i took my seat in this house i chose to occupy a cross-bench <e> <s> had never been a member of any political party and in the last general election i confess that i almost welcomed the fact of being in common with criminals lunatics and your lordships disenfranchised <e> <s> however i was not proud of my indecision and indeed was rather shamefaced about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i will keep your lordships only a moment or two but i should like to make two points <e> <s> the noble lord lord ritchie-calder has said all that i might have said about fees for the open university except one thing <e> <s> he said that the number of applications had held up remarkably well over the last two or three years and it has <e> <s> but that crude statistic hides a remarkable number of subtle differences because among the applicants there has been a dramatic fall in those who come from the north-east from wales and from scotland whereas there has been an increase in those coming from the south-east <e> <s> secondly there has been a fall in those coming from the deprived classes and an increase in those coming from the middle classes so a crude statistic of that sort is not the whole story <e> <s> that is all i want to say about my first point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly sure we must all be perfectly sure that this bill has been actuated by the purest of motives <e> <s> the need to avoid patients being treated by over-tired doctors and the need to safeguard the health of doctors are admirable motives for any bill <e> <s> the dilemma is that the two problems are not new and that they are not amenable to legislation <e> <s> to attempt to legislate is asking for trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley for choosing this subject for debate <e> <s> the motion before the house draws attention to three different issues all of them of the greatest importance <e> <s> that there is an urgent need for a better educated working population and indeed for an educated population as a whole is i imagine a claim to which all of your lordships would subscribe <e>", "<cs> yes my lords those initials stand for council for national academic awards <e> <s> at the open university the minimum cost of an honours degree is and over the past two years this has been increased by government forces by per cent <e> <s> the maximum fee for an honours degree in science and technology is no less than <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hunter painted on a very broad canvas a comprehensive picture of the development of the nhs <e> <s> as one who has never worked in that service i shall try to paint only a very small miniature <e> <s> but since i shall be rather critical of some aspects of it i feel it only right that i should make it plain at the outset that i consider the nhs to be one of the really glorious achievements of post-war britain <e> <s> if it did not eliminate the fear of being ill it at least eliminated the fear of the economic consequences of being ill <e> <s> it has throughout its life offered a consistently high standard of care <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead for initiating this debate for although i wish to speak on only one matter it is i believe of some importance <e> <s> i refer to the relationship of copyright ownership to education <e> <s> the nature of the educational process has been changing and will continue to change very fast because of the explosive growth of communications technology <e> <s> it may still be true that education requires only a teacher a student and possibly a blackboard but it is no longer practicable on a large scale <e> <s> teaching materials as aids in the process are already common <e> <s> books have after all been with us for a long <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my first and pleasant duty to congratulate on behalf of noble lords in all parts of the house the noble lord lord rea on a very notable and erudite maiden speech <e> <s> it is a particular pleasure for me to welcome another medical man into this house and to note the happy coincidence that i am welcoming another medical man who shares with me experience in nigeria <e> <s> i am sure we all look forward to hearing him on many future occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i largely share the views of the noble lord lord glenamara about the erosion of educational opportunities that we have seen under the present government and i too see adverse effects on our national economy arising as a result <e> <s> i have said on previous occasions in this house all that i really have to say about the ruthless and largely indiscriminate cuts in the educational resources that they have made and i have nothing to add on that today <e> <s> however i wish to say something very particular about continuing education <e>", "<cs> neither provided any encouragement any leadership for continuing education and that my lords is a far worse condemnation <e> <s> i recognise that central government cannot directly control education which is a local responsibility <e> <s> but it is their job to provide leadership <e> <s> in my experience they have shown great timidity and i fear that has been because of their fear of offending the professional associations unions and local authorities <e>", "<cs> that is the real lesson we must learn from the present mess my lords and that is why we very badly need a change of direction and a change of party in power <e>", "<cs> i was referring to continuing education my lords not the whole of education <e>", "<cs> my lords we all agree that there is clearly a need to improve conditions of service in the national health service but which conditions are most in need of improvement <e> <s> i wish to emphasise only one point <e> <s> there is an abundance of evidence that morale among all grades of staff is low <e> <s> there are many reasons for this some of which have been mentioned and no doubt they vary greatly between grades of staff and between places <e> <s> but despite the recent industrial dispute i think that rates of pay in themselves are not the most important <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that discretionary grants have become progressively more difficult for students to get because of the pressure on the finances of local authorities <e> <s> is he also aware that it lies within the power of the government to extend the system of mandatory grants to the part-time students of the open university <e> <s> could he give us the reasons why the government have consistently not met this request of the students of the open university <e>", "<cs> proving damage from the unauthorised disclosure of medical records would be extraordinarily difficult and stressful for the majority of patients and would effectively discredit the concept of data protection in this way <e> <s> would the noble and learned lord consider the possibility of having a penalty imposed for unauthorised disclosure alone without recourse to asking for damages <e> <s> that would not prevent an action for damages being taken in addition <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask a connected question <e> <s> it seems to me that the wording of the clause does not state specifically that the nature of the third party shall be disclosed <e> <s> if it states simply that the data have been received from a third party there will be no ability to go back to the original data supplier <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord very much <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating what the noble and learned lord said may i ask whether the government would be prepared to differentiate between the third parties to whom he has referred and third parties where there is a transfer of information from one computer file to another <e> <s> that is the danger that i see in the absence of an amendment of this sort <e> <s> it does not seem very difficult to flag a computer with an indication that there is a particular part of the file which has been obtained from the computer file of another data user <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to most of the debates at all stages of the bill i very much regret that i find little reason to change my view that despite the changes made the bill is not only difficult but also essentially bad <e> <s> the government have steadfastly maintained that the main objective of the bill is the protection of the privacy of the individual but throughout the debates they have resisted almost all attempts so to amend the bill as to more adequately achieve that objective <e>", "<cs> my lords may i continue or am i out of order <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it difficult to do so <e> <s> in the circumstances i think that i had better sit down <e>", "<cs> we on these benches support these amendments but we are debating first of all amendment no <e> <s> and i should like to ask the government not to consider all amendments together because amendment no <e> <s> simply asks for the appointment of a council <e> <s> it leaves complete freedom as to the nature of that council unless the further amendments are accepted together with it <e> <s> i would therefore suggest that the government accept amendment no <e> <s> and bring forward at report stage their own proposals to be debated at that time about the nature and shape of the council if they cannot agree to the rest of the amendments today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord annan not only for initiating this debate but also for saying things that i believe badly needed saying and i should like to reinforce his arguments <e> <s> i listened with a great deal of interest to my noble friend lord flowers who spoke with great fluency about the changes that have already taken place in the universities <e> <s> of course he is absolutely right they have moved a very long way much further than i ever thought they would <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour for raising this very important issue <e> <s> like many other noble lords i find the objectives of the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for giving us this opportunity to debate again the problems of running the national health service <e> <s> the present government have a remarkable record of diagnostic skills <e> <s> once again they have come to a <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to make only one point in this crowded debate the expansion of adult education and continuing education <e> <s> but first of all i must mention how extraordinarily heartwarming i find it to listen to so many noble lords from every side of the house paying such compliments to the open university where i spent so many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to provide for the establishment and functions of a national development council for continuing education and training <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord harris of greenwich painted a graphic picture of the drug scene and i can add only that it has been confirmed to me over the past few weeks from many sources ranging from senior medical men to recovered addicts <e> <s> all share in the recognition of the almost epidemic spread of heroin misuse <e> <s> all share in the knowledge that most misusers misuse more than one drug <e> <s> all share in the belief that misuse is more of a sickness than a sign of moral weakness and all share in the opinion that facilities for coping are woefully inadequate <e> <s> they do not agree at all about what are the best facilities <e> <s> many dedicated altruists doing yeoman work in the field are convinced that their method is best yet none can produce chapter and verse or scientific evidence to support that belief <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by apologising in advance to the house because i have to leave before the end of the debate <e> <s> this is because i have to catch a train <e> <s> may i also say that i have listened to my noble friend lord kilmarnock to the noble lord lord ennals and to the noble lord lord porritt and i have agreed with every single word that they have said from beginning to end <e> <s> i do not want to say it all over again probably much less well than they have already said it but there are one or two aspects of generic substitution about which i want to say a word because i can claim to speak with a little authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the parliament act <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> he could tell you i now see that the noble lord is here i beg his pardon and he will no doubt tell you from personal experience of the glc that such things can happen <e> <s> and those who made them happen there can and do stand for election to this parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking all those who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i should also like to thank the many noble lords who wrote to me expressing support but who were unable to be here <e> <s> there is only one comment that i have heard tonight that has made me wish to change anything and that is the remarks of the noble and learned lord lord silkin about the intervening general election <e> <s> i should be happy to see an amendment made to the bill to the effect that five years and one day would only hold if there had not been a general election in the meanwhile <e> <s> i had overlooked that possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall confine myself this afternoon to a few words about the current state of continuing education and i shall do that for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that it is of growing importance to the nation <e> <s> secondly it is because i happen at the moment to be chairman of the standing committee on continuing education that was set up last year by the joint action of the university grants committee the national advisory body for higher education and the open university <e> <s> our task is to keep under review all the provision of continuing education at the higher education level in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall confine my remarks to a consideration of those clauses in the bill which relate to the ways in which educational establishments are permitted to use copyright material for teaching and research <e> <s> the intention of making special provision for educational needs is admirable but the practice as currently defined falls perhaps a little short of that standard and i hope that it can be suitably amended at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to the house as i very much regret that i shall not be able to stay to the end of this fascinating debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> can he say what further public expenditure will be incurred by the development corporation in destroying much of the amenity in constructing the h portway road extension across the centre of willen lake against the expressed wishes of more than <e>", "<cs> local inhabitants <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the volume of public protest is the minister willing to request the development corporation to delay what i understand is the imminent beginning to construction of the road so that alternative arrangements can now be looked at <e> <s> is he aware that the change of attitude in milton keynes is already very great <e>", "<cs> my lords the national health service has not suddenly developed an acute illness it has as the noble lord lord winstanley said been chronically sick for years <e> <s> recent events represent only the worsening of the condition <e> <s> there is no question that a shortage of money is a factor in causing the recent deterioration <e> <s> however shortage of money did not cause the disease it merely aggravated the symptoms <e> <s> providing more money would improve the patient <e> <s> however that would be only symptomatic treatment <e> <s> that is not to say that symptomatic treatment is not important <e> <s> it is very important and more money is certainly needed <e> <s> however it would not provide a radical cure <e>", "<cs> my lords we are dealing with a great reform bill which is going to have profound effects on the mechanism of education <e> <s> i find it disturbing that it has so little to say about education itself <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady david said it starts off with clause which is wholly unexceptionable <e> <s> there must be <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that the rectors assessor is responsible for reporting back only to the rector not to the student body <e> <s> that puts him in a totally different position from student representatives appointed by the student body <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for that explanation <e> <s> before withdrawing the amendments i should like to make one point on each of them <e> <s> first the fear that is rampant in many quarters in the academic and research worlds is not that the funding councils will define acceptable academic standards for the universities but that they will not fund the universities at a level that the universities decide is academically adequate or that other people will so decide <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the debate nearly everything that i wanted to say has been said <e> <s> i think that i am the seventh member of the select committee to speak <e> <s> my splendid chairman the noble lord lord nelson and my other colleagues have said nothing with which i have disagreed and i have listened to them all this afternoon <e> <s> therefore i shall not attempt any further detailed analysis <e> <s> i should simply like to emphasise one or two points among the major ones in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords as the open university has been mentioned i should make it perfectly plain that although it does not receive money from the university grants committee it is subject to the comptroller and auditor generals scrutiny <e> <s> its accounts are so subject and they are answerable to the public accounts committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to know that the government share my commitment <e> <s> it is perfectly true that it ought to be the case that continuing education should share a place equal to that of initial education <e> <s> the hard facts are that <e>"]
