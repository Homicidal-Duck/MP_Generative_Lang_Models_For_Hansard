["<cs> my lords i crave the indulgence of the house <e> <s> i imagine that any normal maiden speaker rises in this house with a burning desire to sit down again <e> <s> on this occasion the very long list of those waiting to speak gives me an exceptionally good excuse <e> <s> i almost went on to say i am not the man to look a gift excuse in the mouth but this is not the right debate for that sort of talk <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> does the noble lord appreciate that the temporary barricades activate parkinsons law which in this context states that a queue expands laterally to take up that large proportion of the pavement allocated to it by the barricade <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that on tuesday there was a mass lobby by metal box employees on which occasion for once the barricades were not used <e> <s> finally is the noble lord aware that the consequence of that was that the queue having been left largely to its own devices formed up virtually in single file which seemed to be better for everybody and especially better because safer for the long-suffering police constables <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> does he appreciate that my concern is for the police constables whom i see standing out in the traffic for reasons which still seem to me inadequate <e> <s> does he appreciate that this is directly related to the excessive amount of space taken up by these queues <e> <s> so long as there is such a wide queue there will be police constables standing in the traffic <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord noticed that one never sees a woman driving in the manner about which the noble viscount very rightly complained but that it always seems to be a particular kind of man who clearly regards the right-hand lane as a virility symbol <e> <s> therefore will he consider a publicity campaign in which men popularly supposed to be virile will appear on posters or possibly on television proclaiming that they in fact drive on the left <e> <s> finally is the noble lord aware that although i have five children and am therefore technically qualified for this role the kind of man whom i seriously put forward is mr sean connery <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> would it not however be much better in every way and for everybody if trade unions could conduct their inquiries without conveying the strong impression that they are desperately anxious to get to the witness first and indeed to prevent other people from getting there first <e>", "<cs> my lords unless my watch has stopped which i do not think it has it is time that we pedants began to congratulate ourselves upon our exemplary brevity so unlike those who previously debated the comparatively minor matter of gibraltar <e> <s> therefore in order to keep my vow to be always one of the briefest speakers i shall cut down my speech <e> <s> it gives me no pleasure to intervene in the noble and learned lords debate and totally to disagree with him <e> <s> i can only hope that he will shrug his shoulders and say well with enemies like ailesbury who needs friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> if these agreements can be broken with impunity as clearly happened in the case to which he kindly gave me a helpful written answer on th february that does not exactly encourage the others to stick to their agreements as they surely should <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord crawshaw because this is the first time i have dared to attempt a second reading speech <e> <s> but unfortunately i am not sure that too much gratitude is going to manifest itself in this speech <e> <s> i am reminded of that sad little wartime story to the effect that when luftwaffe came over the british troops got into dugouts and put on tin hats <e> <s> when the raf planes came over the germans got into dugouts and put on tin hats <e> <s> when the american air force appeared everybody got into dugouts and put on tin hats <e> <s> i am afraid i reach hastily for my own tin hat when i see politicians overflying this particular area <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask a question not unlike that standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> a vital word has been omitted from the order paper not i think by me <e> <s> my question should relate not to motorists but to innocent motorists <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply but ought not the preliminary test be to eliminate the innocent and thus protect them from being arrested <e> <s> is it not failing to an unacceptable extent to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that when i wished to place a fairly simple matter before the parliamentary ombudsman the advice that i received was that it would be a total waste of time as it would take from three to five months to obtain an opinion <e> <s> now that the minister is aware of that does it not seem to him that a quite admirable concept is being rendered far from admirable in practice through being starved of the necessary resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> however does he appreciate that some of us who support the principle of the community charge namely that every individual should contribute towards the cost of services regret the abandonment of that principle in this area <e>"]
