["<cs> my lords may i endorse the remarks of the noble baroness in regard to the excellent and instructive speech which we have heard from the noble lord <e> <s> lord carver <e> <s> in the course of hearing many maiden speeches over a long time i have rarely heard if at all a speech which has contained such knowledge and experience as the noble lord has displayed to us both today and by his previous help towards a country in whose activities he has participated <e> <s> i am quite certain that everyone in this house will look forward with the greatest pleasure to hearing him again often in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to take into consideration and with other civilised people deal as effectively as he possibly can with the terrible acts that are taking place at the present time against people particularly in the ussr where for example a woman named ida nudel has been exiled to siberia has been put in a hut with criminals and with no other women about and is being quite unlawfully detained <e> <s> will he see to that and other cases of people in both the ussr and other countries in view of the fact that there are considerable breaches at present of the helsinki agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the answer he has given but may i ask whether he is aware i am sure he is that there are still many people making applications and being refused and in some cases being sent to mental hospitals in order to be given treatment which is terrible and most degrading <e> <s> is he further aware that as my noble friend lord wells-pestell said the ussr is in the view of many of us sensitive to criticism from abroad of a public nature particularly now when the olympic games are about to be played <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name of the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> will he be good enough to investigate once more the plo which has claimed responsibility for example for an incident in nahariyya very recently in which a child of four was shot in the head and afterwards hit on the head its skull being bashed in with the butt of a rifle <e> <s> will the noble lord realise that in incidents of this kind the plo is claiming responsibility and that it is an international gangster movement <e> <s> will he please investigate the position now and see to it that the plos office here is not maintained <e> <s> the organisation is acting not only against israel or any other country but also against ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> are the government aware that actions of the kind taken by my noble friend have resulted in entire misrepresentation of the situation so far as the incident at the king david hotel is concerned for example <e> <s> i might direct my noble friends attention to my reference to this matter the day before yesterday <e> <s> would he please understand that the plo with its affiliates is a danger to the civilisation of the world and that in so far as our own country is concerned the plo office is either itself or through affiliates connected with those who are attacking our soldiers and forces in ulster <e>", "<cs> my lords may i as one who was involved at the time of the mosley difficulties in the east end of london ask the noble lord whether the lesson has not yet been learned of what should be and what should not be allowed in the interests of freedom <e> <s> there are many people who are considerably perturbed by the fact that among those who are in the national front at present are people who were actually in the mosley movement when he was perpetrating some of the most serious actions against liberty when they were against the policy of the government altogether and when they were pro-nazi as obviously the national front is at present <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that it is so serious a matter that it ought to be dealt with as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord first a question on the refugees <e> <s> while i appreciate and i am sure everybody here appreciates the approach that has been made to the ussr the fact still remains that there are very many refugees who unhappily are without any place of refuge at all <e> <s> will the government consider approaching the various governments of the world with a view to doing what israel for example has done a small state like that to look after a proportion of the refugees who are still in dire peril on the seas <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords present will have realised by now that there are some difficulties in regard to this bill <e> <s> however in the main we should consider what the effect of the introduction of the bill will be whether or not it passes its second reading <e> <s> i am bound to say that as someone who has been involved in this matter for some sixty years i find it difficult to make a final decision on the bill <e> <s> let me say at once that i can think of no one who has been in any way connected with this problem and who has not felt that the victims should certainly be entitled to proper compensation <e> <s> i have never heard anyone say such a thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that if i may say so rather unsatisfactory reply in view of the fact that this has been <e>", "<cs> my lords may i again make an appeal to the minister to speed this up <e> <s> because this is part of what i call the blackmoiling carried on against decent reasonable nations like our own in order to make them party to what is an absurd thing that is the boycott of one of their allies a people with whom we have diplomatic relations <e> <s> it is a shocking thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the hour is very late <e> <s> consequently one has to compress what one has to say into a few short sentences <e> <s> first may i compliment and thank the noble lord lord alport for having asked this unstarred question <e> <s> i should like to speak about many of the matters which have been raised but time is not available <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply but may i ask him when he examines what happened at that very high powered meeting at which the noble lord lord chalfont and also the right honourable merlyn rees and sir hugh fraser were present to be good enough to look at that speech and to see whether or not he can pursue the lines which were put out there <e> <s> for example the press the media the bbc are utilising terms which our government should take some steps about since they describe one set of people as guerrillas and the others as terrorists <e> <s> they call guerrillas such a movement as the plo which contributes both by itself and by means of its affiliated gangsters towards attacking the people of this country through the ira who are carrying on gangster warfare <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for the reply which he gave to the question in view of the terrible situation being created by the national front the holding of <e>", "<cs> my lord while thanking the noble lord for the replies he has given and the excellent example that is being set by him and the government and the country generally in respect of this matter may i ask whether he can inform the house if any other countries have taken action of a similar nature and whether we have made approaches before the actual meeting in geneva to see if we can get some of our friends for example in the eec and others to do something similar <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a simple question <e> <s> while thanking the government for the excellent services in respect of this conference may i ask what steps are being taken at present to see to it that those who are considering the helsinki agreement shall at the next meeting have the fullest possible information about the decisions of this particular conference <e> <s> will an attempt be made to make them realise that there are certain sections of it against which some of them are committing grievous errors and to try to get them to understand what civilised people really want <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether he has examined how the various nations apart from ourselves have contributed and how particularly the oil-producing nations who are making fortunes at the present time contribute towards not only other refugees but those whom they themselves call refugees <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord inform the house for how many years this fund has been held up <e> <s> the charities which are very well deserving need the money <e> <s> when he meets the brewers society again will he explain why this matter has taken so many years <e> <s> how many more years is it going to take before the charities benefit from the fund <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it extremely difficult as a layman to express adequately the admiration i have for those noble lords who have spoken already particularly the professional ones who understand this subject inside out <e> <s> i ask your lordships forgiveness for intervening for a few moments as a layman <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble earl lord halsbury for having given us the opportunity of speaking and of hearing him on this subject <e> <s> most people are deeply concerned about how animals are treated but i think that very few if any would deny that it is important in some way and perhaps in many ways for experiments to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree <e> <s> i hope they will read the book which has been produced which contains very full information about it but i do not want my noble friend to think for one moment that i was in any way deprecating those who are in the scientific world <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will allow me to make just one remark on that point <e> <s> the experiments to which i referred needed no experimentation on animals at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say on behalf of my profession that we are extremely obliged for the advances that are being made in this <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with those noble lords who have spoken so far in thanking the noble lord lord montagu of beaulieu for having introduced this matter because in my opinion by so doing he has done an extremely valuable service to us on a subject in which many of us have had an interest from time to time <e> <s> i should like to add that noble lords who have spoken so far have certainly covered much of the ground that i had desired to cover <e> <s> therefore i am not proposing to keep the house for any great length of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not farcical that although the rent acts are <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord think again about this matter <e> <s> does he realise that people who have lived in their homes for or years and i have in mind in particular pensioners who rely entirely upon a fixed pension are being driven from their homes <e> <s> the result is terrifying and the acts do not protect them <e> <s> will the noble lord go into the matter carefully and ensure that something like the leasehold reform act or a proper rent act <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for what he said may i ask if he would not agree that we are really succumbing to blackmail which i call blackmail against a people the israeli people with whom a favourable balance of trade has continued for many years <e> <s> are we not treating that customer an old customer shamefully <e> <s> will the noble lord please study what the dutch government have done in regard to these certificates <e> <s> will he be good enough to explain to those who approach him with a view to succumbing to that form of blackmoil that the united states have passed anti-boycott laws yet trade with the arab countries concerned has increased vastly in spite of it <e> <s> why cannot we do the same <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put a last question to the noble lord <e> <s> will he be good enough to study the position with regard to the american situation <e> <s> is he aware that none of the fears that were expressed when the anti-boycott legislation was under consideration have been justified and that instead trade has increased very considerably <e> <s> is he further aware that at the present time most of the arab world is not included in the boycott and that we have nothing to fear from blackmail any more <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow up that point for a moment <e> <s> while everybody appreciates that our magistrates are extremely useful important and knowledgeable people there are some cases in which it is not brought home at the court itself and that is what the noble viscount is referring to that a person is entitled to compensation <e> <s> this is really his point so far as i can see it <e> <s> if there are such cases as those to which he has referred perhaps the home office will issue a circular or something of that nature to ask magistrates to point out that compensation may be claimed whenever a case of that description arises <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl consult or join with countries which have already provided very important fish ponds particularly israel as regards the potential of this particular system of providing food and how successful it can be and will he act accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that this particular institute is highly respected not only in this country but throughout the world <e> <s> is he further aware that it has afforded an example to other places throughout the world and that any attempt to reduce its activities would be regarded as being quite contrary to general opinion throughout the world <e> <s> in those circumstances will he see to it that the ward to which he referred will be restored as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that reply may i ask him whether he will specifically bring to the notice of the ussr the fact of their disgraceful shocking articles books and so on which are very reminiscent of the nazi methods and the publication of which must be stopped <e> <s> secondly will he be good enough to bring to their notice the fact that this anti-semitism is carried very much further in many directions <e> <s> one example concerns moscow university and applicants for admission from six leading moscow high schools of high repute in the scientific world <e> <s> of the jewish applicants graduates from the schools for the mathematics faculty were given six places and of those only two were registered as jews <e> <s> of the who were registered as non-jews were accepted <e> <s> as the <e>", "<cs> a very silly question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stand in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to realise that there is very grave concern in the world not only here but throughout the world about this vicious and criminal set of gangsters who are at the head of this organisation and who are masterminding for other gangsters the kind of actions they themselves commit and that they have killed more of their own arab people than jews <e> <s> is he aware for example that the places where they concentrate in carrying on their activities are places like lebanon right in the heart of a christian population which hates them as much as anybody hates gangsters of that kind <e> <s> will he please realise that the kind of promise they make is something which cannot at the present time under any circumstances be accepted and that in conjunction with about other organisations including the ira they have been committing and are continuing to commit crimes against civilians and very rarely if ever against any military forces <e>", "<cs> rubbish <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister once more whether he is prepared to take a strong attitude here against terrorism <e> <s> will he point that out with regard to the plo not only to this country but to the countries of the eec who are taking attitudes like the lord privy seal took yesterday to make the plo these terrorists in a civilised world think that they are an accepted organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the ussr today is training terrorists from all over the world and <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for his reply may i ask him whether his attention has been drawn to the very serious allegations which have been laid in the case of frank terpil in the united states where it is alleged that vast amounts of arms have been supplied first to former president amin a murderer and secondly to the plo which is committed to murder in accordance with its national covenant of <e> <s> will he let us know whether he is prepared to examine legislation which exists in other states including america and find out whether or not more stringent legislation should be enacted in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for the reply he has given and ask him to consider how it was possible for arms which i think our own authorities have admitted to have been sent from this country for illegal purposes to have been supplied to a very considerable extent through agents in this country and by the people who are referred to in the investigation that is being carried on in america and similar dealers <e> <s> will he please see to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for his reply with which unfortunately so far as he is concerned i do not agree would he be good enough to investigate the matter properly <e> <s> is he aware that it is a sheer farce to suggest that protection is being given to people the rateable value of whose flats or apartments is or much less when in fact the machinations that are going on at present make it impossible to rent places the result being that the speculators are making vast profits by driving out the people who come within that range <e> <s> the fact is that there is no protection whatever at present <e> <s> will he please remember that similar matters arose as regards the necessity of enacting the leasehold reform act <e> <s> moreover similar matters have arisen with regard to the rent acts <e> <s> is it not time that the government realised that scarcity value is being created by those who are increasing the rents to such an extent that there are no places to rent in these areas <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect is the noble lord aware of the fact that the manipulations of those who are speculating in property are of such a nature that there are no places to rent <e> <s> is he aware that that is creating a scarcity value of an enormous proportion and that failure to observe the provisions which at present exist relating to securing values by tribunals when assessing the rentals payable creates a situation which dispossesses decent reasonable people and particularly those whose pensions are not inflation-linked <e> <s> in those circumstances i ask the noble lord to reconsider the whole matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating and offering my thanks to the government not only for the reply that has been given now but for their activities for quite a considerable time in this particular direction has the noble lords attention been drawn to the very serious matter which has arisen i think only yesterday of the arrest of four psychiatrists who have been protesting against the horrific methods by which psychiatric centres are being used in the ussr <e> <s> with thanks from ourselves and those who are interested and i am sure everybody in the house of lords is for what the government have done in these respects may i ask them to have another look and see what they can do in regard to such cases as for example those of sakharov to which the noble lord has referred and shcheransky and nudel <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me for putting one more question <e> <s> can he tell the house how other civilised signatories to the helsinki agreement have reacted to approaches which have been made by our government <e> <s> have our government been in contact with them telling them of the very important actions that they themselves are taking <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i was wondering whether to thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> is he satisfied that we are really dealing fairly with a friendly nation which is being attacked in the economic and other fields in a way which is disgraceful particularly in view of the fact that israel traded with us and took more by way of imports by far than her exports to us for years <e> <s> does he not think it might be an idea for him to have a word with the american authorities and the netherlands about this <e> <s> is he aware that the netherlands are now passing an act to deal with the position that they are not succumbing to this blackmoil and would he be good enough to see what they are doing with a view to trying to help in a similar direction <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask whether he is aware that i was referring to the fact that we have been trading with israel for very many years and that throughout that period she has been an excellent customer of ours <e> <s> is it not a disgrace that we should be succumbing to the blackmoil to which i referred by treating a friendly nation in that way <e> <s> will he please reconsider the netherlands position <e> <s> because they are introducing a competition bill to protect the country and anyone in the country from violating the moral duties of that country towards friendly nations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the question of the psychiatric treatment of people in the soviet republic was dealt with at all at that meeting <e> <s> furthermore what news has he if any about the four psychiatrists who have been arrested because they expressed themselves in no uncertain terms about the shocking way in which people are sent to psychiatric centres <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether the noble viscount is aware not only that the post offices which we have available are insufficient to cover the needs of aged people and people with children to bring with them to the post office but that in cases where the post offices are situated so far from each other less than a quarter of a mile but nevertheless so far from each other people have to come down steep slopes in order to collect their pensions and parents have to bring their children down those slopes because no other post office is available <e> <s> will he please inquire into that situation so that it may be remedied even though at the present time there is an economic crisis <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house what took place with regard to the very eminent scientists who are being compelled to take on menial jobs because they want to leave the ussr is there any step at all being taken on the ground of human rights and on the ground of the scientific advantage which these people can bring to the world so that this matter is considered when meetings of scientists are held <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord why on earth we allowed arms to be supplied to amin from this country <e> <s> for that is the situation according to the reports which have appeared in the american press which conducted an investigation into the supply of arms to that country <e> <s> why have we supplied the plo whose men are being trained in the ussr about whom everyone here is complaining so that they can be utilised against not only israel but our country and every other civilised country <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal obtained a copy of the regulations which apply in the united states of america in respect of the supply of arms and will he read them to see how different they arc from ours <e> <s> does he realise that in addition to all the questions that have been asked my question was not only about a rgime <e> <s> my question was as to why we are supplying arms to terrorists <e> <s> the plo are terrorists and they are being trained in russia <e> <s> we keep on talking about civil defence and other associated matters but at the same time we are allowing the arming of people who ultimately if a crisis does arise will be using those arms against us <e> <s> why have we supplied arms to terrorists <e>", "<cs> it is not very often that i disagree with amendments proposed on this side of the house <e> <s> i am bound to say that the argument which has just been put forward is extremely important particularly from the point of view of those religious denominations which have schools to which parents want to send their children <e> <s> i hope the committee will forgive me for referring to my own sphere the jewish people <e> <s> it is a religious section of the population <e> <s> many of them might be affected adversely if they could not send their children to schools of that denomination

be moved concerning this point by the noble duke the duke of norfolk which i propose to support <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness give way <e>", "<cs> from a personal point of view i should like to say that i am very grateful to the noble baroness for whom i have the highest regard as she knows even though we have crossed swords so very often in the course of our debates <e> <s> however she may

sects in this country <e> <s> i need not declare an interest i think everybody knows precisely whom i am talking about <e> <s> let me say at once that it would be a tragic thing for the denominational

act and the provisions which were being made by reasonable governments after long discussions dating from onwards were desirous of protecting those who occupied their homes and let us use the word
