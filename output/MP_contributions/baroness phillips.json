["<cs> my lords after listening to the splendid speeches by the two noble and learned lords starting with the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack followed by my noble and learned friend who sits on the front bench i feel that perhaps i need not intervene at all as they have said far better and with much greater conviction what i had intended to say <e> <s> indeed i was warned that as the lord lieutenant i must be neutral <e> <s> one of the whips of the government put it rather neatly i think <e> <s> he said you must be a nice neutral nora <e> <s> but i feel there is one thing that i cannot be neutral about and that is crime <e> <s> i had the pleasure of hearing the speech of the noble and learned lord at his first public occasion as lord chancellor when he opened some new courts and as always he not <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him why he referred to the labour party <e> <s> perhaps he does not realise that there has been a general election and that there has in fact been a change of government <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i wonder whether he would make it clear that i have no responsibility for the phillips curve <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble earl will forgive me for saying that it seems to me as a layman perhaps though i do have to work under the control of the companies act that this is not quite the right place to put this new clause <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to congratulate him on raising this very important point and perhaps draw his attention to another path along which he could pursue it <e> <s> undoubtedly some of the greatest sinners even more than industry i would suspect are the public corporations <e> <s> i know for a fact that schools hospitals and so on have a totally arbitrary period of the year in which boilers are stoked up irrespective of the weather or damped down even though you may well be freezing <e> <s> so it seems to me that an intelligent approach to the use of fuel in our public corporations would also be very worthy of the attentions of the noble earl <e> <s> this is not only to support him in this but indeed to thank him most cordially for bringing forward this very important point <e>", "<cs> my lords as lord lieutenant i should probably remain neutral but as an ex-teacher i cannot do so <e> <s> i must make a plea that we do not go backwards in time <e> <s> i taught in the days of the -plus when i can recall that children in a class of in london went to a grammar school and i taught in a school in surrey where children out of went to a grammar school <e> <s> why <e> <s> not because one group was more intelligent than the other but because there were more places available in one place than in the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in no way against the order because as my noble friend has just said it is absolutely essential but i find it very strange that there is a need to embody non-payment of fare <e> <s> i am not clear how you can actually get on a hovercraft without having paid your fare <e> <s> it is not like an underground train <e> <s> i wonder whether that is a little unnecessary in this instance <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i am not in favour of ticket frauds <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take advantage of the moving of this order by the noble lord the minister to ask him a slightly different question but one which is relevant to child benefit <e> <s> i have been increasingly approached by people who have not received their child benefit books owing to a go-slow an industrial dispute or something which is snarling up the machinery <e> <s> the irony of this is that the tax adjustment has already been made so that the husband has already lost the money which he would otherwise have had whereas the wife has not received child benefit <e> <s> in some cases this has been going on for months and i appeal to the minister to see that this needs to be looked at because it is causing serious problems <e> <s> it is not sufficient to say that they can go on supplementary benefit because they cannot <e> <s> this is a group which would not qualify in any case so that they are just losing the money <e> <s> therefore i hope that the minister with his great compassion will look at this matter and will see what it is that is holding up the works <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank my noble friend lord wells-pestell for introducing this debate today and to pay tribute to him for his splendid introduction <e> <s> also i should like to congratulate our three maiden speakers all from this side of the house and all people whom i have known and respected for a long time <e> <s> perhaps their splendid speeches will stop this nonsense in our party of wasting time by talking about abolishing the house of lords <e> <s> there are far more important issues for them to be paying attention to at this time instead of tearing themselves apart on this nonsense <e> <s> i think your lordships have heard me say this before <e> <s> i am going to suggest a referendum asking which house will you have abolished <e> <s> i think that people might get a shock from the answer <e> <s> but i should like to pay particular tribute to the three splendid maiden speakers and i hope that there will be many occasions when we shall hear them again <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene in this debate for one moment and to thank the noble earl for asking this question today <e> <s> since he has couched it in very wide terms i hope her majestys government will deal with it in wide terms <e> <s> it is always interesting when dealing with people who come before the court not merely for drug offences but for other reasons to observe the number of people who plead <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord why his right honourable friend selected only two womens organisations <e> <s> there are a very large number of womens organisations which have a very useful contribution to make <e> <s> it is rather hard on the rest of them when they constantly see the government always going to the same two groups <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he would put to his right honourable friend the view i do not think that it carries the force of law that since it has been suggested to private industry that it is highly desirable to have both worker participation and indeed consumer participation at the highest board level it would be extremely unfortunate at this time if the nationalised industries were to be seen not to be carrying out this very useful process of improving the quality of the service which they can give <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble baroness <e> <s> lady macleod of borve and refer to the question of the small retailer <e> <s> i consider that we have the best shops in the world whether we are speaking about large or small ones <e> <s> it is not by accident that people travel both from the west and from the continent in great numbers to come to our shops <e> <s> we should be very proud of them <e> <s> as the noble baroness said napoleon wishing to insult us called us a nation of shopkeepers <e> <s> in my travels i find that invariably the small shopkeeper is the backbone of the community where he has his small shop <e> <s> i meet them all the time in social clubs from youth groups to cultural groups <e> <s> one realises the great contribution mainly unsung that they make to the community <e>", "<cs> i would hope that the minister will not agree with that slightly immoral suggestion from the noble lord opposite that the minister says that he will consult when he has no intention of doing so and already has his mind made up <e> <s> whatever we think about ministers it would be unfortunate if it went on the record that they actually do what the noble lord described <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief because so many of my noble friends have expressed their views so well and there are many more to come <e> <s> in common with many of your lordships i think i have rarely received so many letters about a particular bill <e> <s> these have come not from great revolutionaries but from non-political people people who are concerned about the handicapped and from people from my own catholic education council group and so on <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the noble baronesss explanation but i am not sure that any authority has actually attempted to abolish nursery schools hitherto <e>", "<cs> well in very recent times but not as a matter of practice <e> <s> however i accept the explanation of the noble baroness and hope that this will mean we shall have more nursery schools though of that i am a little doubtful <e> <s> i am a chairman of governors of a voluntary-aided school and i feel very strongly with the right reverend prelate who has just spoken that the clause on transport is probably going to hit the voluntary-aided schools more than any others <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord what are these limited facilities bearing in mind that there are those of us in this house who have sought unsuccessfully for some time actually to spend our own money in the dining room of the house of commons <e> <s> there are certain noble lords who feel <e>", "<cs> my lords many of your lordships will have sympathy with the noble and learned lords amendment but as one who has the misfortune and i say that very firmly to travel frequently on british rail on saturdays not in scotland where it seems to be even <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that at this early stage in our discussions i have to cross swords with my noble friend lord stewart of fulham <e> <s> i have had the unique experience of having for a very long time been chairman of governors in a catholic school <e> <s> i have had to fight off on the one hand the westminster schools commission and on the other hand the ilea <e> <s> if anybody wishes to witness a buck-passing exercise they have to look no farther than that example <e> <s> if one group says that it is not its responsibility then the other group equally says it is not its responsibility either <e>", "<cs> i wish that the noble lords who keep intervening in this debate would not constantly refer to broad-based governors <e> <s> i have been a governor for some time and i am getting broader h the base all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend in her restatement of what the county councils and also the other educationists have said <e> <s> throughout the whole of this debate it has concerned me that on both sides of the house we have constantly reiterated the phrase bright children <e> <s> i was one of many members of your lordships house who went to grant-aided schools when they went through the terrible trauma of having to make a decision either to come into the state scheme or become independent <e> <s> as i recall about per cent <e> <s> went independent and per cent <e> <s> went into the state scheme <e> <s> it seems to me that if we constantly suggest that only the independent school can provide education for the bright child we are downgrading those schools which did not remain independent <e> <s> they cannot have changed very much because it is only about a year or two years since this whole business was gone through <e> <s> this clause makes no particular reference to bright or gifted children <e> <s> it uses the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble baroness and say that she has introduced a new real and practical note which we always rely upon her to do in these debates <e> <s> i am not very hopeful that the government will take any notice of any of us on this <e> <s> we all know that governments only respond to the people using their feet and voting against them <e> <s> as one of the noble lords has said earlier so many of their lordships are partaking of their own milk supply at this moment that they are not able to be present to hear our arguments <e>", "<cs> i believe that these are the clause and the subsection which according to the notes issued for guidance provide <e>", "<cs> without wishing to press the minister i should like a reply perhaps in writing as to how this formula of earnings will be worked out <e> <s> i am left completely confused <e> <s> if a pensioner has an increased pension in the past the amount that can be earned has also increased <e> <s> is this still to be tied to earnings or is it to be tied to prices <e> <s> if it is to he tied to prices then i do not understand how the formula is to be worked out <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> ft seems strange that one has to have flexibility when paying out pensions to people <e> <s> there is no flexibility in the tax laws we have to submit our tax by a certain date or else <e> <s> so far as i can recall there is certainly no flexibility in the payment of wages or earnings <e> <s> ones contract of employment always relates to certain days in the month <e> <s> here we are dealing with people who have very small sums of money to handle so that if one is receiving something like only a week the odd pound which would not be noticed by a higher wage-earner becomes very important <e> <s> i cannot see why the government needs flexibility when paying out whereas they certainly give no flexibility when receiving money from the citizen <e>", "<cs> i do not think that one wants to press the noble baroness because obviously as regards some of the sins that we are accusing this government of i must say that other governments have been equally guilty <e> <s> i recall that we created a situation where the pension was announced in may i believe and increased in november and when certain people asked why it had to be for such a long period the answer was that all pension books had to be amended and it was a very complicated administrative job <e> <s> at that time i pointed out that when british rail raise their fares they do not have any of these qualms they simply overstamp the price of the fare and they do it the next day <e> <s> i repeat that it is only when money is paid out that we get administrative problems <e> <s> it is not when money is paid in that will always be smoothed over things will be done quickly <e> <s> i feel that once again we are having the administrative argument used as well as the economic one <e> <s> this concerns a group of people who as has just been said feel a sense of grievance because they are already on low static incomes <e> <s> the noble baroness the minister referred earlier to productivity hut if the poor dears actually go and earn some money the first thing that happens is that their pension is taken away and they are taxed so they cannot really <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend <e> <s> this is a subject to which i have returned so many times <e> <s> i only hope i live long enough to see the rule abolished <e> <s> i was interested to hear my noble friend say that all parties wanted abolition of the earnings rule <e> <s> were i not in your lordships house i would have said colloquially you could have fooled me <e> <s> no government that i can recall for the last years has made any attempt to abolish it they have simply brought in arguments concerning how costly it would be to abolish it <e> <s> i merely repeat what i have said so many times before <e> <s> this is the <e>", "<cs> i think that there is a very interesting technical point which has not been mentioned and i am not sure that i should draw the governments attention to it if they have not already thought about it <e> <s> if one is a widow at one has the option of changing from the widows pension to the retirement pension which is the same amount <e> <s> but of course the widows pension is not subject to the earnings rule <e> <s> so any widows who have remained in work and i have had quite <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot let the noble baroness lady hornsby-smith get away with that <e> <s> we are not talking about people on consultancy fees of a year we are talking about the kind of people who man the catering industries <e> <s> there are certain industries in this country where no one else wants the jobs <e> <s> do not let us fool ourselves <e> <s> those industries would actually fall apart if it were not for people of retirement age <e> <s> i could tell the noble baroness of a number of people who certainly do not have two pensions they have their retirement pension and they have to work very hard for the other small amount of money they receive <e> <s> it would be interesting for the noble baroness to see some of the people actually working in the palace of westminster they are not working at gay happy and easy jobs <e> <s> therefore it is unreal to suggest that these people would actually take occupations from others <e> <s> in the main the older worker does the kind of job that no one of a younger age wants to do <e>", "<cs> on the question of the older person not receiving a death grant this is something about which i spoke to my labour government when we were in office i recall my mother who died last year at the age of often saying with great irony i am sorry i have lived so long that you cannot collect the death grant and i think she had gone down to the nothing point although in her case it did not matter <e> <s> however recently i was made aware of an elderly couple both well into the late s where one died and because they had been on pension for so long that was the moment when they really did not have very much <e> <s> the couple had a small insurance and one appreciates the terrible hardship imposed on the poor woman who was trying to do the right thing <e> <s> she had no children and nobody to help her <e> <s> obviously this problem will solve itself because people of this great age will get fewer and fewer <e> <s> surely this is a moment when the government could do something about the situation <e> <s> the figure would probably not even amount to million when it is actually granted <e> <s> obviously there will be fewer and fewer old people in this group <e> <s> it seems a curious anomaly to think that the longer one lives the less one appears to need money <e> <s> in fact i believe that the longer one lives the more one needs money <e> <s> i do not follow the logic behind these provisions indeed perhaps there is no logic behind them <e> <s> they cause great hardship to a remarkable group of people in our own generation <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to have to disagree with the noble baroness i rarely do but surely the original concept of paying into a pool was not that one would automatically draw from it what one had paid in <e> <s> in that event one would almost have had to ensure that one was handicapped sick or widowed in order to get back the money one had paid in <e> <s> i paid into the scheme in the hope that i would not have the need to draw upon it but if somebody else had to draw upon it because he or she was handicapped elderly widowed or unemployed one paid ones contribution to assist such people <e> <s> i know that in theory there was a breakdown but all workers assumed that they made their contributions not necessarily for them personally to draw upon <e> <s> i believe that would be a dreadful argument in relation to social security <e> <s> we are talking about those who are in need not necessarily about those who pay for these things <e>", "<cs> i wonder why the minister says that to call it clothing requirements would be confusing <e> <s> i should have thought that the others normal additional and so on would be even more confusing <e> <s> surely what is normal to one person is not necessarily normal to another <e> <s> we are talking rather gaily about this lump sum as if it is a vast amount of money <e> <s> anyone who has attempted to get shoes repaired always assuming that one can find a repairer will know that it does not take very long <e> <s> the scales which relate to the buying of clothes are quite out-of-date <e> <s> i was mystified by the suggestion that because you call it what it really is it confuses people <e> <s> i should have thought that it simplified it <e>", "<cs> i think this is one area where governments again cannot really ever make up their minds <e> <s> we come back again to this question of flexibility <e> <s> i do not know what the situation is now but i remember that certain widows who were accused of living with men had their pensions taken away and they were found guilty while being proved innocent which was unusual except in that circumstance <e> <s> there we had a position of flexibility which built up to some very sad cases which i remember i actually handled <e> <s> on the other side i recall unless the act has been changed because i think i was then at the box dealing with this particular one the one for people over when the state very generously gave them p a week extra if they survived that long <e> <s> if i remember rightly they could also collect this even if they were living in sin <e> <s> when you are older as my mother once said the sweets of life go to those who have no teeth <e> <s> the government cannot really clear their mind i do not mean this government in particular but most governments <e> <s> i think there is a danger in leaving it too flexible bearing in mind the real hardship caused to widows <e> <s> that i saw for myself <e>", "<cs> i think there is another point which has not been mentioned on this occasion namely that if you do not comply with the rules in connection with an application for supplementary benefit you are subject to law <e> <s> the recently reported case which i have mentioned before and which seems to me totally disgraceful of the poor old man who was sent to prison for six months because he did not reveal to the supplementary benefits commission that he had savings in building societies seems to indicate the absolute necessity for those who apply to understand precisely that they do this within a legal concept because it is even more important than not getting their rights if having obtained supplementary benefit they are then going to be accused of not complying with the rules <e>", "<cs> the noble lord who has replied has been so kind and charming that i hate having to put these questions to him <e> <s> is it really seriously suggested that you should determine by interview whether one person would put more into three days than some people put into five as was suggested in the brief <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment involving my noble friend and my work with help the aged <e> <s> i hope that the government are not going to tell us that this amendment would cost a lot of money <e> <s> for one thing they cannot possibly estimate what it will cost nor can they have any idea how many people will take it up <e> <s> but we do know that it cannot be a large number <e> <s> this is a group in the community to whom we pay tribute <e> <s> they have taken the trouble to try to maintain themselves in their old age <e> <s> if these elderly people are transplanted into old peoples homes or special flats they will cost the taxpaper a great deal of money <e> <s> this must be not only the best way of allowing them to remain for the rest of their lives in dignity in the end it must also be the cheapest <e> <s> i was very taken with the expression used by my noble friend that some people die rich but live poor <e> <s> it is often said i believe that some people are the richest men in the churchyard <e> <s> let us make it possible for them to enjoy life in their own homes <e> <s> this is a group in the community which cannot of necessity be very large in number <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister will be glad to know that i appreciate her reply bearing in mind that there is a great deal of concern about what appeared to be action on behalf of a report a political report which seemed to be curiously inaccurate <e> <s> the parents teachers and children concerned will be very glad to know that there is to be another inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the minister will be making another statement on the committee to be set up may i ask her for an assurance that the committee will not be composed merely of conservatives but will take into account all parties and all interests <e>", "<cs> finally my lords is the minister aware that this report which is very far-reaching so far as ilea is concerned was received at county hall only through indirect means which to put it at its lowest seems highly discourteous and at its highest really quite dangerous because they obviously had no way of making comment on this <e> <s> in some cases they read about it through the press and in other cases they obtained copies of the report quite indirectly <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but surely the minister is incorrect <e> <s> the report may not have been commissioned by the government but it was certainly set up by the minister of state for education <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether that amounts to it having been commissioned by the government but the terms of reference specifically stated that it was set up by the minister of state <e>", "<cs> my lords having had the opportunity to work with the <e>", "<cs> my lords mine is a question as well bearing in mind the standing orders <e> <s> i should like to ask what the government have in mind when they say less serious type of non-violent offence <e> <s> perhaps like others of your lordships i am just suffering from the effects of yet another break-in <e> <s> i feel it would be undesirable if the government were too hasty to empty the prisons on that very narrow definition <e> <s> at the risk of sounding like the hanging judge since all parts of the house have referred to the increase in the number of prisoners i would remind your lordships that there has also been an increase in the number of crimes <e> <s> there is still a way to keep out of prison and that is by not committing crime <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned the mentally ill and alcoholics <e> <s> i would be very interested to know what other class of prisoner would be considered as liable to a shorter sentence merely to empty the prisons which does seem to me a very curious reason for dealing with this problem in this way <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend adopts that course may i ask the <e>", "<cs> i did not like the other fixed sum either my lords <e>", "<cs> i am not concerned with forestry but i am a lover of trees and <e>", "<cs> by coincidence i was discussing this today with a taxi driver <e> <s> i am sorry to tell the noble lord that he informed me that in the metropolitan district of london it is illegal for a taxi driver to invite other people into the taxi <e> <s> a customer may invite another to share but the driver may not <e> <s> i do not think it would in any way cut across the schedule that we have already <e>", "<cs> my lords a slight anti-climax i beg to introduce a bill to make provision for the basis on which water authorities shall make charges in relation to the discharge of effluent from launderettes and for purposes connected therewith <e> <s> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i make no apology for bringing it to the house <e> <s> i have been asked by the justices clerks society and the magistrates association to introduce the bill <e> <s> mr neville trotter mp piloted the bill through the house of commons <e> <s> this is not a controversial matter though nowadays one becomes doubtful when that is said and all trade bodies have been consulted and have raised no objections except in regard to one point which will necessitate an amendment to which i shall make reference <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his very clear explanation <e> <s> i did not refer to the second point raised since we are not going to have the amendment on it <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for explaining that <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend lord boston for his kind words <e> <s> one is always diffident with a technical bill of this kind <e> <s> incidentally i was interested to see that the persons who can be disqualified from having a full licence are sheriffs officers a legal process server a person who has been convicted of forging a justices licence a person who knowingly used a forged justices licence a person who has been convicted of certain brothel offences and a ships pilot which seems to show that almost anybody else can hold a licence unlike having a vote <e> <s> i should like to thank your lordships for having received this bill in the way you have <e> <s> i am not quite certain of the protocol but i am grateful to the noble lords department for helping me in framing the amendment and i look forward to the committee stage at an early date <e>", "<cs> my lords while we are clarifying points this may have been mentioned earlier but so many of these clauses refer to repute and in one case good repute <e> <s> we are creating criminal offences as my noble friend pointed out <e> <s> is this repute in his professional capacity or in his moral or social capacity <e> <s> there is a difference <e> <s> it seems to me that we are creating some problems for the courts because of the rather vague definitions which occur in several of these clauses <e> <s> i am also fascinated by the amount of the fines which seem to vary very much from one clause to another <e> <s> obviously some of these offences are much more serious than others though it is very difficult to discern it when studying the bill <e> <s> i should like to know on the point about knowingly what kind of repute we are talking about <e> <s> is it professional repute <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like to be in any way ungracious enough to spoil those thanks <e> <s> i merely want to say that surely the increased money being paid out is because the cost of the gas and the electricity has gone up <e> <s> so in fact no extra money has been paid out <e>", "<cs> at a slightly different level and this may answer the noble lord lord nugent of guildford if noble lords opposite do not wish to be accused of being hard-hearted it is salutary to recall that the bill is described as for the purpose of reducing benefits <e>", "<cs> i should like to return to the point of economics <e> <s> it is unnecessary to labour the point which so many noble lords have rightly made about the poverty and the sheer hardship which will be imposed by various parts of the bill <e> <s> however a few years ago i did a piece of research into the tax position of people in a lower income <e>", "<cs> do we understand that if it is found to be uneconomic the government will not bring it in <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister replies may i draw attention to the fact that the government are yet again perpetuating the rather curious idea that some benefits will be either better or worse according to the year in which a particular act comes into force <e> <s> to take for example the widows allowance it appears from what the minister has said that a woman who becomes a widow in one year will be better off than a woman who becomes a widow in another year <e> <s> that is something you do not determine nor indeed desire <e>", "<cs> i shall not pursue my point about the general principle until we come to the clause stand part debate <e> <s> but the noble lord lord drumalbyn will not be surprised because i have pursued several governments on this point including labour governments <e>", "<cs> will the minister forgive me for intervening before he leaves this point <e> <s> he said something that i have not heard before that is that the survey showed that these people were receiving unemployment benefit but were not available for work <e> <s> how could you <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will let me know because i do not see how he can reach that figure <e>", "<cs> no it does not satisfy me <e>", "<cs> as the one who originally raised this point i should like to pursue it because the reply given by the noble lord lord sandys appeared to refer to a report <e> <s> was that report prepared by the department <e> <s> from what he said it seemed to be an outside report <e> <s> we all know about market research you can get any answer you like if you ask the right question <e> <s> the report in question seems to have originated in this way that people leaving the manpower services centres were stopped and asked did you want work or were you just coming here for a walk <e> <s> and they gave an answer <e>", "<cs> we cannot let it go on the record that we started this business because it was the minister the noble lord lord sandys who said that his noble friend the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter had made the remark that we we have been discussing <e> <s> that is why we followed up the point we on this side of the committee did not raise it <e> <s> we have simply tried to answer the accusation and to point out that these people are not layabouts <e> <s> may i say to the noble viscount that if he went to a labour exchange or a manpower centre he would not think it unreasonable to expect the type of job to which he was accustomed rather than one to which he was not accustomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that this bill do now pass i feel <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the lord chancellors pardon <e> <s> i was trying to speed up legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that this bill do now pass may i say how sorry i am that the noble lord selected my poor little bill for a long speech <e> <s> if he really wanted to get on perhaps we could have avoided that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like this occasion to pass without adding my own plea to the minister both as a londoner who is proud of my city and as one who has the great privilege of being lord lieutenant of greater london <e> <s> many years ago when i first entered this house i spoke in a very disparaging way about another hideous monstrosity which still stands partly unoccupied after about years namely centre point <e> <s> i described it then as the most expensive dog kennel in europe at that time it had about dogs occupying it and nobody else and that got into some of the european magazines <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow up this point although i know we shall be on finance later <e> <s> throughout the whole of this bill there does not seem to have been a reference that i have heard to the fact that as in private business these houses have been paid for wholly before they are sold <e> <s> the money has to be borrowed at the expense of the ratepayers <e> <s> if that money has already been repaid all well and good <e> <s> but surely some of these houses will still have to continue to be paid for by the ratepayers so they will be subsidising a sale of a house <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies may i say that i think it would be most unfortunate if the party opposite went on record as the defenders of the people who wish to buy houses and we on this side of the committee were described as the grinders of the faces of the poor <e> <s> nothing could be further from the truth <e> <s> it is always useful to have a long memory and i think i can recall that it was one of the philosophies of the conservative party apropos local authority housing that in my own area there was a description of a poor old lady who lived in a private house and who had to pay rates which made some contribution to the people who were living in rented local authority housing <e> <s> i cannot see the difference except that in this case it is possible that they could make a profit from the poor old lady living in a privately owned house <e> <s> that is the kind of thing that we have in mind <e>", "<cs> i should like to make just one point <e> <s> i did not think there were sub-tenancies in local authority housing <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a little unfortunate that we again have this curious wording compulsory up-rating <e> <s> we then refer to a decrease in up-rating <e> <s> it is to me rather like the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if the noble baroness will forgive me for intervening <e> <s> as i read this it includes maternity allowance <e> <s> surely that is taxed <e> <s> it is taxed as part of the family income <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is always so charming that it is difficult to have to follow him and to contradict him <e> <s> he said that this was not a popular measure <e> <s> he can repeat that <e> <s> it goes further it is an unjust measure <e> <s> i am doubtful about the amount of money and i have said this many times that would be saved because no government can know how many retirement pensioners are going to work and therefore can be caught by this and since <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to pick up one point <e> <s> i feel that some one should reply to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter who appeared to reprimand the noble lord lord banks for daring to suggest that the national insurance fund should not be interfered with <e> <s> i think he said that it was not sacrosanct <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i take the noble lords point <e> <s> i do not think i am misrepresenting him <e> <s> i think he will find that he said that the national insurance fund was not sancrosant <e> <s> but i think he also said that the noble lord lord banks made an insidious suggestion <e> <s> i am sure he used that phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i would only ask if the national insurance fund is not and indeed has not been regarded for many years as something a little different from money taken from the national exchequer why does every bill contain a special reference to the fact that there is an increase or that there is money taken from it <e> <s> if it is not a special fund and is not something different then there is no necessity at all to mention it in any bills <e> <s> it will simply be part of the general exchequer <e> <s> it will simply be part of what is taken from taxes <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will heed the plea that where possible the area health authorties will be coterminous with existing authorities <e> <s> one of the things that people suffer nowadays is that they have hardly got used to the name of the authority before it is changed <e> <s> certainly it is possible to be in one area for health another area for education another area to pay your electricity bill another one for the post office and so on <e> <s> we add all the time to the complication of life to a number of very simple people who in the end really do not know where they go for the particular services they demand <e> <s> this has never been more noticeable than in the health services <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord moves to that matter does he know whether these activities would be subject to all the other restrictions which other people have to undergo for example having to pay vat on tickets for an entertainment <e> <s> there is also the question of produce <e> <s> if they are going to sell jams in order to raise money for the hospital that may be condemned by the public health authorities <e> <s> but i suppose that that may be one way of stimulating customers in the hospital <e> <s> the matter is not simple at all <e> <s> any of us who indulge in money-raising know that you suddenly run into many different regula <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister ends this discussion may i make an appeal to him since this matter seems to be very much in the embryo stage to remind his right honourable friend that in particular the hotels provide not merely a profit but also a service <e> <s> as one who has the misfortune to spend a fair amount of time in the hotels provided <e>", "<cs> as an englishwoman i hesitate to intervene in this scottish debate but a point which the minister made mystified me <e> <s> he said that owner-occupied houses presupposed greater mobility <e> <s> i am chairman of governors of a school and i can tell him that anybody seeking to move from scotland even if they are selling their house cannot possibly purchase a house in the south-east at anything vaguely like the same price <e> <s> so often do we find that the young professionals are totally immobilised because the values are so very different according to the area in which they are living <e> <s> i feel it would be unfortunate if it remained on the record that everybody who owned a house had greater mobility because that is not so <e>", "<cs> if the minister thinks that we are ferocious he has not seen us in action <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like the bill to pass without making a comment <e> <s> it has been described as mean and as bad <e> <s> i would prefer to call it a sad bill <e> <s> i have been active in the field of social security and pensions for a very large part of my life in voluntary organisations when i had the privilege of serving in government and when sitting on the front bench of the opposition <e> <s> with my noble friends i think that this must be the first time that a bill described as a social security bill contained only clauses to abolish or reduce social security <e> <s> the whole concept of social security if we go back to the original beveridge plan was that it would bolster up during the bad times those who were unfortunate enough to need to draw from it <e> <s> we all pay into the pool in the hope that we shall not need to draw from this particular pool but that if we do so it would be there to support us <e>", "<cs> my lords can we just establish at the very beginning of this debate that the elderly by act of parliament are persons over the age of <e> <s> that has never been declared before but it was in an act of parliament relating to pensions <e> <s> if we continue to talk about the elderly it is very confusing <e> <s> the amendment distinctly says persons of pensionable age which is a different proposition and i think it would be most useful if throughout the debate the minister would refer to the group we are actually talking about <e>", "<cs> i should like to know how far on in time this goes my lords <e> <s> i have an example of a widow who was the tenant and remarried and then died then the husband became the tenant and remarried and his wife became the tenant and this has gone on for some time <e> <s> they have been protected right through <e> <s> does the same rule apply <e> <s> in other words for how long in time does this situation continue <e>", "<cs> to the third or only the second my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support this amendment <e> <s> i feel that the arguments have been so well deployed both by the mover and the subsequent speakers that i will not waste valuable time replying <e> <s> i would merely say that this proposal must be in line with the governments thinking because this is an attempt to assist people as the noble baroness who has just spoken so rightly said to remain in their own homes and not to be a charge on the state <e> <s> this is a group who would particularly resent that but who would be quite happy if they could indeed draw an annuity and remain in their own homes for as long as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that there are still far too many schools playing fields and other places closed while there are with working mothers and with one-parent families millions of children who will be for the next six weeks totally left to their own resources <e> <s> would the minister not agree that it is better to spend money using leisure facilities than having the children get into trouble when we will subsequently have to spend more money on trying to pick up the pieces <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to seem ungracious but i think my noble friend has made my point <e> <s> i was asking for a little more than just a factual reply <e> <s> i was asking for direct encouragement from the government because we all know that local authorities pick up very quickly anything which they feel they are getting directly from above <e> <s> before we come to the next long holiday can we expect something a little more imaginative from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like the noble lord to recognise that we are in fact trying to support him in our plea <e> <s> in other words although our words are addressed in this house we hope that by some magic influence they will reach the ears of his colleagues in another place because it is important that in the next parliament this house should have the opportunity of starting some major bills <e> <s> will the noble lord the leader of the house appreciate that when we make our plea it is to strengthen his arm and that we perhaps can also make our presence felt with our own group in the other house if the inspiration comes from the government <e> <s> unless the government make their voice heard very loudly we still shall not get the opportunity to have these major bills in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to intervene on two very short points and if i do not receive an answer immediately i shall quite understand <e> <s> the first concerns the younger widow <e> <s> i have searched all the regulations very carefully and i cannot find any reference to the increase other than the statement on i think page which refers to the widows pension and to the increase to which the noble minister referred <e> <s> it then says something about per cent <e> <s> of the sum being the lower permanent rate <e> <s> i worked out per cent <e> <s> of and it seems to me that it is only about <e> <s> the minister will remember that the younger widow is the one who comes in under <e> <s> she receives a lower rate <e>", "<cs> my lords it is between and that i am interested in <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord avebury replies and i should not like to strike a note that does not fit in with the general harmony i should merely like to say having seen the appalling mess and destruction that confronts one on certain motorways or side roads that i hope that the noble lord is always talking about the genuine romany <e> <s> there are people who are not genuine gipsies and i thought that he spoke in a slightly derogatory way about the residents <e>", "<cs> i do not want to debate the point with the noble lord but the rubbish is not only on the sites it spreads along the edges of the motorways <e> <s> it is not domestic rubbish but pieces of cars which they have dismantled <e> <s> these people are not living in poverty <e> <s> we are talking about people who are living in caravans of great luxury <e> <s> i do not deny them that right but i think that the people who live in those areas also have rights <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not a point of principle i leave that to my noble friends who are much more knowledgeable <e> <s> however this seems to be an unusual bill in several ways <e> <s> it is peppered with initials <e> <s> i see that there is a reference to direct labour organisations in one of the subsections <e> <s> i am not clear why we should use initials in an act of parliament <e> <s> the next thing will <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble minister will be pleased to hear that i do not want to put a point to him but only to offer a little fortuitous advice which he may not want <e> <s> there is already a common idea abroad that people taking driving tests are turned down the first time because the authority will collect more money if several tests are taken <e> <s> i am sure that is quite wrong but it is a common idea <e> <s> it just occurs to me that if the planning application has to carry a fee the idea will rapidly arise abroad that if it is turned down several times the fee will have to be paid each time <e> <s> of course i am sure that is not in the mind of any local authority or of the government but you cannot stop people thinking such things <e> <s> also the minister said that one had an option <e> <s> but surely you have no option if you want to do a certain piece of work you have to apply to the planning authority <e> <s> i do not quite see where the option comes in <e> <s> the option is to break the law put up the garage or whatever it is and then watch while it is pulled down <e> <s> you will not change what human nature will make of this once it is on the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble lord who has just spoken particularly in his last words <e> <s> there is a great need for what one can only describe in industrial parlance as a good public relations exercise to be made on behalf of this chamber indeed to be made on behalf of having a second chamber at all <e> <s> i was interested to hear one peers comment the other day that if new peers were created perhaps they would then vote for the abolition of the other place which is a possibility that mr tony benn has probably not thought about <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will forgive me for interrupting <e> <s> i think i made the remark and if i may say so it is a little dangerous if the noble lord does not listen carefully <e> <s> what i said was that a public relations exercise is needed <e> <s> i did not say that it had to be done by the bbc or by any other medium <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not intervene at any length because i know that so many of the speakers have covered a marvellous amount of ground and indeed those to follow me will also do so <e> <s> however i should like to congratulate the noble baroness not only on the quality of her speech which we have come to expect but on her cleverness at getting this debate at the beginning of the launching of more caring for the disabled <e>", "<cs> i notice that the minister refers constantly to the similarity between employed and self-employed <e> <s> certainly it would not be fair if the self-employed entered the scheme at the same point as the employed <e> <s> but i think we must remember that the self-employed not only do not receive the benefits to which the minister referred they do not receive unemployment benefit and they do not receive sickness benefit <e> <s> so we have to be very careful when we talk about the correlation of payments because the benefits drawn are totally different <e>", "<cs> no i said that <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend considers withdrawing the amendment there is a point i must raise <e> <s> having listened to the noble lord lord cockfield who with all the magic of paul daniels could have sawn the lady in half having first convinced her that he was doing it for her own good may i draw to his attention a reference he made which i suggest should be put right for the record <e> <s> he suggested that people opting out made no contributions or if he did not say that he used a similar phrase <e> <s> he will he aware that they opt out of only one part of the contribution and that is in respect of the retirement pension in other words those who pay for a private scheme and perhaps when the noble lord reviews what he said i am glad i taught maths because i could almost understand what he said he will bear in mind that everybody contributes although they do not necessarily contribute to one particular section <e>", "<cs> yes but they are contracted out of only one part <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws his amendment will the minister say whether the close season is in the interests of the birds or in the interests of people who wish to shoot them at another time <e>", "<cs> as the government have accepted the amendment particularly on the injunction of my front bench i should not like to prolong the discussion <e> <s> i found some of the arguments slightly strange in that if the grey squirrel is so unkind to its cousin any act of parliament which protects the red squirrel will not be read by the grey squirrel <e> <s> it seems a curious argument to advance in favour of protecting the squirrel <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to pay tribute to the noble baroness who i understand through leaks was in fact one of the people who fought for the retention of the ilea as a single authority <e> <s> if that is the case then i should like to thank the noble baroness <e> <s> i should also like to know whether this is the final debate that we shall have on this matter or whether we are to see the famous report of the inspectorate <e> <s> as chairman for a period of years of the governors of a school where we certainly do not even have inside lavatories yet and we are very typical of many london schools i am extremely puzzled to know how the inspectorate found that we exceeded our needs and indeed that we displayed unchecked extravagance <e> <s> those arc very emotive words and if the inspectorate actually found that to be the case i think that those of us who work within the ilea are entitled to know in what particulars they found both those statements to be true <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin to feel that it is a pity we ever invented the word nationalised industries <e> <s> i recall quite recently doing some canvassing and a very strange old lady told me she did not want to support the labour party because they were going to nationalise all women <e> <s> i suggested to her that possibly it would have increased her chances but she did not seem to accept the nature of my comment <e> <s> when i was a young socialist we did not speak of nationalised industries and neither did the noble lord who introduced this debate <e> <s> he referred to public owned <e> <s> i always saw community-owned facilities <e>", "<cs> i would not like to pre-empt what the minister will say but i think it is unusual not to have in an act of parliament the linking of the fine with the imprisonment the and/or phrase <e> <s> i think it would be breaking new ground <e> <s> i am not arguing whether it is right or wrong but simply saying that it would be unusual to have a statutory offence which had only the fine as the penalty <e>", "<cs> i do not want to take issue with the noble lord but i do not know of an indictable offence that does not carry imprisonment and/or a fine <e>", "<cs> my lords if nobody is going to be able to comment for a whole year surely it is a totally ridiculous situation which the minister cannot substantiate in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be able to ask this group to follow up this very simple and perhaps mundane question whatever happened to the cod <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down he said there should be more control over these activities <e> <s> as one who has suffered constantly from the total inefficiency of the private builder and has had no control over trying to get him <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not keep the house for very long but i should like to underline what my noble friend has just said <e> <s> recently i was in an hotel restaurant an experience which many noble lords will have had where four of us were attempting to order <e> <s> it was an expensive restaurant <e> <s> since none of the waiters spoke english the outcome was that the only kind of order which was effective was the kind attaching to the numbers on the menu <e> <s> if you wanted no <e> <s> that was splendid <e> <s> but if you wanted roast potatoes as opposed to saut potatoes that was not understood <e> <s> it was an irritating and frustrating experience <e> <s> anybody who as i do spends time on the no <e> <s> bus knows how entertaining it can be <e> <s> even this morning a bus conductor was trying to explain to somebody that that particular bus was the right numbered bus but it was not going as far as the individual wanted to go <e> <s> this held up all the workers and resulted in some irritation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i ask her whether there is any definition of this linguistic competence <e> <s> luckily i am healthy and have not been in hospital but we have all suffered at hotel registration counters because of somebody who speaks only about words of english <e> <s> they can understand you provided you keep within the tramlines of i am so-and-so and i wish to register here <e> <s> but if you ask them anything beyond that they give you a completely blank look because their english is very limited <e> <s> in a hotel or restaurant this can be frustrating but in a casualty department it would be absolutely dangerous <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister replies and this may be irrelevent i wonder whether he would answer this point <e> <s> this may be irrelevant but we seem to be concerned about the shooting of certain birds in particular seasons <e> <s> i am rather intrigued to know that irrespective of seasons in this particular clause apparently one can kill any of the birds on christmas day or sundays in scotland <e> <s> it seems as if it cuts right across whether it is the month which is applicable if there is this rather curious clause <e> <s> i am sure that there is an explanation but i cannot think what it is offhand <e>", "<cs> my lords does it mean that you can shoot on sundays even though it is in the closed season <e> <s> i do not really understand what it means <e>", "<cs> i do not often take issue with my noble friend in fact i very rarely do but as the unfortunate company secretary of a very small trading concern which is limited i am bound to say that i find that each government not necessarily this one have heaped on small companies so much work that we now have the ridiculous situation that out of a staff of six one is there simply to deal with all the various matters that are required by law <e> <s> where you have directors who are not receiving any remuneration you still have to make all the returns of their directorships of other companies <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me before he leave that very important point may i say that as an ex-teacher and a governor of a school certainly the teacher-pupil ratio is better <e> <s> but when i taught it was about pupils to a class it is now only down to about whereas our public schools are in a very different position <e> <s> therefore it is quite wrong to suggest that the pupil-teacher ratio is now admirable <e> <s> it still has a long way to go <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow up what my noble friend has said in that as the noble lord lord lyell will be aware a charity carries certain privileges including a zero rating for vat <e> <s> will this also have to be extended to professions <e> <s> it seems to me to be a slightly dangerous precedent to establish <e>", "<cs> my lords may a magistrate intervene <e> <s> this proposal seems to me to require a <e>", "<cs> my lords i sometimes wonder when i listen to discussions on a bill of this kind whether some of your lordships live in the same world as i do <e> <s> i certainly do not feel that they live in the same city as i do or sit in courts of the same type as those in which i sit <e> <s> i should first of all like to congratulate the government on introducing a bill which is among very few of its kind a kind among which i always saw the much disliked certainly on the part of the noble lord lord avebury sus act that is one of crime prevention <e> <s> we have enough laws which deal with people who commit an offence but we have very few laws which give the police powers to prevent a crime being committed <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon said i think that there were only offences recorded of trying the door handles of cars <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> in a way that strengthens my point because if there were only cases at one given time and i know that the noble baroness who sits opposite is also a magistrate you get the feeling that half of those came up in your court <e> <s> anybody who sits in the magistrates courts in central london has <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord vaux very much for giving us the opportunity to speak on his unstarred question this evening <e> <s> there are so many aspects of this question that one could tackle but i hope i have never been guilty of the crime of going on at great length in this chamber and i do not intend to spoil my own record <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the minister for that reply it is rather disappointing that however it is worked out the number of man training days is fewer <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister is aware i am sure that he is of the high cost-effectiveness of the territorial army <e> <s> i wonder also whether he will speed the review because in these days of very specialised training it is important that a volunteer army receives the maximum opportunity to train <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord who has just spoken in the hope that if we get this changed for scotland we may also get it changed for the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> this has been a sore matter for many years <e> <s> i can remember resolutions at womens conferences going back a long time <e> <s> it is one of the curious anomalies that are almost impossible to explain away <e>", "<cs> i hope my noble friend lord ross will think very carefully before withdrawing the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord drumalbyn has introduced an interesting argument bearing in mind that he has been a minister <e> <s> i could name many acts of parliament consider for example the pensions acts which come into effect on a certain date meaning that people born in the wrong years so to speak do not obtain a pension <e> <s> one could cite many acts which become operative on a certain date and thereby create anomalies for certain people and that is unfortunate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady sharples for introducing this bill <e> <s> it may seem a small bill but it is important to thousands of people <e> <s> having worked for so long in womens organisations i always found that legislation which was introduced to deal with villains seemed in some odd way to fall very heavily on the voluntary organisations <e> <s> for example a simple raffle after the lotteries and gaming act became a matter of concern and worry to local groups who feared they might be breaking the law <e> <s> they were unable i recall to sell home-made wine because they did not have a licence <e> <s> they could not have a fortune-teller in case they contravened some ancient act going back to the middle ages <e> <s> so it is quite deplorable that a local authority seems to have taken the opportunity to intervene and one wonders how much work they had to do that they found it necessary in a good cause like this <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply i should perhaps say that i have no personal interest to declare in this matter but i wonder whether the noble lord is aware that a working mother who ceases to work can receive maternity allowance for weeks before the birth and weeks after or even a little longer whereas if she continues to work she forfeits the money that she would have had before the birth <e> <s> since the money must be set aside for weeks would the minister not agree that it would be more sensible and fair that all mothers should have the -week maternity allowance <e>", "<cs> my lords sensing that the noble lord is sympathetic may i express the hope that the review will come out with a fair scheme <e> <s> contributions have been made by all and it seems reasonable that all should collect <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble lord lord hawke surely there are many classic examples illustrating that the moment we divide things they cost far more <e> <s> we are all saddled with the redistribution of local government <e> <s> let me cite what has happened in my local government area <e> <s> whereas once we had two town clerks we were told that one would be very much cheaper in fact we now have five because we have administrative officers <e> <s> we know exactly what will happen if we divide up the pension fund <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise a point before the noble lord lord ponsonby replies <e> <s> i feel somewhat disturbed and i hope that i have heard the minister incorrectly <e> <s> as i understood it he mentioned the loss of the business of paying out social security benefits <e> <s> we received a very large deputation of sub-post masters not very long ago <e> <s> it was a most impressive gathering <e> <s> i was present along with other peers and i recall that the minister then gave a solemn assurance that the recommendations of the rayner report would not be taken up <e> <s> it now appears that the minister is saying that this business is to be taken away from sub-post offices <e> <s> is my understanding incorrect <e> <s> i hope that it is <e>", "<cs> it is all very well to talk about counter-balancing the loss but there are customers to be considered <e> <s> in this instance we seem all the time to be talking about the people who serve at the counter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble baroness who introduced the debate in her splendid lucid and very amusing style <e> <s> we are deeply grateful to her <e> <s> this is of course what is known in most circles as a hot potato <e> <s> you are never going to satisfy all points of view <e> <s> i suffer as indeed do possibly some of your lordships from being president of one group which wants changes and vice-president of another one which does not want changes so i am undoubtedly going to upset one or the other with anything i say this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene in what the minister might consider is a cheating action because i wish to refer to something which is not actually in the bill <e> <s> i call in aid the fact that all social security bills having had the experience of dealing with them from the front bench when in government tend to be rag bags <e> <s> in other words various things are put in which are not in total juxtaposition as indeed is the clause to which reference has just been made <e> <s> i do not intend to follow what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said other than tell him that people do not feel that the government give them any pensions at all <e> <s> most people feel and rightly that during their working life they make a contribution which were they to put it in a private insurance scheme would certainly not be subjected to every wind of change <e> <s> governments take advantage as no private scheme would attempt to do <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble viscount who has just spoken <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that i shall support his amendment but equally not for the reasons which he advanced <e> <s> i am a non-motorist and a magistrate <e> <s> i resent the constant suggestion which is made in this house that magistrates are ill-informed and irresponsible <e> <s> today we are told that they are unreliable <e> <s> i think we have made the motorist the villain in our society <e> <s> first we persuade this unfortunate person to buy a car because it helps the economy and then we tell him every time he uses it either that he is polluting the atmosphere or that he is using energy despite the fact that he is paying for it <e> <s> let him park on a double yellow line and you will see what a villain he is <e>", "<cs> i am sorry constantly to have to take issue with my noble friends on this side of the committee but listening to my noble friend i felt that i was sitting in court listening to a plea in mitigation <e> <s> i am very sorry that he used the example of drink and drugs because this is used all too frequently in relation to criminal offences <e> <s> it seems to me that if the law says drink and/or drugs that is exactly what it means <e> <s> surely if the individual concerned is foolish enough to take a drug assuming that it has been administered on the spot at the doctors surgery which is unusual he must accept that his position is no different from that of an individual who has taken a quantity of alcohol <e> <s> i feel that that example was an unfortunate one to advance <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord proceeds to deal further with his amendment i should like to say to the minister that i found his explanation very curious <e> <s> he says maybe but we are dealing with rather important legislation <e> <s> as i understood it what he said in essence was that if a particular treaty is named it must take priority over treaties that are not named <e> <s> surely that would introduce a rather strange form of government <e> <s> as we are all aware we suffer all the time from directives from the european communities <e> <s> these directives affect us all the time whereas treaties with nato and other bodies do not affect us in the same way <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord morris is on to a very important point <e> <s> i do not know what he thinks but i do not regard the explanation offered by her majestys government as very satisfactory <e>", "<cs> we do all accept that the generation we are talking about is a very proud generation and i think that that is one of the difficulties in getting over to them that this is something to which they are entitled and not something that appears to be charity <e> <s> it is very significant in

pilot of a plane would feel rather hurt if all the passengers on his plane belted up <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that <e> <s> in fact i did not get an opportunity to elaborate what i was saying which is quite usual for the females in this establishment who speak much less frequently but much more to the point <e> <s> i would only say to the noble lord that i was making the point in order to answer the curious idea that the driver of a car would feel hurt if his passenger belted up <e> <s> i said that a pilot would not feel hurt if he thought his passengers were <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he will bear in mind when it comes to the consultation the unfortunate enforcement officers who have to determine if the person is really telling the truth <e> <s> everybody from my experience as a magistrate will be on a local round whatever they are delivering <e> <s> i would warn him that we do not want any more legislation which makes it impossible to define what was in the mind of parliament when making the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord nugent on behalf again of those <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord who moved the amendment whether he would not agree that the arguments he advanced would go back to the beginning of the training boards themselves <e> <s> in other words even if as he suggests large concerns and i am sure this is true from my own knowledge did have excellent training schemes it unfortunately was not so true of certain other firms within industry and therefore it was necessary to have training boards <e> <s> so the reason for their beginning still remains and i am afraid it is one of the unfortunate laws of life that those who are doing the right thing often have to set the example to those who are not quite so good at it <e> <s> the information is something which is pooled and utilised therefore i think that if you did not have the discipline of some kind of an overall control certain industries and certain firms within those industries would not have training schemes market forces or no <e>", "<cs> having just gone through the trauma of sitting on a committee which dealt with a slightly different question namely a teacher who was subsequently dismissed and who has now appealed i support my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> the important point about any committee is that it should be properly constituted <e> <s> we cannot in the end obtain objectivity <e> <s> it is an illusion <e> <s> anybody who has sat as a magistrate knows that ones judgments are

somewhat astonished to find that greater london does not have a crime prevention panel <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it rather astonishing that we seem to be making such heavy weather of the question of

very large number of reports <e> <s> they referred in particular to the activities of the home office provided detailed statistical information about prisons and prisoners and contained various sections and subsections <e> <s> those of us who have been involved in education know that her majestys inspectors are always under an obligation to present reports <e> <s> the mere fact that a report is presented to parliament does not mean that anything is done about it unless we demand a debate on it <e> <s> i am very astonished that such heavy weather is being made of this one particular bill

the reasons advanced by the noble baroness lady faithfull i am astonished that she could suggest that no one should have any development plans because they are ultimately not carried out by

previously throughout the discussions on this bill <e> <s> is that gross income or is it what is now colloquially known as take-home pay which would be rather different <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall make but a brief speech in the hope that i am allowed to do so without any noble lord intervening which rather prolongs the debate <e> <s> i wish to suggest straight away that the mere fact that one opposes the bill does not automatically place one against the anti-litter and anti-waste campaign <e> <s> i have been a campaigner in that regard for as long as i can remember but equally i have

would like to point out to him or rather to ask whether he is aware that the regulations on the sale of alcohol and cigarettes and indeed the sale of fireworks have contributed greatly in the case of fireworks to the prevention of accidents and in the case of alcohol and cigarettes to preventing young people buying them <e> <s> it cannot be beyond the wit of the government to devise some way in which regulations can control this very serious matter from which young people have suffered not only brain damage but other ill effects <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to suggest to the noble lord that perhaps that is the discipline of despair <e> <s> i would ask the minister whether he is aware that despite the information he has received there are in fact certain very popular solvents and while the range may be great it cannot be impossible at least to limit it <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest to the debate which now seems to have moved into a realm which perhaps we have not discussed enough namely that involving people who can be affected by those individuals who are mentally handicapped <e> <s> if we insert the phrase serious harm there will be some difficulty in defining it <e> <s> i can think of at least two victims who had the misfortune to live next door to people who in the words of one noble lord who has now left the chamber might be described merely as indulging in anti-social behaviour <e> <s> i shall not tell the committee of the kind of anti-social behaviour in which the individual indulged but he was never at any point detained because he was described by a social worker merely as a nice eccentric old gentleman <e>", "<cs> i have been sitting through this debate with great interest and i am rather relieved to hear that if this is a dry run

having to plough ones way through acts of parliament to find ways of not paying vat or having an entertainment where you do not have to conform to certain laws it seems to me that we are dealing here with matters which ought to be further discussed as they could make life much more difficult <e>", "<cs> in so far as the noble lord who has just spoken is an expert would he not agree that employees certainly feel and i assume wrongly that the redundancy payment which they receive as distinct from unemployment benefit is generally physically given by the employer <e> <s> it literally is paid by the employer so they surely assume quite wrongly apparently that this is coming from a contribution directly from the employer and the state <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady trumpington on the splendid way in which she has introduced this bill <e> <s> she was very clear very succinct and very brief which is always a plus in this house <e> <s> if i may say so it is the females who speak briefly and they probably put more points than the males <e>", "<cs> it is in the minutes of the all-party retail group <e> <s> however i shall not pursue that point <e> <s> i would merely say that on this occasion i might be speaking as an independent <e> <s> the noble baroness has pointed out that this piece of legislation has been under discussion over a long

discussion it must mean that there is some need for either reform or change <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not have intervened following so many distinguished medical speakers had it not been for the

cost of spectacles <e> <s> i personally do not wear spectacles but every supper party of mine since the bill was published has been ruined by friends shouting at me that they are paying too much for their spectacles <e> <s> that may or may not be the case but i suggest that competition will not necessarily bring people cheaper spectacles <e> <s> where can one find a higher degree of competition than in the car repairing industry <e> <s> nevertheless the charge is just to look under the bonnet <e> <s> can that be put right by an act of parliament <e> <s> call in a plumber and he will charge

can bring many undesirable elements in its train so there are misconceptions flowing from many of the arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord renton for introducing this subject today and for the topical nature of the debate which he probably did not appreciate when he first put down his motion <e> <s> if the noble baroness who has just sat down is the bottom of

whether they have this right to say that they are christians and do not wish to work <e> <s> i am not going to say that it is right or wrong but why do we select one particular trade or profession in inserting a qualification like this <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord forgive me <e> <s> is there a definition of what is a holiday resort <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble and learned lord who has just sat down and i apologise to my noble friend here <e> <s> this is an example of a debate in which we minor peers feel very inadequate <e> <s> we are now listening to a slightly

thinking that as was the case when i did a lot of work for widows one cannot collect two benefits from the state at any one time and that in the event of a widow being employed but receiving sickness benefit she would lose her widows pension <e> <s> this seemed to me to account for the fact that the married woman has opted in the past for the lower payment because in any case if she became a widow she was not going to benefit <e>", "<cs> may i trouble the minister again <e> <s> he replied originally that the widow could receive another benefit as well as a pension <e> <s> first he said one could not and then corrected himself and said that one could <e> <s> listening carefully to the ministers speech i thought i heard him say in the early part of his speech that the widow would receive sick pay but not sickness benefit <e>", "<cs> but not sickness benefit <e>", "<cs> in other words the ministers first answer was correct and the information sent to him which he corrected himself he should have corrected in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down he appears to be extremely knowledgeable as a great commuter and customer of british rail can he explain why they found it necessary to invest in pulling down a perfectly good station at victoria when they cannot find the money to invest in research <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask for a little clarification on this amendment <e> <s> i understood the minister to say that there were exemptions in the case of traders having licences granted by the local authorities <e> <s> i cannot understand the logic of that and how they would not be just as much of a danger even though they have a licence from a local authority if they are in the positions specified in subsection <e> <s> they would be just as dangerous if they were at a lay-by on land by a motorway or on a verge whether they were licensed or unlicensed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt but i do not follow the logic of what the noble earl has said <e> <s> if i am unlicensed and am in a lay-by it is a dangerous position and how will it be less dangerous if i have a licence <e> <s> i think we agree that it is bad legislation to have four exemptions in a new clause <e> <s> there will be all sorts of problems because of that <e> <s> people will argue that they were licensed or had a reason <e> <s> the moment you put in exemptions you are in trouble <e> <s> but what i cannot follow is how you are not a hazard in any of those positions if the council has licensed you <e>", "<cs> how can the government say that competition will bring about lower prices in view of the fact that it is the government who have forced the british gas corporation to increase the price of gas <e> <s> to my knowledge many people took gas appliances because gas was far cheaper than electricity as a form of energy <e> <s> however because of the recent act the british gas corporation has been forced to increase its charges <e> <s> so how on earth can competition bring down the price unless the government are going to maintain that the british gas corporation must keep their gas at a high price whereas the competitor will be allowed to supply gas at a lower price <e> <s> it is a totally unfair situation which i am sure no government could defend <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support the minister from the experience of my own borough where the introducton of small starter businesses with the assistance of the local authority is not only providing work but may i reassure the noble viscount bringing in rate income as well <e> <s> therefore this does not represent a hand-out without any kind of recompense <e> <s> in the borough their physical appearance is right and they seem to me to be a splendid acquisition <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene mainly to congratulate the noble lord lord renton on introducing the bill <e> <s> in the debate on law and order i referred to the violent crime now

make up their rules as they went along actually issued guidelines to adult education outside these statutory authorities in which they indicated that no vat was chargeable on activities concerned with statutory authorities <e> <s> why has there been a change of action here <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that he is not strictly correct in that assumption <e> <s> the guidelines are the means by which the vat officers impose what is seen by adult education authorties and i speak as one who has had many years in the womens movements as a tax on genuine activities of an adult educational nature <e> <s> when you challenge it you are told that they have certain other guidelines which are not revealed to the ordinary individual <e> <s> perhaps the minister can tell me how this can be dealt with within the law <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in order to get a secretary in london he would have to pay and the kind of work in which she would be engaged

not unfortunately present during the second reading of the bill but having listened to the noble lord lord mishcon i find it all rather astonishing to say the least <e> <s> the noble lord cited the case of a woman who i understood him to say had committed manslaughter and who was denied a widows pension but he did not mention unless i misheard him infanticide and murder <e> <s> bearing in mind

prisoners <e> <s> the prisoners are in prison because they have committed offences <e> <s> presumably these are very serious offences or they would not receive that kind of sentence <e> <s> i feel that while we are appealing so sentimentally for kindness and humanity and i hate to disagree with my noble friend lord longford for i know that like me he cares for the victims we should remember that they are there for a reason <e> <s> if they have not got any hope i am afraid that in many cases neither have the victims <e>", "<cs> i am in favour of the amendment but i am a little confused

englishwoman i should like to support my noble friend on the front bench in his plea that names should be left as they are <e> <s> so far as english constituencies are concerned i think that i can console my noble friend by pointing out that people who come from the great city of bristol will never talk about coming from avon and somerset nor will people from liverpool talk about coming from

retirement pensioners certainly widows receive possibly an identical amount <e> <s> we are told that the length of time between the calculation and the actual starting of a given benefit has to be something like five or six months <e> <s> it has always amazed me why governments do not adopt the methods that other institutions do <e> <s> it is different when people are going to take money away from you <e> <s> increased prices can be introduced the following day <e> <s> british rail have a very simple method of increasing the price on tickets <e> <s> they use a rubber stamp <e> <s> i suggest that they do it on millions of tickets <e> <s> they are not concerned with only a few <e> <s> for a long time we had a marking on a cheque card <e> <s> the banks told us that that could automatically be read as if you wished to withdraw that amount <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies i should like to follow up that point <e>", "<cs> forgive me my lords but i have been in the house quite a while and i do not think that that is correct when we are debating a motion <e>", "<cs> thank you my lords <e> <s> having established that right i will go on to the next one <e> <s> i wanted to ask the minister a question with reference to the chaperon <e> <s> we went all through this dreary business a long time ago and i thought we had cleared it but apparently we have not done so and we are now going to rescind various things that were dealt with in great depth a long time ago <e> <s> i cannot really think that the people whom the government consulted were very different from the women that we talked to all that time ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i may put on record following what my noble friend and the noble lord lord donaldson said that as i understood it the roman catholic archbishop has already stressed his condemnation <e> <s> it would be most unfair if that were not recorded <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that this is womens engineering industry and science year i see that some ministers did not even know this so i am happy to give them this piece of information will it be the policy of her majestys government through any body which is created or through any existing body to encourage more girls to enter the spheres of engineering industry and science <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> i have sympathy for the amendment <e> <s> however having for many years been concerned with bodies which have been set up by governments it seems to me that it is virtually impossible for them in the end to be independent of government <e> <s> i was on the national consumer council <e> <s> perhaps it is not in the same distinguished category as this authority <e> <s> nevertheless this body was set up by government <e> <s> it was noticeable that at each change of government those who were sympathetic towards the government were immediately put on to this body while the others were displaced <e> <s> the secretary of state will appoint the authority <e> <s> what certainty shall we have that the authority will be so impartial and so august that it will not be influenced by any change of government <e> <s> one of the unknown rules in the art of government is when were in we put our friends in and when theyre in they put their friends in <e> <s> how we are going to change this i shall be very interested to hear <e> <s> i do not believe that the amendment carries sufficient weight to achieve that end <e>", "<cs> may i point out to the noble lord the curious argument he brought forward when he spoke about the outgoing calls <e> <s> surely the telephone is a means of communication and if you live in a rural area it is your incoming calls which are of the greatest importance <e> <s> i recall living on a farm for six years in the bad old days when it was under the post office when we had the telephone and no electricity no water services and certainly no gas services but we were in direct communication which was vitally necessary on a farm that was seven miles from the nearest town and two miles from the nearest village <e>", "<cs> i should like to reinforce what the noble lord lord somers has said <e> <s> i was rather saddened to hear the noble and learned lord the lord advocate whom i admire so much once again enunciate this magic virtue of competition <e> <s> as a mere consumer suffering from the appalling effects of several competitive firms who have tried to do some building work for me i can say that this is an example of the most highly competitive and the most inefficient industry there is <e> <s> let us get right away from this strange idea that competition brings efficiency cheapness and the best thing for the consumer certainly this is not proven <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in something of a dilemma <e> <s> first of all i should like to congratulate the noble earl on bringing the bill forward again and i do hope that this time it will go through both houses and become law <e> <s> he indicated in his opening remarks looking at me that he was very sympathetic towards the point i would be making that could not be embodied in this bill <e> <s> this i appreciate and i will not make any difficulties in the passage of the bill <e> <s> but i could not miss the opportunity to bring forward a slightly different point which would have meant widening the bill <e> <s> having listened to my noble friend lord mishcon i begin to think that had it been widened to the point i am going to suggest it might have met his case more than this bill does <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be happy to provide the noble lord with the evidence that at the moment there is a big gap in the law but that has nothing to do with the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister tell us how many of the voluntary organisations those for the disabled the elderly and so on have put in submissions in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i should like to support the noble earl in this bill and to say that i am only sorry we could not have widened the terms of reference <e> <s> i feel that this is something that many people suffer for which there is no recourse in law <e> <s> i only hope that in future we can have another bill which will widen the terms of reference to include all private premises <e> <s> i wish this bill a fair passage through the other house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to welcome the bill <e> <s> although i must apologise for having to leave immediately afterwards i felt that i must remain to speak because so few peers from this side of the house appear to be partaking in the debate <e> <s> i should like to follow the most reverend primate if i may still so address him in the line which he has taken as regards this particular matter and to say that we are concerned about not only the protection of the young but also the prevention of crime <e> <s> unfortunately those two matters are very closely linked <e> <s> every week we read about appalling crimes being perpetrated by young children <e> <s> one such crime highlighted last week concerned the death of a particular film stars mother which was caused by three boys aged <e> <s> if it were unique it would be horrible <e> <s> sadly it is not unique it is something which we now read of constantly to say nothing of the kind of curruption that we see in other areas <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i recognise that it is not perhaps as explicit as it should be <e> <s> the noble baroness who introduced it made the point that she was speaking particularly of the voluntary services <e> <s> i too have had the privilege of being a worker in the voluntary services for a large part of my life <e> <s> the important factor which we will miss as the noble baroness said is that you can have pioneer services in the voluntary sector which you would never have in the state sector <e> <s> we should not have had pre-school playgroups had the voluntary sector not first gone into that <e> <s> many of us tried for years to get the state to move on that and it did not do so <e> <s> that is to name but one aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords how does one follow that <e> <s> i should just like to ask the minister how she can forecast in such precise figures how many people are going to die next year that she can tell us exactly what it would cost if she increased the death grant <e>", "<cs> my lords it is one of the mysteries to which the noble minister may not have the answer <e> <s> how can she explain in such precise figures what it would cost to increase the death grant unless she knows precisely how many people of different ages will be dying next year <e>", "<cs> it is rather curious that the noble baroness lady gardner should suggest that these amenities which london transport offers have come from the management without any inspiration <e> <s> the organisations that work with the disabled have had to work hard to achieve all the different amenities not only on london transport but also on british rail and <e>", "<cs> i believe that if there is someone who is particularly concerned and knowledgeable about the interests of the disabled there will not be the need to lobby quite so energetically <e> <s> the disabled will have a direct link with someone who can put forward their particular needs <e>", "<cs> i feel that each time the minister explains the situation it makes it more horrendous <e> <s> as a consumer i can recall using the green line before we had the advent of the national bus company and what appeared to be a tidying up <e> <s> there used to be a mysterious operation where one went a certain distance on one bus and transferred to another outside london which is what the minister is now suggesting will happen <e> <s> he used the words a transfer of services <e> <s> one of the great advantages about having the operation that we have now is that the customer surely that is who we are talking about the passenger has the least inconvenience in using one of these services <e> <s> fragmentation frightens me to death <e> <s> i have a feeling that it will be like the days of the pirate buses which the minister will not remember with everybody rushing about the streets and half the time the passengers not knowing what was happening <e> <s> what we want in london is a service that we can recognise <e> <s> another great advantage is that the buses are all the same colour now <e> <s> they used to be different colours using different stops <e> <s> anybody who has experienced that does not want to go back to it <e>", "<cs> before we return to the general principle of the amendment i wonder whether the minister could explain to me what we are talking about <e> <s> this is the first reference to greater london <e> <s> the definition of greater london in the bill is <e>", "<cs> but the bill talks about the administrative county of greater london and the government are to abolish the administrative county of greater london <e>", "<cs> before the vote is taken as a mere magistrate i should like some clarification of this point because it is becoming more and more confusing <e> <s> i understand that on summary conviction a person guilty of the offence will be liable to a fine not exceeding <e> <s> a magistrates court cannot impose a fine of that kind so the case would have to go to a higher court in which case surely the appeal would be against the higher court and not against the magistrates court <e>", "<cs> i should like to underline what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> i think one can reassure lord monson that no magistrates court would impose a fine on an unemployed lorry driver the sad story of course that we always hear <e> <s> i have always understood that hard cases make bad law and i think that it is wrong to legislate on the basis of a rather remote case <e> <s> we all know the kind of people we are considering and discussing in this bill <e> <s> i think it would be totally unreal from my knowledge of the courts <e> <s> magistrates always have to take into account sometimes in the opinion of some of us far too much the means of the offender so i see no possibility of a heavy fine being imposed in the circumstances outlined by the noble lord <e> <s> i think we can give him that reassurance <e>", "<cs> my lords to offset the case mentioned by my noble friend is the minister aware that an informal campaign initiated by the national chambers of trade has issued notices to very many shops <e> <s> this is an entirely voluntary action on behalf of shopkeepers which i think should be applauded <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important that when older people apply for concessionary fares they should be able to do so with the greatest degree of dignity <e> <s> i find it abhorrent to see older people lining up to have their photographs taken because this condition has now been imposed <e> <s> the noble baroness lady gardner stressed that it would be a monopoly if the issuing of these passes was left to the post office <e> <s> it would equally be a monopoly if only local authority establishments were allowed to issue them because establishments are few in number are usually centralised and are much larger buildings <e> <s> it is mainly the elderly who apply for permits for concessionary fares and they are easily confused <e> <s> they know their local post office and <e> <s> as my noble friend has said they are used to going there for their pensions <e> <s> in particular sub-post offices are very friendly and helpful to these older people <e> <s> we must recognise that this is not a question of money <e> <s> if we are going to save money let us not be saving money at the expense of the older people among the population <e>", "<cs> as a mere magistrate i am particularly puzzled and perhaps the noble lords on the other side can explain this <e> <s> how can we have a discussion on an appeal which has been lodged against something which is still in the form of a bill <e> <s> surely it cannot have been against this it must have been against the original act <e> <s> therefore is this discussion quite relevant to the clause we are discussing now <e>", "<cs> i find myself listening to this debate with an increasing air of astonishment <e> <s> i wonder what kind of a world some of your lordships live in <e> <s> i am all for a code of practice for enforcement officers <e> <s> i only wish that we could have a code of practice for the criminals it would make life a great deal easier for many of us <e> <s> i understand that one of the duties of our police force is to prevent crime as well as to detect crime and arrest crime <e> <s> i will give your lordships an example from my own area just a few nights ago <e>", "<cs> i would ask my noble friend on the front bench whether he would extend this argument to the number of times that one is held up while demonstrations go down streets <e> <s> if the motorists were to say that they did not want that they would be described as extraordinarily obstructive very difficult and undemocratic <e> <s> i can recall many occasions one not too long ago when i had been endeavouring to get to a very reasonable function but when it took me twice as long to get there as the trip had usually taken and when finally i had to walk because a group of people living in this country were demonstrating over something that they did not like about the government of the country from which they had come a matter about which we could do nothing at all <e> <s> in our country we pride ourselves on the fact that we are liberal and allow anyone to demonstrate <e> <s> but i suggest that if we are to keep records of the number of times that we are held up it will be equally relevant to keep records of the number of times that we are held up because of road diversions which often happen quite quickly and on the spur of the moment <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend on the front bench further explain the example he gave <e> <s> it was not clear to me whether the gas board operators actually removed the articles having made unlawful entry or whether they made the entry with the police and then other things were removed <e> <s> that was not very clear when my noble friend was illustrating his amendment <e>", "<cs> i am still not clear <e> <s> my noble friend said it was lawful entry <e> <s> is he saying that in the absence of the person who owns the house i have not actually met this before and this is what puzzles me the gas or electricity board can effect entry and cut off the supply <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow what has just been said <e> <s> we have been listening to two noble and learned lords and i do not have that privilege but i should like to suggest that it is unfortunate to keep referring to a trivial offence <e> <s> it may be trivial to the person who is not concerned with the offence but when i have been sitting as a magistrate i have found that offences which were described as trivial were certainly not trivial to the victim <e> <s> if the noble lord wants an example i suggest we consider causing loss of or damage to property <e> <s> in the central london courts we used frequently to see that two or three young people generally young men were arrested because they were hanging around piccadilly circus station oxford street or westminster abbey in order <e>", "<cs> these people have not been seen to be attempting to rob <e> <s> that is the whole point <e> <s> i thought the noble lord was referring to paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend on the front bench lord ennals <e> <s> once again we have heard the old argument about costs <e> <s> we are not talking about costs today <e> <s> we are talking about health <e> <s> that is a totally different thing <e> <s> like many of your lordships i was given the doubtful present of two pairs of spectacles which one could buy presumably if this amendment was accepted <e> <s> they were described as magnifying glasses <e> <s> they were accompanied by a document stating that most people over that is a little frightening because i still do not have spectacles and i am a little over do not suffer from any other eye defect than that given this strange name on the marshalled list <e> <s> in other words they need only to have magnifying glasses <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to raise a small point <e> <s> i have not raised it before but i shall raise it again in the future if necessary <e> <s> in the interests of accuracy i would point out that we have not actually had the old age pension for about years it is now referred to as the retirement pension <e> <s> the minister calls it the old age pension and so does the amendment <e> <s> i am sure that that term is more emotive but it is not accurate <e>", "<cs> i was waiting for one of your lordships who is a magistrate to draw attention to the fact that we are talking about the sentencing remarks of the judge or magistrate <e> <s> so far we have heard reference only to the judge <e> <s> as i understood it when i was trained as a magistrate one was told quite clearly and definitely not to make sentencing remarks that one would be criticised if one made remarks from the bench <e> <s> as i recall them the headlines in newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount the leader of the house a very simple question <e> <s> he stated that the judicial inquiry had found in favour of the government <e> <s> why then is it necessary to appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend lord ennals <e> <s> i have listened intently to the deliberations on this amendment but i am still not clear about why dispensing opticians in the national health service will be treated in the same way as suppliers of optical appliances who are not dispensing opticians <e> <s> to my simple mind this suggests that people will be able to buy spectacles without first having been to a dispensing optician who will have given them a prescription for lenses <e> <s> this is the point which people are concerned about <e> <s> the minister did not explain the difference between the two <e> <s> if there is no difference why is it necessary to include in the bill a clause of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord withdraws his amendment one of the fascinating features of this house is that although members spend a great deal of time thanking one another for their <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> is she aware that the people of hong kong a territory always loyal to the british are greatly concerned about the future <e> <s> they feel that any agreement which is arrived at must be acceptable equally to the people of hong kong as to britain and china <e> <s> is she aware that they are particularly concerned that there may be a loss of rights such as their basic law or indeed some of their other freedoms <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord lord diamond answer me this question <e> <s> as i have understood it the training and qualifications of a valuer certainly in relation to property are totally different from those concerned with accountancy <e> <s> are we talking about a valuer in the sense of a valuation officer <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to the ministers replies to each of these amendments <e> <s> as one who has worked in the field of voluntary social service for many years i am still confused about one particular issue <e> <s> when one received grant aid as i have done on many occasions directly from a government department one was always told categorically that none of this was to be used in a local context <e> <s> it appears to me that under this bill it will be the government department which will determine what are virtually local monies to be spent by the voluntary agencies <e> <s> this has not been fully explained <e> <s> in other words is it a government department which will determine whether the merseyside council for social service can continue <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness withdraws her amendment i wonder whether i could have an answer to my question <e> <s> if i could just emphasise <e>", "<cs> my lords i meant amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords no i thought i spoke before she withdrew it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i might help the minister <e>

ministers statement that the government are now considering the licensing of the independent security organisations <e> <s> a quarter of a million people are employed in private armies in various security companies throughout the country <e> <s> if this is to be a flexible affair as the minister has suggested at some stage security companies might be brought in to carry out certain duties <e>

shocked to discover that the drivers are often recruited through a simple advertisement about a week before the event <e> <s> i should like to think that they are all vetted i am sure they are but we must recognise that if we are to use <e>", "<cs> my lords in many ways i will follow the noble lord who has just spoken but i wish that he would not refer to the ordinary decent criminal <e> <s> if we stopped using such euphemisms we would know precisely what we were talking about <e> <s> it seems to me that if someone is a criminal he is neither ordinary nor decent <e> <s> i too follow a great deal of what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said possibly for the first and only time when speaking in this house <e> <s> yesterday i had the pleasure of hearing the noble lord lord chalfont and i take his theme <e> <s> as i recall he ended his speech by saying that we must embark on a policy of preventive and pre-emptive action <e> <s> he was of course speaking about security on the

over-simplification but then <e> <s> i am not a lawyer <e> <s> the noble lord lord wigoder in his comments on the last amendment gave an example of where a prosecution was discontinued and he made reference to a caution <e> <s> as i understand it a caution can be administered only after guilt has been admitted <e> <s> i could not quite see the connection with discontinuing proceedings because surely if one discontinues proceedings that is the end of the matter <e> <s> secondly if it is decided by the director to discontinue proceedings when they are brought by the police would that rule out the possibility of a citizen taking out a private prosecution <e>", "<cs> sitting here this afternoon i have been wondering whether we are sitting in a judicial capacity or as a committee which is making laws <e> <s> we have had the advantage of listening to noble and learned lords of varying ranks <e> <s> they have used even the jargon of the courts and talked about submissions <e> <s> we are not submitting evidence but are debating the framing of a bill an act of parliament <e>", "<cs> i think that when my noble friend reads <e>", "<cs> i realise that if i could use colloquial expressions

lords bearing in mind that the minister will appreciate that his right honourable friend sends directives to local education authorities may we ask that he should encourage schools to continue or

said <e> <s> i too was in at the beginning of the original campaign a long time ago <e> <s> i should like to suggest to the minister that perhaps the time is ripe to go back to the womens organisations who are admirable campaigners when their help and support is enlisted <e> <s> this case will have highlighted the necessity for them to get the message through to every woman and i would

like to ask the minister <e>", "<cs> it is not actually my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he has visited any schools recently <e> <s> i speak as an ex-teacher and i think

concerned <e> <s> the minister said that nobody seems to be very bothered about this subject and that the police do not seem to have any trouble <e> <s> i can only say speaking as a magistrate in central london that we frequently have people in front of us who are described as taxi-drivers but then when you ask them about it you find that they are minicab drivers <e> <s> perhaps we were just unlucky in getting people who had offended against the law <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness the minister not agree that anybody who works in the field of medicine and health cannot afford to be described as a baddie and that they must all be goodies <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down as a member of the select commitee also who had very carefully kept quiet in all these debates as befits those who are members of a select committee may i say that he did not make it absolutely clear that he was speaking entirely for himself <e> <s> if noble lords are to consider anything it is the report and not the noble lords understanding of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i would first say to the noble earl that i do not speak in any malice or envy but i do speak in some anger and i am going to use this opportunity in three minutes to say why i intervene in this debate <e> <s> this decision of the government to accept the proposals and this is what we are talking about and not necessrily the report on the top peoples salaries is in my judgment against the problem of the teachers both cynical and philistine <e> <s> if we look at the recipients the armed forces the judiciary and the civil service it reveals very clearly the low regard with which this government holds education and health <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the minister has told us of the extra customs and excise officers can he confirm that this is in fact a real addition <e> <s> the customs and excise officers themselves have said that there has been a depletion of in their number <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that he has attacked the educational system notably the teachers <e> <s> the teachers have to struggle with an impossible situation which is not made any easier by the governments refusal to accept their genuine case for some kind of recognition of their salaries <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a fascinating debate though at times i thought we were debating a bill called the abolition of sunday bill rather than the shops bill <e> <s> since this seems to be an afternoon for declaring ones family ties ones conscience and ones religion i should like to say at once that i am a catholic that i go to church but that i call in shops mainly jewish or asian ones on the way home <e> <s> i am not sure whether the almighty will declare this against me when i come to the final reckoning but i think there is a certain element of hypocrisy in some of the arguments that have been advanced <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister when we are to have a debate in this house on crime prevention and the involvement of the community <e> <s> we have discussed prisons and prisoners at great length but so far as i know we have not discussed crime prevention during the last months <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a different point and i have given notice of this question to the minister <e> <s> i shall not detain your lordships long as i am merely a layman and not of the legal persuasion <e> <s> as your lordships probably know there are already operating about a quarter of a million people who act as security personnel and who carry out various duties before handing suspects over to the police or before suspects are brought before a magistrate <e> <s> i notice that in the original act section said that any person may arrest without a warrant <e> <s> these security people store detectives and so on operate under the citizens arrest procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him whether he would agree that other professional people such as doctors and certainly a large number of other professionals are frequently called out in the middle of the night to carry out their duties <e> <s> there is no question of limiting the time that they spend according to the amount of money they receive <e> <s> the noble lord presents his own profession as being extraordinarily mercenary <e> <s> surely if they really have their clients interests at heart the fact that they only receive a certain amount of money will not stop them carrying on for longer than two hours <e>", "<cs> speaking as a teacher <e> <s> i should like to know what is the difference in clause between the advancement of knowledge and education or training <e> <s> when i worked in education i always thought that i was advancing the knowledge of my pupils <e> <s> there must be some distinction that is not immediately apparent <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that many women were very appreciative of the speech that he made in connection with this particular and horrible crime and hope that in future further discussion can be taken forward on several points in connection with this offence <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow the point made by my noble friend lady lockwood <e> <s> the amendment refers to <e>", "<cs> i shall not speak at length but i should like to point out to the noble lord who has just spoken that this amendment would not help the situation that he described <e> <s> i was extraordinarily shocked to hear the noble and learned lord lord denning whom i admire very much make the immoral suggestion that groups which should be allowed to remain and not be subject to the local authority are the groups which are already open <e> <s> these groups are already open illegally <e> <s> if ever there was an advancement for squatters rights it seemed to be given to me by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> because they had not kept the law so far that would be all right and they could carry on but if anyone else came forward they would be subject to the law <e> <s> i would only say because somebody else is going to say it that when the noble lord lord graham was speaking against the same kind of bill in the other place he actually advanced the argument that it would be inconsistent to have one local authority granting this and another local authority granting that <e> <s> one problem is that if you speak too often in either place your speeches are always liable to be quoted back at you <e> <s> the noble lord has obviously changed his mind in the meantime and it might as well be me who tells him as anybody else <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this is an example of why the teachers are so demoralised <e> <s> here they had the support of their own governors their own people and their own authority <e> <s> yet their own education authority would not support them <e> <s> i can give the minister many such examples <e> <s> there must be some way in which the government can intervene to make sure that those people who are doing a very difficult job have the proper support of the people who are there to give it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord stewart of fulham for introducing this subject <e> <s> education is never received with any great enthusiasm and certain other subjects would have filled the benches all around the house <e> <s> i think it is some indication of what we feel about education <e> <s> lloyd george was supposed to have said once that the welsh

going to get community education we have to get our own perspective on education right in the first place <e> <s> i speak as a former teacher and one who has been involved in what was laughingly called adult education for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for taking the opportunity to raise this important question <e> <s> there is perhaps not much more that i need to say following the eloquence of the right reverend prelate my noble friend and so many contributors to the debate <e> <s> i am however an ex-teacher the mother of a teacher and the mother-in-law of a teacher <e> <s> i have always been greatly concerned with the teaching profession and latterly especially with the church schools <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i would <e> <s> i give the noble baroness that one particularly as i am very fond of her <e> <s> it is so easy to solve a problem round a table or in this chamber <e> <s> it is only by standing at the sharp end of the job that

supplementary question asked by the noble lord opposite is it not a fact if it is will the minister confirm it <e> <s> that those at pensionable age now have paid towards their pensions before they retired and are certainly not a burden on the working population <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that rather unsatisfactory answer <e> <s> is he aware that being old is getting younger all the time and that now men of are made redundant and are then faced with advertisements which say no one need apply if they are over <e> <s> the americans have a law of this kind <e> <s> may i ask her majestys government to look again at the possibility of introducing some age discrimination legislation particularly in relation to employment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the national union of teachers and indeed so far as i know the nas have as the government would wish on every occasion gone to their members and balloted them before they moved any further in any of the discussions <e> <s> surely this is exactly what the government wanted <e> <s> therefore they can hardly as would seem to be implied by the question of the noble lord opposite condemn the unions if they wait for the decision of their members before they move to the next stage of any negotiations <e>", "<cs> i do not want to detain the committee but there is to me a sense of unreality about this <e> <s> i should like to assure the noble and learned lord lord denning that had i been present he would have had a supporter on this <e> <s> speaking as a grandmother i am trying to imagine wanting to marry my grandson-in-law <e> <s> the mind boggles <e> <s> i have never had any of these kind of feelings but perhaps i am old fashioned in these matters <e> <s> if we are to spend a lot of time discussing this there is a curious air of unreality <e> <s> are there cases that we can feel are going to be presented that would need the attention of the law <e>", "<cs> in the catholic church we have an even more complicated list of consanguinity and that for our sins would cry to heaven for vengeance <e> <s> i also used to enliven myself with reading that and one or two other things not having understood them nor hopefully having committed any of them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this question just to clear my own sense of sanity <e> <s> did i understand him to say that he declined to appear on television because if it was not him it was someone very much like him who had to deal with the fact that he had used the word entertainment in relation to the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend draw the attention of his right honourable friend to the fact that this is yet one more job which the hard-pressed teachers will be expected to take on and will his right honourable friend consider this when he is looking at the very meagre salaries he is willing to grant them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord harris of greenwich first on his excellent speech and secondly for getting the motion on the order paper <e> <s> i had a motion on crime prevention and the involvement of the community which rested calmly for a year and nothing happened <e> <s> of course we have constantly debated the plight of prisoners about whom we are always very worried <e> <s> we debate the plight of the prisons and why they are falling apart <e> <s> we raise questions about these problems but we do not pay enough attention to the questions of law and order and certainly not to the question of crime prevention <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment for various reasons one of which gives me <e>", "<cs> like the right reverend prelate unfortunately i could not be present on second reading and so in that sense i shall be trespassing a little <e> <s> i do not like the bill <e> <s> i find it an interference once again with the teachers <e> <s> so far as i know no one has ever proposed that there should be a governing body of a hospital with five satisfied or dissatisfied customers sitting on it with four doctors and so on <e> <s> why is education always singled out for interference <e> <s> if the amendment will make it possible to have fewer governors i am in favour of it <e>", "<cs> before the right reverend prelate withdraws the amendment i am not quite certain that he would agree that the noble earl has given him a complete answer <e> <s> if this is going to happen or indeed if this is already possible within the bill i am not quite clear why the amendment would not add to an existing situation <e> <s> in other words if the government have nothing to fear from the amendment surely they could gracefully accept it and then come back with one of their own at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> meetings between individuals at any stage of a bill are really no answer to your lordships when dealing with the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> i do not know what the right reverend prelate feels about this but as chairman of the governors of an aided school i am very concerned that there should be no interference at all with their existing control and powers <e> <s> this we must watch very carefully throughout the passage of the bill <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lord mcintosh replies not for the first time i find myself in the dilemma of having to contradict noble friends on my own front bench or at least debate with them <e> <s> but perhaps that is one of the privileges that we have in your lordships committee <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who is a layman in these matters who has tried rather hard to follow this discussion i wonder whether the noble lord lord hacking when he replies can enlighten me about the reference to esau and jacob <e> <s> so far as i can recall neither was a legislator or a lawyer <e> <s> i am waiting to learn the erudite connection in his introduction of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to follow my noble friend in his theme <e> <s> of all the time-wasting and expensive bills that we have ever been presented with this has to take the cake <e> <s> at a time when the teachers are trying to get a little extra salary we are to spend money on ridiculous things like training governors <e>", "<cs> this happens already <e>", "<cs> i should like to take this opportunity following my noble friend and following what has been said by the noble lord lord ritchie to speak about this mysterious clause <e> <s> one learns and my short exercise in government taught me always to beware of that part of a bill called miscellaneous <e> <s> it always contains the most contentious clauses as far as i can see <e>", "<cs> since my noble friend mentioned me although i had no intention of speaking on this particular amendment i naturally rise to the bait that is laid <e> <s> i do so whether it comes from my own front bench or from the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter who has not actually laid me any bait in this particular discussion <e> <s> but i would question very much whether people who are trained for voluntary exercises actually perform them much better than those who adopt the old system of sit next to nellie <e> <s> like the noble lord here i went on the bench when there was no formal training <e> <s> i do not think that i was ever a very bad magistrate because i have got reasonable intelligence and i was given an idea of what my particular functions were <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that so many of these indians went to live in hong kong at the direct invitation of former british governments surely it ill behoves us to leave them in this situation when we come to the time when there are apparently still very elastic guarantees which we made with the red chinese <e> <s> will not the government reconsider the situation of this quite small number of citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many of us will regard this amount which has been given we assume as an interim arrangement as a very meagre contribution to a great profession <e> <s> since we shall again be asked to consider the high increases to be awarded to judges civil servants admirals and various other persons of that kind i hope that this is not going to be the end of the story and that there will be a real increase of some meaning to the teaching profession when these talks conclude <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was not present during the original debate i too should like to welcome the new clause <e> <s> i am a little curious as to why it is in this position as it sits rather uncomfortably between discipline and finance <e> <s> i should have thought that the provision was more relevant to curriculum <e> <s> this is how a curriculum would be composed and sex education included <e> <s> but i sincerely welcome the new clause <e> <s> in a bill about which i am not enthusiastic it seems to be one of the better clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point which the noble baroness is making and in view of her own professional interest i appreciate her reasons and i respect them <e> <s> however i am a little amazed that she does not seem to know unless the situation has changed that part of a teachers training is or certainly was basic first aid skills <e> <s> i am bound to say that when i was teaching i always had the idea that if you did now know enough about a subject you could do far more damage by doing something rather than by doing nothing <e> <s> i do not think that any child ever suffered as a result of what i did not do but certainly a child may have suffered if i had attempted to set a broken leg <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware of the effect of his reply on womens organisations <e> <s> it is very disturbing that he has now said that there were not enough women of quality in commerce industry and the professions to be considered <e> <s> i wonder whether he has considered the effect it will have when people read that tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to our two maiden speakers <e> <s> i am very sorry that the noble lord lord brocket is not in his place because when i listened to his speech i felt that i need not have remained to make mine <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has also picked up this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord ardwick for giving us the opportunity to call attention to the current threats to our urban and rural environment <e> <s> i should also like to express my appreciation and thanks to the right reverend prelate for his splendid maiden speech <e> <s> when he described the wonderful forests i felt that the words of the poet were certainly true where everything is lovely and only man is vile <e> <s> i often feel that the real threat to our development is mankind himself and the government will be glad to know that i am speaking generally and not for once calling upon them <e>", "<cs> i find the arguments of the minister and the noble lord lord vinson almost dickensian <e> <s> they were advanced many years ago about the employment of women <e> <s> women were cheaper we all know that particularly in the clothing and catering trades <e> <s> they were the only labour that

people are of course not as experienced <e> <s> but the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> can the minister explain a small point of procedure <e> <s> did get it wrong <e> <s> he said that he would be moving that the clause did not stand part of the bill <e> <s> what is the point in discussing the amendment and making a decision on it if he is to move that the clause does not stand part of the bill anyway

fund officer <e> <s> if that were so <e> <s> why was it necessary for us to have the rehabilitation of offenders act which wrote into law that certain facts could not be revealed <e> <s> there has never been any evidence that the police or the people concerned with handling these people revealed any information and yet we had an act of parliament which made it clear to everyone that these facts would not be revealed <e> <s> i cannot see any objection to having this written into an act of parliament under similar circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be possible for her majestys government to declare a bank holiday for the royal wedding <e>", "<cs> i wish to support my noble friend <e> <s> this is a very curious anomaly <e> <s> most of us have been members of quangos or of

certain age one is assumed to be useless <e> <s> however one is certainly never asked to be co-opted because it suits the convenience of a particular group so that later they can reinstate one in a full position <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say to the noble baroness that perhaps it would be more helpful if she did not actually give us an explanation no doubt provided to her in a brief that this is a simplification <e> <s> i cannot think of anything more complicated than this <e> <s> we had algebra in the gas bill last week and now we have it in this bill as well <e> <s> it really confuses

person who has to cope with these things find it <e> <s> i feel that it is very bad that as we reach this stage of the bill the government make this drafting change and then tell us that it is for simplication <e> <s> i do not say that we shall vote against it because i do not understand exactly what we would be voting for or against and i suspect neither do the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i would only point out that while the amendment corrects the date in this case there seems to be some confusion about whether the government want th or th april <e> <s> when one comes to the next page

and the noble lord on the alliance benches it seemed to me that they were doing anything but promoting unity <e> <s> surely you do not stir up the other side if you intend to promote unity but perhaps i have misunderstood the nature of this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords on these occasions i always feel that i should apologise for intervening on bills which seem to be dealt with almost wholly by practitioners in the law many of them of great standing and very learned <e> <s> however i think it is important to remember that many people have strong feelings about the issues raised in this bill <e> <s> therefore natural justice is something which we must also consider and this is the moment when we must consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister recommend that these films are passed to the bbc who would use them until they fell apart <e> <s> we see the same films certainly every christmas <e> <s> it seems to me they never waste any films and i think that an archive would be an absolutely invaluable source from which they could steal for their screens <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to congratulate the noble lord for bringing this very simple concise and explicit bill before your lordships <e> <s> i should also like to say how grateful i am to the honourable member of another place who managed successfully and it is much more difficult in that house to bring this bill to a good conclusion <e> <s> i think we can safely say that this is a bill which cannot have anybody rising either in this house or the other place to criticise any of the clauses <e> <s> it is simple and deals with something which is a very real menace <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hutchinson has again said every lawyer in the chamber knows <e> <s> we are not all lawyers <e> <s> i constantly find throughout the discussions on bills such as this criminal justice bill that the whole of the legally-trained members of your lordships chamber address everybody else as though they were equally part of that profession <e> <s> sitting here remembering my experiences as a magistrate i got the impression that many of the lawyers were there simply to confuse the people who sat on the bench <e> <s> i used to think at the beginning of a case that i knew what it was about <e> <s> after i had listened for an hour to someone like the noble lord lord hutchinson i did not know what it was about <e> <s> i should just like to ask him to explain how an innocent <e>", "<cs> perhaps one of these noble lords who have all the explanations for every act of parliament could assist <e> <s> the paragraph reads <e>", "<cs> i should just like to pick up the points made by the noble lord in relation to the mesh and electrification <e> <s> i have as i am sure have other members of the committee been on a platform in the london underground tottenham court road to be precise and quite recently seen two rats very calmly sitting there in the middle of a highly electrified line <e> <s> we must dispose of the idea that the rat if it intends to get through will not do so <e> <s> i should like to have some reassurance from the noble lord on where the information is to be found that these animals do not carry rabies <e> <s> how do we know that <e> <s> this little island has been the one place which seems to have been immune from rabies in the whole of europe and there must be a reason <e>", "<cs> i should just like to take up the point made by the noble lord lord mountevans in which he asked why do it now why not do it before <e> <s> that seems a very curious argument <e> <s> if it is found that something is not entirely satisfactory and cannot immediately be changed there seems to be no reason why it cannot be changed before construction <e>", "<cs> my lords on the front of this excellent report we have the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that we shall not hear again the words legitimate use <e> <s> i emphasise that there is no legitimate use for something like the texas star or a rambo knife <e> <s> nobody could dream up a legitimate use for those <e> <s> i hope that what i am talking about is clear <e> <s> offensive weapons can only be used as offensive weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords mine is perhaps a rather simpler question <e> <s> are these regulations mandatory or voluntary <e> <s> my work on british standards has shown me that voluntary codes are almost useless but mandatory codes work better <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment i should like to stress the importance which he has just underlined of the other child witnesses <e> <s> we are not here dealing with ordinary children <e> <s> once again in this chamber and too often we are so concerned about the rights of the accused <e> <s> these witnesses are going to be very intimidated even by the noble and learned lords who sit here <e> <s> they intimidate me and if i were a nine years-old abused child they would certainly intimidate me <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrupting the noble lord but if he were to spend a few hours going round some of the womens organisations he would hear what they have to say about it that is not based on the popular press but is based on cases which many of them can actually speak of from personal experience <e> <s> i found the noble lords statement that rape is different according to the victim very dangerous <e> <s> rape is rape against whoever it is committed <e>", "<cs> as regards subsection would the noble and learned lord explain why the scottish offence of wilful fire-raising does not appear to be an offence in england <e> <s> is there a different definition of that offence <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether the government considered this matter when deciding what was the retail price index on which they based the increase in pensions <e> <s> was it a matter of the government giving that figure first and then giving this <e> <s> pensioners do not buy cars but they need electricity <e> <s> i should also like to know what the industry is competitive with it is a monopoly <e>", "<cs> i should like to make an unreserved comment in that i appreciate the very sensible points being raised by members of the committee who are lawyers <e> <s> understandably they seem to have dominated the debates on the bill <e> <s> but i think that sometimes a layman should have a word <e> <s> i feel that here the government are honouring a promise which they gave and i should particularly like to thank the home secretary because he made a promise to me when we talked about this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that her majestys government are dedicated to helping small businesses may we at some stage have an amendment to the landlord and tenant act <e> <s> i ask this question because whereas a tenant in a house has a limit a business has no limit and property developers which are taking over the whole of london to the detriment of small businesses are in full sway at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am not going to have any support from my front bench or the back-bench opposite i should like to say <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a question <e> <s> i do not want the chief whip to tell me that <e> <s> this is a question which is relevant to the previous one <e> <s> service charges can be questioned if one is a tenant in a private property <e> <s> if one is in a business enterprise they cannot be questioned <e> <s> do her majestys government consider that there is a difference which should be looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble and learned lord and support the amendment in so far as it should be right to have summary trial rather than the expensive and long drawn-out procedure of going to a higher court <e> <s> the only thing that concerns me as with the noble and learned lord is whether you should have a fixed penalty <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that rather makes it worse <e> <s> i remember that when i was sitting as a magistrate the street traders had got it weighed up <e> <s> when they came into court in great marlborough street and saw three women and we were sensible judges they would pass the bush telegraph out to the others saying we have got three women in there today <e> <s> who is coming up next week <e> <s> the answer would be oh so-and-so to which the reply was oh he is very easy meat <e> <s> your lordships must know that people have their own assessments <e> <s> thieves and villains are not idiots <e> <s> they are only idiots when they are caught <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that we are once again making very heavy weather of a rather simple matter <e> <s> surely you cannot have a monopoly just anywhere <e> <s> for example at a normal wedding there are dozens of amateurs taking pictures from the same angle because it is the best angle <e> <s> i think it is total nonsense <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> if they are of importance then surely it is essential that the examples given should indicate the importance of the amendment <e>", "<cs> if a change in the clause will stop us having our eardrums damaged by this ghastly muzak which we now get in every restaurant and every pub i should be delighted to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid the noble lord has not chosen a very good example <e> <s> originally as those of us who are magistrates know the driver had to be brought to court and the owner did not <e> <s> therefore we had to introduce special legislation <e> <s> you can never assume <e> <s> the noble lord uses the example of common sense <e> <s> we all know that the law is not common sense <e> <s> it all has to be spelt out in black and white <e> <s> you cannot assume anything <e> <s> i think that his example shows that he is actually in favour of the amendment <e>", "<cs> if a mere laywoman may tangle with noble and learned lords it seems to me that the noble and learned lord the former lord chancellor who has just spoken has turned us back to what the bill says which is very reasonable <e> <s> he referred to the advice assistance and representation which have already been given and he suggested that they have more or less grown up informally <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister a direct question <e> <s> if and when electricity is privatised will it be recognised that the prime motive is profit rather than safety <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow what my noble friend has said <e> <s> unless things have changed local authorities were bound to accept the lowest tender <e> <s> even if they do not do so they will still be attracted by the lowest tender <e> <s> i wish to mention an example of contracted labour <e> <s> i went to a conference in one of the universities quite recently it shall be nameless <e> <s> the meals were not good and the university was dirty <e> <s> when i questioned that i was instructed by the person organising the conference to write to the vice-chancellor <e> <s> i was told that the university was now obliged to use contract labour <e>", "<cs> i hoped that the minister would make the point <e> <s> the right reverend prelate has every right to speak in this chamber <e> <s> it is not a question of being political he speaks as a christian and we respect him for it <e>", "<cs> my lords has the right honourable friend of the minister considered the effect of this provision on the colleges which he is proposing as distinct from the work of the local authorities which may in some ways have a conflicting interest <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness withdraws the amendment if she is going to do so i deplore the fact that it is left to the noble baroness to put this point <e> <s> will the minister use the same argument a little later in this debate in connection with another famous clause <e> <s> it seems to me that there is no objection to underwriting a principle that is accepted and is now endemic in law <e>", "<cs> i should perhaps warn the committee that if the verdict goes against what some people would like then we may see dogs lowered on ropes over the top of the balcony <e> <s> they are much less bother than humans <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness confirm that the voluntary schools have never deviated from this <e> <s> they have always provided the act of worship throughout the whole period whichever government were in office <e>", "<cs> my lords i raise a slightly mundane matter which only a lay person could intrude into this rarified atmosphere <e> <s> my understanding is that barristers and solicitors receive rather different fees <e> <s> why is it necessary to have two more on this board <e> <s> will their advice and information be different <e> <s> why is it necessary to have two more shall we say highly qualified people <e> <s> solicitors will hate me for this <e> <s> there is no doubt that the make-up of a board such as this has a germane function in relation to people at the grass roots and it would be unfortunate if it is made more costly to operate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to correct the record with regard to something that has been said by the noble baroness lady young <e> <s> i can speak as one who has relatives my son and daughter-in-law who are teachers in catholic schools in london <e> <s> i can assure the noble baroness that far from removing uncertainty this will further demoralise staff which is already struggling in appalling conditions <e> <s> uncertainty looms up every day <e> <s> staff do not know how many teachers will be retained nor the character of the borough by which they will be taken over <e> <s> i think that it must be placed on record that whoever else may like this action it is certainly not the teachers of london <e>", "<cs> i do not often take issue with the noble baroness but this is an entirely different point <e> <s> the duties of a home help are very clearly defined <e> <s> i was at their conference quite recently <e> <s> they are not paid at a rate at which one would expect them to take temperatures or to look after bodily functions <e> <s> why we use these mealy-mouthed words about what this is all about i really do not know <e> <s> but it is very important that this should be clearly spelt out <e> <s> i am quite certain that home helps are not aware of this now <e>", "<cs> just before the amendment is taken away there is a small but rather mysterious point <e> <s> on page it is stated <e>", "<cs> perhaps this argument would appeal to the government <e> <s> if one has a complicated system of pay-out it is always more expensive to administer <e> <s> i have heard the arguments that the minister has advanced tonight applied to retirement pensions <e> <s> the question is asked why do people who do not really need it take it <e> <s> but our fiscal system makes sure nobody gets too much money out of the government <e> <s> the moment one exceeds a certain limit the money all goes back again <e> <s> it is totally nonsensical to suggest that there are many wealthy people collecting a lot of money from the state the noble lord knows that to be untrue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not an international diplomat so i will put a direct question to which i do not expect an answer <e> <s> will the minister tell us how far we have received assurances from the chinese government that some sort of elected representative government will remain after the takeover <e>", "<cs> i felt very sad when i listened to this debate particularly after the comments of my noble friend if i may so address her as we are part of a minority group in this house being female <e> <s> when i was very young i used to act rather badly i think <e> <s> i appeared in a play called <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down and before my noble friend replies to the amendment i should like to ask him at the outset whether we are going to hear every time and at great length the argument that competitive tendering is accompanied by increased efficiency <e> <s> in my experience competitive tendering is certainly accompanied by a reduction in costs because the labour is not paid as much as the people who previously worked for the authority <e> <s> i challenge that there is increased efficiency <e> <s> before we hear any more of this from the government we will get it on other amendments i ask them to bring supporting evidence to show that when there has been a change of system they have noted increased efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords before we return to scotland which is the subject that we should be discussing <e>", "<cs> have we passed that <e> <s> oh good <e> <s> the arguments are the same <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble baroness that no one has suggested that there should be no tendering <e> <s> my comment was a different one <e> <s> each time the government mention tendering <e>", "<cs> my lords following my noble friend who has just spoken i should like to remind the house that we are talking about equal opportunities <e> <s> i speak as one who has been involved in the fight for women practically all my life and we still have the fight before us i am afraid <e> <s> i notice that we are all slipping back into the mr mrs syndrome and we must be careful that we do not find ourselves becoming the little woman behind the throne which i thought went out with madame pompadour <e> <s> this is about sex discrimination equal opportunities <e> <s> i went through the legislation originally because i was in government then and i can recall speaking to a group of nurses because there was discrimination against men becoming nurses and midwives <e> <s> we are talking about equal opportunities for both sexes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the point made by the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> i have the honour of being president of the health and safety officers <e> <s> one knows that the building industry is notorious for contracting and sub-contracting <e> <s> at the moment i am in the process of dealing with a development by a well-known property developer in westminster <e> <s> it is appalling to watch the behaviour on the site <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> before he leaves that point would he not agree that the closed shop has been known for centuries far better to the professionals the lawyers the accountants the medical profession than it was ever known to the workers and it seems to work very successfully to their advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies to the amendment <e> <s> i should like to raise a slightly different point <e> <s> the noble lord commenced his remarks by saying that he had declared an interest and he asked whether he had to do so on every occasion <e> <s> as i understand our standing orders in the house one does not have to declare an interest i thought that requirement merely applied to the other place <e> <s> the issue is slightly confused i do not expect the minister to answer as obviously practising barristers who are also peers practise in the morning and come here in the afternoon to discuss laws but they do not declare an interest <e> <s> perhaps at some stage we could learn what is meant by declaring an interest <e> <s> is it directly related to a particular financial interest <e> <s> the noble lord described himself as an author <e> <s> it seems to me that we do not need to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords it was nine <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the hospital is sited in the borough which sold cemeteries for p i am sorry i overstated the amount for p would it not be wise for the government to consider whether much revenue will be gained before it disposes of this very valuable hospital <e>", "<cs> exactly <e>", "<cs> with his vast experience of newspapers surely the noble lord does not believe what he reads in them <e> <s> the ones with which he is concerned certainly do not speak the truth <e>", "<cs> can the minister explain whether retirement age has the same meaning as in section <e> <s> in other words is it one age for women and another for men <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies perhaps i may seek clarification <e> <s> i had the privilege of speaking at the dispatch box for five years <e> <s> i was told that you speak for the government or on this side you speak for the opposition <e> <s> if you wish to express your own views you go to the back-benches <e> <s> can we have clarification of what the noble lord said at the outset <e> <s> he said he was allowed to express his own point of view <e> <s> was he expressing his own personal point of view or was he expressing the views of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> there is a provision which already refers to payment <e> <s> it would seem to include the element that needs to be covered by an amendment of this kind <e> <s> it provides <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the splendid publicity awarded to this item which i have not seen will now result in most of your lordships and a number of people outside this chamber viewing it <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment and to follow the points made by the noble baroness and the mover of the amendment <e> <s> i always feel slightly hypocritical when we discuss alcohol in this place <e> <s> in this building one can drink for almost hours a day <e> <s> i say to my noble friend lord soper that that proves that availability does not mean that people drink more <e> <s> otherwise all the members of the committee would be lying about in a state of alcoholic stupor <e> <s> i know that some people say we do but it is not true <e>", "<cs> this is the only time that i would say it <e> <s> we like to eat together outside the home <e> <s> the lovely idea which my noble friend seems to have of everybody rushing home for sunday lunch is a thing of the past <e> <s> young people have a joint meal on sunday evening at six oclock because the children all want to do different things <e> <s> for heavens sake let us bring ourselves a little up to date <e>", "<cs> i wish to make a historical point before the noble lord sits down <e> <s> does he agree that during the time of strict prohibition laws in america there was more drunkenness than at any other stage in its history <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment because it highlights the total hypocrisy of the british people in this matter <e> <s> i was once taken on a trip round london which showed that one could drink for about hours a day <e> <s> certain laws are relaxed in the case of premises situated near docks even when the docks are no longer there <e> <s> the point <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support my noble friend <e> <s> after all he is a licensing justice and speaks with some experience and reason <e> <s> i do not believe that he is looking for more work the licensing justices like all justices are unpaid and do the work because they believe in it <e> <s> he is simply trying to tidy up the position if that is not the wrong expression to apply to a bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i would have spoken on the other two amendments but that was not necessary because my noble friend stated the case so well <e> <s> this is a frightening piece of legislation <e> <s> apparently so simple it will give the government great powers <e> <s> i notice use of the in word corporate <e> <s> we are told that everything is corporate and that a body is corporate <e> <s> there is nothing in the definition clause to say what a body corporate is <e> <s> it obviously comes under etc <e> <s> if the government are to hand over our water authorities and electricity boards to the private sector they should at least have the courage to state it in the bill <e> <s> that would spell out exactly what this small and apparently innocent bill is all about <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies perhaps he could clarify one point <e> <s> in his speech he rather concentrated on water using the example of the poacher and gamekeeper dealing with pollution on the one hand and polluting on the other <e> <s> how would he apply that argument to electricity <e> <s> surely an electricity authority does not pollute at the same time as supply <e> <s> in my view any comment he makes is tied up with those two matters right throughout the bill <e> <s> they may in fact be separated in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> i am not speaking from the cross-benches <e> <s> is the minister aware that there have been several examples and if the noble lord wants to know the examples i can send him the information of at least three sites which have been closed in by the city of london fathers <e> <s> therefore at this stage it is essential that we should ensure that that does not happen in this ease <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate particularly my noble friend lady stedman <e> <s> i would not attempt to answer the technical points that the minister mentioned <e> <s> equally i hope and i feel certain that the house would not deprive a select committee of the opportunity to pass the bill <e> <s> the technical points can be worked out <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down is he saying that there is no act of parliament where a statement is repeated twice <e> <s> i find this fascinating having sat in the house of lords for a long time <e> <s> surely it is quite common in acts of parliament to have the reiteration of principle <e> <s> this cannot be the reason why the government are not accepting the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the minister is not completely quoting the act <e> <s> the iba specified that any concession that was given must include more british material than material bought in from other countries <e> <s> now tv-am is certainly contravening the act <e> <s> i hope the minister will accept that it may be the responsibility of the government to see that the act is carried out completely <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> i have been both a teacher and a chairman of governors <e> <s> the parent governors are one of those bright ideas that are spreading across the land <e> <s> parents can intimidate teachers <e>", "<cs> it is all very well to say no but we all know that bosses with influence intimidate their workers <e> <s> if the idea is so good i wonder why the public schools have not adopted it <e> <s> they do not have a governing body of parents <e> <s> in denominational schools it seems that only one person will be nominated by the denomination or church in whose interests the school is conducted <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall when i first came to your lordships house that we had a firearms bill before us at that time <e> <s> lady summerskill who was then alive was always strongly opposed to boxing and she certainly opposed firearms <e> <s> i remember her saying you wont get very far with this you know because their lordships just want to have these firearms to shoot a few harmless birds and animals <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not have the privilege of being present at second reading <e> <s> perhaps in his reply the minister can say what constitutes vermin <e> <s> my limited scientific knowledge suggests that it is confined to rabbits and rodents <e> <s> surely it does not include pheasants and so forth which some of your lordships enjoy shooting <e> <s> if that is so i believe that it should be spelt out a little more clearly because there appears to be quite a latitude <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i support my noble friend because like the noble baroness i have seen this situation in the courts and the terrible tragedies which follow <e> <s> however i am rather fascinated by this term co-habitee <e> <s> is it the one which is referred to in the papers as the live-in lover <e> <s> i always find that slightly insulting as he has often brutalised the children and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord withdraws his amendment perhaps i may ask the minister one question <e> <s> he referred to lettings to students as did the noble lord and to holiday lettings <e> <s> the only reference to either of those which i can find in the bill is to holiday lettings <e>", "<cs> my lords a great deal of hot air has been generated on this issue <e> <s> i wonder how many noble lords who have spoken have ever seen any converted or specially-built houses <e> <s> what does such a property have in it that makes it so difficult for an able-bodied person to use should he wish to do so <e> <s> why were those houses put in a special category in the first place in other words <e> <s> they are just houses or <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> the government have had the courage to introduce the act <e> <s> i am sure that courage was required because their supporters are mainly those interested in shooting <e> <s> surely in the long clause defining exemptions the government have covered every possibility and it seems unreasonable to introduce such an amendment for what appears to be only a single occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall make only one short speech in deference to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it is obscene to be discussing this subject in the week when a year-old boy borrowed his fathers car and killed four people <e> <s> if a year-old borrows a gun on one set of private premises but moves to another presumably he will have the gun on the journey <e> <s> the age of is quite young enough <e> <s> therefore we must watch very carefully that we do not change the law so that there are people of early age having all the facilities which in some cases they cannot handle <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that last weekend young people from junior crime prevention panels met at a national conference in wales organised by the police and commerce <e> <s> it was very successful <e> <s> no minister of the government had the time or ability to attend that conference <e> <s> can he explain why that was so <e>", "<cs> my lords i must press this matter <e> <s> when i was a minister in the government there was no way that the government of the time would have allowed an important conference like that organised voluntarily by the police and commerce to have no representation at all from her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i heard that <e> <s> perhaps i may say that in passing <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords first on a point of information is it not unusual for the minister to find it necessary to reply to the two front benches <e> <s> after all we have here not a statement but regulations <e> <s> i am a little concerned because i am a back-bencher and i notice as was mentioned the other day that back-benchers do not have an opportunity to speak <e> <s> if we are likely to have additional front benches because more parties are being formed i think it is important that back-benchers should have their say <e>", "<cs> my

on the side of crime prevention <e> <s> therefore anything i say about this bill does not imply that i do not accept that there is a problem <e> <s> there is a problem with hooliganism in shopping centres and at railway stations <e> <s> it is not always the product of people going to football matches <e> <s> we would be very foolish if we thought that by merely implementing the provisions of this bill we would cure the problem of hooliganism <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as an ex-teacher and as a mother and grandmother <e> <s> i have never struck a child in my life it is really not necessary <e> <s> if you think about it it is an admission of your own inability to control <e> <s> i do not wish to pursue that point but i should be happy to give counselling to some noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it probably is not necessary for me to add to the speeches that have already been made all supporting these amendments so splendidly <e> <s> i should just like to follow the point made by the noble lord lord henderson and the noble baroness lady macleod <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that if somebody leaves youth custody or prison they are helped when they immediately leave <e> <s> to me if often seems ironic that people who have committed offences actually get treated far better in society than those who have never done anything other than being left as these young people have been left in the position of having to be in care <e> <s> they are very vulnerable <e> <s> the necessity to live may make them turn to crime and this is a very important point to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that to some degree the noble baroness answered her question in her concluding remarks <e> <s> some noble lords may know that i hope to introduce a private members bill to stop the nonsense of using age as a criterion <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down does he not agree that there are year-olds who should not be driving <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether the definition of terrorism has a different meaning in english legislation from that in northern ireland <e> <s> today the bomb at bristol university was described in the press as terrorism but it was not political <e> <s> it seemed to be something to do with animal rights <e> <s> does terrorism have a different definition according to the country in which it is perpetrated <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to prohibit the use of age limits in job appointments training schemes promotion retirement and advertising of jobs to make other provisions relating to employment and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> i too have remained silent rather an unusual role for me <e> <s> we are constantly hearing about the fma the new magic body <e> <s> i can discover only one reference in the bill which is to the licensing authority <e> <s> who are the people who will sit on this magic body <e> <s> will they be operating under the old pals act <e>", "<cs> i should like to express my support for the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> i do so especially because i would not like to see him labelled as sexist <e> <s> that is certainly nonsensical and is obviously a term used by the kind of person who likes to be called ms and who talks about a chairperson <e> <s> that is not what the argument is about <e>", "<cs> as i was saying i understand that someone said it is overcrowded that of course is a different matter <e> <s> in any event there are fewer prisons for women than there are for men <e> <s> therefore certainly the small number of women who go to matches now as we have just heard from the noble lord will not go if they have to pay to join the membership scheme in addition to paying for a ticket <e> <s> that is the whole point <e> <s> moreover we do not yet know how much such membership will cost but it will all add to the cost <e> <s> if the minister can only see his way clear to make this small exemption then he will really be showing us that the government have the interests of football spectators in general at heart <e> <s> indeed they need the popularity <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual when addressing your lordships house i brought a prepared speech but as the debate has proceeded if you can call it a debate i have had to change what i am going to say <e> <s> i am probably the first to congratulate the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor on having the courage to attack this profession <e> <s> when he was writing the green paper i do not believe that he thought it was an attack but the nature of the response has shown that that is how the profession see it <e> <s> i say to it that this government have brought in a great deal of legislation to deal with trade unions the teaching and the medical professions and to take over the community enterprises of water electricity and transport <e> <s> in each case the cry has always been competition and cost-effectiveness bring better efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords i would always include the noble and learned lord in courtesy and certainly the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor because it is his debate <e> <s> i would certainly expect him to be here <e>", "<cs> as a hard-working company secretary of a trade association i begin to wish that i had not come this afternoon because i have a feeling that i have been breaking the law <e> <s> i have carefully studied the companies act but i must confess that i had never thought of my accountant as also my auditor <e> <s> they are two separate people <e> <s> at the annual general meeting my accountant has a definite role which is not necessarily confined to the figures that he presents as an auditor and in sending out notices <e> <s> i am in the throes of changing the articles of association <e> <s> i have given the days notice <e> <s> i thought that i had done all the right things <e>

be arraigned in court and tried no doubt by one of their lordships whom i condemned last week and therefore be condemned to the tower presumably <e>", "<cs> i should like some clarification <e> <s> i found it rather unusual that a noble lord who will be involved in the running of a certain authority should make comments which seem to come from his background with another committee with which he is concerned <e> <s> surely his advice will be useful when he actually occupies that post <e> <s> however at the moment he seems to be influencing the decision in something in which he has a pecuniary interest <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the noble baroness <e> <s> as befits our sex she has moved the amendment with brevity and clarity so i shall not spoil the record by going on at length <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate on this bill <e> <s> i am bound to say that i expected opposition and all kinds of difficulties to be raised <e> <s> i have never known any idea that i have had or project that i have started in which difficulties of <e>", "<cs> i should like to underline what my noble friend has just said and ask the noble lord lord renton this question <e> <s> how many times have we heard the argument that as this will already be covered in the bill we do not need it again <e> <s> it is better to have it in the bill twice than not to have it at all <e> <s> there is always the danger that there will be something slightly different in the amendment from the words already contained in the clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up a point made by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i think that there is a great necessity for the amendment <e> <s> at present we are discussing another most important bill in this place <e> <s> we are taking over another industry from which one should never make a profit <e> <s> the person who will run that industry has been a member of another place <e> <s> indeed i believe that the appointment has already been announced before the bill has passed through parliament <e> <s> that seems to me to be a slightly strange way of operating democracy <e> <s> the assumption is that the bill will <e>", "<cs> i wish to make a comment that has nothing to do with the amendment <e> <s> after listening to my noble friend on two occasions while discussing this amendment i suggest to the minister that since the office of director appears to be very open including the salary we have here a potential candidate who would be absolutely splendid <e>", "<cs> will the minister tell the committee where the enforcement officers are to be <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow through from the remarks of my noble friend but take a slightly different line <e> <s> if the government are not prepared to accept the inhumanity involved in this measure surely they must recognise that there are laws to deal with matters of public health when there is no water supply available even for sewerage <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am sure that the opposition would be delighted to co-operate and make life easier for him if he were to withdraw the water and electricity bills in favour of this bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend and to introduce a slightly different note <e> <s> water companies will be handed over to private enterprise <e> <s> i have a splendid example of one of the privately owned water companies whose charges were increased by per cent <e> <s> not unnaturally a number of customers questioned that <e> <s> the explanations are fascinating <e> <s> it was asked whether the increase was to meet requirements of privatisation a view that had been circulated <e> <s> the water company denied it <e> <s> members of the committee will note that i speak of a private water company <e> <s> however some of the charges in which it has had to indulge are very curious <e> <s> it required substantial sums to meet expenses incurred in connection with an abortive takeover bid from the cook islands <e> <s> i find it fascinating that islands on the other side of the world want to take over the water in west kent <e> <s> further expenses were incurred in relation to the purchase of the companys shares by a french undertaking and so one goes on <e> <s> the increase was nothing to do with the improvement of the quality of the water or the treatment of sewage but with bad business handling <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord lord jenkin one question <e> <s> as i understand capitalism in operation if you instal more outlets the product eventually becomes cheaper because more people take it <e> <s> why does that not operate in the case of water <e> <s> if more people are drawing off water and using the sewerage surely it should become cheaper and not more expensive <e> <s> the noble lord appears to advance a strange argument that because he personally had to pay the charge there is something most unfair about it <e> <s> the whole system under which we shall operate is unfair therefore it is curious to try to single out one example <e> <s> i am interested to know why he does not argue his own case <e> <s> as i understand it marks and spencers goods become cheaper as it makes larger quantities to sell to customers <e> <s> why does that not apply to water <e>", "<cs> can i ask the minister another question <e> <s> throughout london we are cursed i hope to mention this in wednesdays debate on traffic with property developers <e> <s> in practically every street in the centre of the city buildings are being pulled down and larger and higher buildings built <e> <s> therefore more electricity water and gas are used because there will be more tenants <e> <s> there is no new infrastructure apart from being new in the sense that it has replaced the old <e> <s> let us take grand buildings at trafalgar square <e> <s> an enormous superstructure has been built <e> <s> i should be interested to know whether new sewers are to be built <e> <s> i doubt it <e> <s> is a different sort of water system to be installed <e> <s> i doubt that <e> <s> is that regarded as something new for which a charge will have to be made <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will give way <e> <s> these are not houses but offices which are sold at a ridiculous price something like per square foot <e> <s> i am not talking about houses and the minister knows that <e> <s> i am talking about blocks of offices which grow higher and higher are occupied by more tenants and therefore use more water and require more sewerage <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord strabolgi <e> <s> we must keep in mind what the bill is about <e> <s> it is about handing over water to private companies <e> <s> we can dress up the clauses but that is basically what is behind it all <e>", "<cs> this is a genuine inquiry on my part <e> <s> is the act of appointing directly by the secretary of state to the monopolies and mergers commission peculiar to this bill <e> <s> as i understand it appointment to the monopolies and mergers commission in the first instance came from a totally different department <e> <s> with similar provisions for privatisations in the water bill will persons be appointed directly to the monopolies commission by the secretary of state <e> <s> i ask only because it is very relevant to the people who are at present on the monopolies commission <e> <s> it is very much linked with whether such people have the expertise not only for this but for other matters that they will be handling <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> i am interested in the assumption i have not sat on a board as the noble baroness has that now one is actually asked these questions <e> <s> that is not my experience <e> <s> i recently had an extension to my house in which extra points were installed <e> <s> it was discovered that there was not the right amp mains or something leading i gather to a dangerous state <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord responds perhaps i may intervene for a moment <e> <s> i am becoming a little concerned and somewhat confused in this matter <e> <s> unlike the noble lord i am not so well-informed as regards kilowatts and various other matters <e> <s> i find increasingly that when one wishes to purchase an item one is expected to give an answer to all kinds of questions <e> <s> indeed it is becoming increasingly a do-it-yourself world <e> <s> i notice that the minister refers each time to the public electricity supplier <e> <s> surely the bill is all about the industry not being publicly owned any more it is going to be privately owned <e> <s> plcs are not public unless i have a total misunderstanding of the words <e>", "<cs> that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it is not necessary to intervene even briefly after the masterly speeches we have heard from this side of the house <e> <s> i should however like to pick up the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter on one matter <e> <s> i should hate it if he was not present at any debate <e> <s> he made a rather curious point that as socialists we are conservatives and do not like change <e> <s> i remember the fantastic changes that the labour party brought to this country <e> <s> i remember when the railway workers saw for the first time that the community and the workers owned the industry for which they had slogged so long <e> <s> that was only one of many <e> <s> it was the labour party which changed the whole system of our national health and education services <e> <s> we have changed for the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that this is the time for the government to show that throughout this bill they can accept some very practical amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister a simple question <e> <s> i heard this morning on radio that shrimps are now coming through the london taps <e> <s> the system of which we are very proud in the thames water area appears to have been producing either something extra or something that was not expected <e> <s> is that in anticipation of the takeover so that we now have a profit motive and the shrimps can be sold or are they part of the effluent <e> <s> i ask that question quite seriously because it is an interesting development <e> <s> i find that shrimps are very expensive when i buy them in restaurants <e> <s> i should be delighted if i turned on my tap tomorrow and received them free <e> <s> the minister refers to his great scientific brief and talks about look-up tables and the effect of sewage but we want an improvement if that is not too difficult <e> <s> the amendments can do nothing but add to the quality of the river and the effluent <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will comment on that example <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may follow the noble earl because i agree with him and i support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> he mentioned battersea power station <e> <s> i remember the great enthusiasm with which that scheme was set up and the fact that the heating for a large estate on this side of the river was all provided at a low cost <e> <s> it was an imaginative scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the plo has obviously utilised children in its battle against the israelis <e> <s> is it not therefore fair to record that point in any discussion that we have <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister resolved the problems of the people who have the misfortune to live on the route of the channel tunnel <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws her amendment perhaps i may ask the minister whether there is any further hope for my bill on age discrimination <e> <s> he mentioned the possibility of earning money over the age of <e> <s> perhaps that means that he is going to encourage people back into the labour market in which event therefore i hope that my bill will receive his commendation <e>", "<cs> i wish to intervene in connection with the amendment which we originally decided to discuss amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the bill is not only horrifying but saddening <e> <s> it is a clear example of what we can only describe as a return to the s when people were forced to take any kind of employment <e> <s> i do not wish to say very much because my noble friend on the front bench has covered it all <e> <s> i merely add that if people are forced to take any kind of employment very often they find it extremely difficult to return to their original employment <e> <s> their sidelines are cut off <e> <s> i plead with the government surely we have not gone back to a situation where we have to save through the most unfortunate group in the population who are unemployed through no fault of their own but through circumstances over which they have no control <e> <s> i beg the government to accept these very simple but heartening amendments which would at least make us feel that the government are not the <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies perhaps he can explain why these answers are made so complicated <e> <s> is this deliberate or is the civil service unable to explain in simple terms some of the clauses of the bill <e> <s> it seems to be assumed that we are dealing only with people who are also in receipt of other benefits <e> <s> surely people who have been made unemployed remember clearly the income they received when they were working <e> <s> surely that is a deciding factor in determining the benefit <e>", "<cs> surely the noble baroness would agree that that is not a reason for not introducing legislation <e> <s> there will always be someone outside this chamber who will find a way round almost everything we do in parliament <e> <s> however that is not a reason for not including an amendment such as this in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief because my noble friend on the front bench and my noble friends lord mccarthy and lord mellish have put the case excellently <e> <s> i am sorry that the minister did not notice that i spoke at second reading although he said that he mentioned only a few people <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware than some of us sympathise with the israeli government the only democratic government in the whole of the middle east in their fight against the plo and its various arms <e> <s> surely they closed the schools merely as a matter of security <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister assure us that the government will emphasise the fact that the hong kong people do not wish to come here in great numbers that they merely need some kind of insurance policy <e> <s> too much propaganda has been put around to the effect that million people will descend suddenly on great britain <e> <s> it is difficult for hong kong people to understand why they do not have such an assurance when they see the number of people from other countries who are living here <e> <s> each time that there is a demonstration i am amazed at the thousands of people arabs iraqis iranians and so on who are obviously living here <e> <s> from the demonstrations outside the chinese embassy it appears that a number of chinese people are living here <e> <s> we must show the hong kong people that we are behind them if the necessity arises for them to come here <e> <s> when i was there i gained the impression that they do not want to come to britain but that they want some assurance that we are behind them <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems curious that this should be an issue at this stage of the bill <e> <s> it has gone through two houses of parliament and only now been discovered <e> <s> can the noble earl also explain why that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that i have found this debate very distressing <e> <s> yesterday i went into the ladies room and there i saw a peers daughter who was blind <e> <s> she was not deaf but she was blind <e> <s> she sat waiting for somebody to come and collect her <e> <s> it came home to me very forcefully that i am lucky enough to be able to move about to hear to speak and to see <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain how he can give us those precise figures bearing in mind that we have always been told that the communist countries do not reveal those figures <e> <s> the minister has precise figures <e> <s> will he tell us how he obtains them and how accurate they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say how saddened i am that the noble baroness lady faithfull for whom i have great respect has taken this very strange line at third reading <e> <s> i have been a member of this house for a long time i find it unusual for someone to speak against their own amendment <e> <s> perhaps the point is unimportant <e> <s> but to argue that the noble baroness has had meetings with ministers leads me to ask where have the ministers been until this stage of the bill <e> <s> we all know that it is the easiest thing in the world to call somebody in and have a chat <e> <s> i would not wish to be totally cynical and say that they might offer her a seat on the front bench i do not know <e> <s> i can only say that out there are the young people whom the noble baroness mentioned <e> <s> i have worked with them the noble baroness has worked with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friends on the opposition front bench on the hard work they have put in <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate my noble friend lady jeger on the hard work she always puts in on this subject <e> <s> she made a very moving speech at second reading <e> <s> it was rather sad that the press who mentioned everybody else did not mention her splendid speech so i should like to put that on the record now <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that compensation and a non-custodial sentence do not necessarily nor should they run together <e> <s> a person who has committed an offence should pay compensation as well as serve a sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the minister did not follow me <e> <s> the question seems to suggest that reparation and restitution are alternatives to conviction and custodial sentences <e> <s> surely compensation which subsequent questions seem to have brought in is not an alternative <e> <s> compensation should be arranged even if the individual has to go to prison <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down as one who has been very keen in the womens movements can she tell me where i can find the reference to sex discrimination <e> <s> it has completely confused me <e> <s> i have searched the amendments and see no reference at all to it <e> <s> the minister referred to it and i am genuinely asking about it <e> <s> i do not understand what the reference was <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i must say that i find this argument comes very ill from a government who appear to have changed the rules that i recall were in operation when i was a minister <e> <s> we were told that we were never supposed to refer to ourselves as labour ministers <e> <s> we were members of her majestys government and we spoke as i have always understood it rather as a mayor speaks in other words totally non-politically <e> <s> we were certainly not allowed to go on any programmes the minister an check this point once we were members of the government <e> <s> in other words we were paid officers in exactly the same way as some of the people whom we are discussing are paid officers <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> we have heard this argument from the noble lord lord elton <e> <s> we are now hearing it again <e> <s> will the noble lord who has a good memory outline the matters upon which he is now basing his argument <e> <s> i cannot recall instances of our amendments being accepted when they involved finance <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to follow up what my noble friend and the noble earl lord russell have just said <e> <s> i do not wish to rehearse the arguments <e> <s> however if one debates any proposition one is entitled to a sensible reply as to why it cannot be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister <e>", "<cs> no other noble lord is on his feet my lords <e> <s> i protest <e> <s> if the government like to take nearly minutes on the first question what right do they have to cut down on the time available for the other questions <e>", "<cs> my noble friend on the front bench has evoked a strange thought in my mind <e> <s> it is all right it is not erotic <e> <s> i am not thinking of opening a massage parlour under local government funding although that would not be unknown <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the thought of computerisation strikes terror into many of us <e> <s> in addition from the private angle will the staff be enlisted from certain banks in order to improve the efficiency of the passport office <e>", "<cs> my lords i am the first speaker in this debate who was not a member of the committee <e> <s> i congratulate it on preparing this very comprehensive report but i am not sure that i should congratulate the minister <e> <s> i once had the task of having to answer questions concerning pensions <e> <s> therefore i wish him good luck in his office <e> <s> it is not the office that one enjoys most of all <e>", "<cs> that is nothing to do with me <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow up my noble friends point <e> <s> there is an enormous cost involved in calculating whether someone is to receive p more than he should <e> <s> that is really what this legislation boils down to that is pettifogging regulations on very small sums of money <e> <s> it will be costly to operate and i wholly support what my noble friend said <e> <s> the people who have to fill in these forms are the very people who do not understand them and are frightened of them <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister can give a further explanation <e> <s> what time other than the time at which the application is made would one be referring to <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow on from the remarks which have been made especially those of the noble baroness <e> <s> i have gone through a phase of what might be called temporary disablement and i have not yet received any money from the one who knocked me down <e> <s> i notice that several members of the committee are on the board of the particular group to which i refer and therefore i am giving them due warning across the chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the prime minister will receive exactly the same pension as a man at a given date which has nothing whatever to do with being male or female <e> <s> surely if the government can sort out that matter they can sort out this issue <e>", "<cs> i have a simple question to put to the minister <e> <s> as the amendment refers to scotland and the legislation relates to the community charge and rateable values surely it was dealt with in the legislation in the last session <e> <s> the community charge <e>", "<cs> i am an ex-teacher and a sassenach but i hope that i can contribute to the debate <e> <s> this is one of the many occasions on which i should vote for home rule if i were a scot <e> <s> we sit here in westminster making decisions and this government always decide to try things out on the scots first <e> <s> yes they do we must not forget that the scots were the first to have the community charge and there was a scottish education bill <e>", "<cs> i find it disturbing that anyone should talk in terms of cost when discussing either education or health <e> <s> when buying furniture or houses that is one thing but there are two areas which must be sacrosanct even under this government <e> <s> you cannot possibly say that it would be more economic to send children to a boarding school <e> <s> the working class have always been very sensible they do not want to get rid of their children but prefer to have them round them <e> <s> it is very wrong to discuss anything in the bill in terms of economics <e> <s> education is sacrosanct in that sense <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not another example of why the security industry together with alarm suppliers should be properly registered with government <e> <s> we should not then have an example such as we had in deal <e> <s> everyone would be registered with government and activities would be exactly known <e> <s> the alarm companies are a clear example of private people operating in an area where they are not sure that they have the right tools for the trade <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend but on a slightly different line <e> <s> it was a little unfortunate that the minister used the example that some people do not return to work <e> <s> as i understand the law one should never legislate for hard cases <e> <s> one should legislate in order that the people who are going to carry out that law will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that if a peer is tried by his fellow peers he will not be executed even with a silken cord <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter accept that a director is paid very much better than a man on the line and that the former will frequently indulge in some activity relating to the british institute of management the cbi or the institute of directors <e> <s> he will be involved in quite a number of discussions and negotiations which will take place during time paid for by his employers <e> <s> what is the difference <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment i believe that it would be fair for my noble friend lord scanlon to have a reply to the point that he raised <e> <s> it was similar to a point which i made <e> <s> the government make great play about not attacking the trade unions <e> <s> the prime minister loves the trade unions so long as they are <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what has been said <e> <s> i feel disturbed about the small attendance in the chamber for changes in the law for scotland <e> <s> as i have said before if i were a scot i should vote for self-government tomorrow <e> <s> here we see westminister deciding important laws which are going to affect them all and there is a total <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness withdraws the amendment perhaps i may have a reply to my original question <e> <s> how similar to the legislation enacted for england and wales is the scottish legislation <e> <s> the answer cannot be difficult <e> <s> we have three experts in the box <e> <s> may i have an answer to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> in doing so i thank those who have participated in the bill from all sides of the house including the minister <e> <s> i am not a pragmatist but i am a practical woman <e> <s> i appreciate that because this is a private members bill though it will go through this house it will not have any effect as the one couched in similar terms from another place has not gone through <e> <s> nevertheless i must give warning that this is only the beginning of a campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord postulates a rather dangerous philosophy <e> <s> the suggestion that accounting is not important is very disturbing <e> <s> many people have this idea about balance-sheets <e> <s> the accountants are so remarkable that they manage

government will remember the bravery and deaths of many of our people in relation to the falkland islands <e> <s> i am amazed at the anxiety there is immediately to re-establish relations with

suggesting that that should be done <e> <s> i was concerned that it should be made clearer under the bill since this is such an important piece of legislation that the consideration would be that the

hutchinson of lullington this is an interesting example of what i particularly complained about when i sat as a lay magistrate namely the ability of the legal profession to introduce so many different

chaff <e>", "<cs> i neither agree nor disagree with the noble lord lord hutchinson <e> <s> for many years i sat as a magistrate in the magistrates court which conducts most of the business in the course of justice <e> <s> i was always full of admiration for the prosecution <e> <s> though it was usually the same person because he was often given the case by the police there was a dispassionate prosecution of the case which always engaged my admiration <e> <s> i believe the prosecutions were presented with great fairness and simplicity <e> <s> that could not always be said for defending counsel who often took a very emotional stance <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the noble lord has forgotten some of the text books which <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give up-to-date

exported or imported for gain but that that is merely a phrase and the exchange would be between medical authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in what my noble friend on the front bench and other noble lords have said in suggesting that this is in the interests of the consumer <e> <s> your lordships will know that that is my particular interest <e> <s> i have been approached by consumers organisations and they do not seem to think that this provision will help the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister considered the suggestion that i have made on many occasions and which is linked to the question of the noble lord that if we had a four-term year that would work out much more neatly as regards holidays <e> <s> so far as i know universities and other institutions are in

anywhere <e> <s> can we have some common sense from ordinary people rather than lectures from <e>", "<cs> my lords the two noble lords who have just spoken made very valid points and i shall not waste time repeating them <e> <s> i find it very ironic that the bill is entitled in the way that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has mentioned <e> <s> as regards the terrible accident at kings cross i understand that part of the problem concerning the breakdown in safety provision was due not to the fact that there were insufficient escalators but that they could not be used <e> <s> there were insufficient staff to give proper directions or to find the fire-fighting appliances <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the logic of the noble and learned lord very curious <e> <s> it does not seem unreasonable that someone should want to know who is their father <e> <s> whether we are tallking about this instance or any other situation this only adds more unreality to the bill <e> <s> we are

bench <e> <s> it seems rather curious that an inspection is to be carried out by a person <e> <s> it is almost casual <e> <s> it is as though someone just drops in to deal with what is a highly complicated business <e> <s> after all we are not exactly talking about a person who is serving fish and chips <e> <s> the amendment states that <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble and learned

government to establish a company which is said to be a private company and to operate it with civil servants and a minister <e> <s> i cannot recall this happening before <e> <s> it seems a dangerous principle to introduce <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a slightly different point <e> <s> bearing in mind our earlier discussion whichever way the government reply one has the impression

reference should be made to the person <e> <s> natural person is an unnecessary and confusing description <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many years ago to be precise when i first

following my friend if i may so describe him the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> however in relation to the closed shop i seem to recall that when we were discussing the courts and legal services bill a certain profession of which i believe he was a member showed clearly that it was not going to have any inroads made into the closed shop <e> <s> the professions have known much more about the closed shop for generations than dockers or faceworkers <e> <s> the closed shop is not in any way peculiar to certain kinds of trades <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the closed shop that is equally true <e> <s> i do not want to digress says she proceeding to do so but perhaps we might talk about the theatrical profession <e> <s> why has it got a closed shop <e> <s> it is simply because they do not want untrained and unqualified people coming in and down-pointing their job <e> <s> that is the basis of the closed shop <e> <s> it is an unfortunate title <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down will he define an older worker who is an older worker older than whom <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave i certainly support older workers <e> <s> the minister has put it slightly out of perspective <e> <s> i merely wish to know who is an older worker <e> <s> he has given me an indication of years <e> <s> luckily because there is a shortage of school-leavers these old year-olds will have the chance to obtain a job <e> <s> i am delighted about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> i should like to make a few comments in the wider context to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter to whom one cannot resist responding <e> <s> if we continue to say that this matter is complicated we shall always avoid it <e> <s> all issues are complicated according to governments <e> <s> those of us who were involved with equal opportunities from the angle of sex discrimination will know that many plans which we produced were rejected because they were too complicated <e> <s> i suggest that the complication arises from the introduction of the question of age <e> <s> as i understand it in the police force the number of years served determines the amount of pension paid <e> <s> we need to have something as simple as that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down is he aware that the non-working population as he calls them who are supported by the working population are non-working because they are unable to obtain work if they are over a certain age <e> <s> many of the non-working would be delighted to work and make a contribution <e> <s> his argument is dangerous because it may be followed by compulsory euthanasia for those who have been there too long <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord explain that in simple language <e> <s> that would make a change <e> <s> he said that the government agreed in principle but did not like it in practice <e> <s> perhaps he would enlarge because he did not give an answer <e> <s> two noble lords who are very knowledgeable on these matters have put their names to the amendments <e> <s> if it is the duty of the authority to revise existing waste disposal plans surely that would not contradict anything that is already in the bill <e> <s> it would only strengthen it <e>", "<cs> you will still get the comment <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> d reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to enter a caveat <e> <s> it is unusual to be asked to leave out a clause <e> <s> i cannot help wondering about this as i am sure some other noble lords must <e> <s> if the government had explained as the minister has now explained and had my noble friend on the front bench said then what he has said now it is curious that the house voted for the amendment <e> <s> it is worrying purely from the point of view of democracy <e> <s> i have a certain sympathy with the noble lord because i am not sure that he recieved a complete answer from the minister <e>", "<cs> the minister touched on an important point <e> <s> i understand that approximately small businesses and shops are closing because they cannot afford the imposition of the heavy property tax <e> <s> i once had a business in the london borough of westminster and paid for waste collection through the rates <e> <s> however in addition one had to pay for private waste collection <e> <s> there was no choice each business was told that it had to enter into a contract <e> <s> such business people will now be in a more difficult situation because they will be required to pay the higher property tax and the private contractors will want more money if more demands are imposed on them <e> <s> that is a consideration which the government do not appear to have taken on board <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may give another example <e> <s> it may be possible to insert an amendment at a later stage of the bill to apply the provision quite narrowly to the urban environment <e> <s> i live on a small owner-occupied rather refined estate <e> <s> latterly there has been an incursion of people who buy the properties simply to make money from them by letting them for short periods <e> <s> the people who use the houses leave the front gardens full of appalling rubbish <e> <s> so far as i know there is no law under which we can deal with that problem <e> <s> if one considers the beautiful estates such as the one in which the prime minister is interested and those in hampstead one sees that they have security personnel to look after such matters <e> <s> the rubbish is offensive to the neighbours and there must be some way to deal with it <e> <s> if the minister can tell us that there is some law under which the problem can be dealt with we shall not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before we engage in the debate bearing in mind that yesterday we were discussing in a similar setting another bill and i was told that i was out of order because i dared to challenge something that the government had said i should be grateful if we could know precisely from the clerks at the outset of this debate what the position is <e> <s> is it the case that when the government have spoken no one must come back and either ask a question or make a comment <e> <s> i should like to have confirmation on that point because i believe there has been a change since the time when the labour party was in government <e> <s> it is important that we should know what our powers are and the limits of those powers <e>", "<cs> my lords having been told what is contained in standing orders we have to watch that the minister does not get up too quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he forgive me if i ask a question <e> <s> he said we hope at some point <e> <s> may we have something more definite <e> <s> this has been going on a long time we should like something a little more definite than we hope <e> <s> by some of these people will be dead <e>", "<cs> i wish to intervene briefly to follow my noble friend lord murray and to reply in some measure to my noble friend lord houghton <e> <s> i do not understand how he can say that the measure does not fit into an environmental bill <e> <s> last week we spent some time on an amendment dealing with the state of the streets <e> <s> the state of the streets was attributed to dogs <e> <s> as i recall we could not do anything about the dogs which perpetrated the mess it had to be the person involved who was charged <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord has misread the amendment <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> it is a little unfortunate that the noble lord lord marsh seems to have used this very innocuous amendment to launch what i would call an attack on employees <e> <s> i hate to repeat this argument <e> <s> i sat through the discussions relating to lawyers and solicitors <e> <s> i talked to the journalists and printers in other disputes and to those involved in the tv-am dispute <e> <s> men and women do not strike or demonstrate on the streets unless they have a very good cause <e> <s> they have to be driven to it <e> <s> in the present climate it is essential to have everything underlined and written into legislation <e> <s> what is the first thing that employers do when they wish to save money and protect their profits <e> <s> they cut back on manpower <e> <s> that happens all the time <e> <s> this very simple amendment seems to me to be unnecessarily harshly taken up by the noble lord lord marsh <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> the minister kept vaguely referring to the opposition and how the government were acquiescing in what was suggested by tabling these amendments <e> <s> it would be helpful if he could outline the terms of the amendments presented by the opposition to see how similar or different they are <e>", "<cs> i support my two noble friends who have spoken <e> <s> i have said before that i find it very offensive that we constantly refer to the closed shop in relation to certain industries and professions <e> <s> as an historian i return to why the city livery companies were formed <e> <s> the members are very proud to belong to those organisations <e> <s> the companies were formed as a protection against people who lacked the qualifications to do the job <e> <s> that is a closed shop <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will explain to us his reasons which seem rather curious <e> <s> he referred to the money resolution <e> <s> why was that not explained when the amendments were originally drawn up in this house <e> <s> it seems very curious that they have to go to the other place and come back again before a reason is discovered <e> <s> surely a briefing should have been given to the minister <e> <s> this kind of situation happens all too often <e>", "<cs> i wish to take up a point made by the noble lord at the beginning of his contribution <e> <s> he said in a slightly patronising manner that what other countries do does not matter because we the british do something different <e> <s> i understand that the people who do not have a right to strike are invariably living in countries with a communist or right-wing dictatorship <e> <s> surely all democracies have this kind of legislation <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the ministers explanations and to members on all sides of the committee <e> <s> i wish to clarify a simple point <e> <s> does shall mean that no more than people would ever be considered <e> <s> surely may means that it is open because is a mere bagatelle as regards the situation in hong kong <e> <s> several members have cited examples <e> <s> i remember a chinese doctor of great distinction working in the hospitals <e> <s> he said to me i shall be number running dog when the red chinese come here <e> <s> i was born in china but my education was in america and i practise western medicine <e> <s> he is the type of person that we have in mind <e>", "<cs> at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many of us are glad that once again the british are shown to be considering their problems and can stand with their heads held high in the common market <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i have been at a conference at which his right honourable friend the deputy prime minister said that the government were interested in finding employment for the over s <e> <s> perhaps the minister can tell us what the government are doing since they are interested in the issue <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies perhaps i may enter a small plea <e> <s> this is the first of a number of amendments <e> <s> the minister could have said what is important in five minutes <e> <s> he has read a long and rather boring brief <e> <s> we are in committee <e> <s> perhaps members of the committee will make speeches rather than read prepared briefs which is becoming a habit <e> <s> what the noble viscount said at the end is important and the noble lord would have accepted that <e> <s> reading is one thing and speaking is another <e> <s> we are in committee <e> <s> let us have some speeches and not so much reading <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that many of us admire the skilful and courteous way in which she handles the many questions put to her on her subject <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister a simple question on this complicated bill <e> <s> does that mean that mr murdoch could control channels or programmes <e> <s> i find it very significant that that is one issue on which we have not been lobbied <e> <s> that seems to have a slightly sinister emphasis <e> <s> mr murdoch states <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask for information as this is a new clause <e> <s> which is the regional authority to cover the capital city <e> <s> perhaps the minister will write to me <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies to the minister i should like to say that this seems a piece of bureaucratic nonsense which does not stand up to a common-sense examination <e> <s> if the minister really wanted to convince the house he could take richmond as an example <e> <s> my own borough of fulham is also a very good disposal authority as well <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister who is a very understanding person whether there is some way in which we could halt the constant reiteration of the statement that the poor state of our education is due to the teachers <e> <s> it is not due to the teachers <e> <s> it is due to governments interfering with the education system <e> <s> i appeal to the government spokesman to make the point that that reiteration must be stopped <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the government should now start a campaign to make people buy british goods <e> <s> i always make a point of asking whether an item has been made in this country <e> <s> such a campaign would encourage people to buy british rather than always buying imports <e>", "<cs> my lords i admire the noble lord lord stanley of alderley for his campaign and i sympathise with the amendment although not necessarily from a rural point of view <e> <s> some of our major motorways could have very beautiful verges <e> <s> however it has often struck me that someone arriving in this country at heathrow and driving along the m will have a rather unfortunate view of england because of the state of the verges <e> <s> the north circular road is even worse than the motorways <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord really believes in his criteria regarding what is a workable bill <e> <s> he said that what is proposed is unjust and that people would not be able to pay <e> <s> however that argument did not stop the community charge going through both houses of parliament <e> <s> that is proving unworkable it is unfair and it is unjust <e> <s> what is proposed here is very simple <e> <s> the example of stray dogs has been given <e> <s> we must all have a licence for a television set <e> <s> of course there are some people who dodge the law but the majority keep it <e> <s> that is how this scheme would work <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> i feel i must speak up on behalf of the police <e> <s> last week i urged my driver to move into the bus lane outside the house because i did not want to be late for my train at liverpool street station <e> <s> he did as he was told <e> <s> however he was caught by a policeman when he turned the corner in parliament square <e> <s> i wonder whether i was unlucky or whether the noble earl is especially lucky in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept what my noble friend said <e> <s> i was in the studios of bsb on saturday <e> <s> we now have a situation where once again an entire staff is totally demoralised <e> <s> the people do not know whether their jobs will last one week or two weeks or one month or two months <e> <s> the government should realise that the bsb employees may well be their voters and i can assure them that they will need some of those votes <e> <s> i appeal to the <e>", "<cs> my lords as a sassenach and a townie i would like to have an answer from either the noble lord lord pearson or the noble lady on a matter which is of concern to me <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the hinds being slaughtered <e> <s> the word culled is just another euphemism <e> <s> once again it is the poor old female and i wonder why <e> <s> surely it is the stag which does the damage <e> <s> i do not follow that at all <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first congratulate the noble lord on his maiden speech <e> <s> i assume that swaffham prior is in norfolk <e> <s> my father was a norfolk man he came from swaffham where they do not do any troshing for nothing <e> <s> i am proud that i carry a name which i believe is a county name <e>", "<cs> my lords some female teachers are better <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said i greatly resented it that teachers were not professional <e> <s> teachers are professionals and always have been <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this is one of the many reasons why the british people are disenchanted with going into europe <e>", "<cs> my lords is it correct that the lord privy seal will remain on the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not have my name down to speak but i cannot fail to support all that the noble baroness lady macleod said <e> <s> like her i have always been a great supporter of the cause of my sex <e> <s> i have always supported sex discrimination laws and the equality for which we have fought <e> <s> like the noble baroness i have all too frequently met cases similar to those she described <e> <s> there has been a strange turn of events <e> <s> all too often now the man suffers because the woman appears to get the best of the argument <e> <s> sadly we all know cases within our own families <e> <s> as i said one day i do not need to watch dallas i could write the script from my own family <e>"]
