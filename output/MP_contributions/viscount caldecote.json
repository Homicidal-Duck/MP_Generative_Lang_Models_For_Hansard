["<cs> before i speak to this amendment i must declare a business interest in rhodesia <e> <s> i strongly oppose the amendment first because it ties the governments hands unnecessarily <e> <s> all noble lords will agree that the progress that has been made by my noble friend the foreign secretary has been outstanding <e> <s> that is a powerful argument for giving the government the maximum freedom of manoeuvre in these negotiations <e> <s> secondly i oppose the amendment because effectively it would give the patriotic front a veto and even the previous foreign secretary clearly stated that no one in these negotiations on rhodesia should be given an effective veto <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy is really rather unduly suspicious and seems to me to be making the issue unduly complex <e> <s> this is a very simple issue <e> <s> the fact is as all of us know who have anything to do with trade unions and industrial relations in industry that sometimes sometimes ballots and particularly secret ballots are very valuable <e> <s> it is also perfectly well known and the noble lord knows it as well as any of us that in the past when the trade unions have been pressed to have ballots and particularly secret ballots they have said we are very sorry we should like to hold ballots but we cannot afford it <e> <s> this clause gets over that difficulty <e> <s> it is a very simple point <e> <s> it enables trade unions when they wish to have the cost of their ballots and particularly secret ballots paid for <e> <s> it is therefore a good clause and should stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy will be aware that there are certain union membership agreements which are pre-entry and if a chap is not a member of the relevant union before he seeks a job he has not got a ghost of a chance of getting the job <e> <s> it is all wrong but that is the position <e> <s> why does he want to discriminate against a <e>", "<cs> the closed shop is clearly a very emotive issue <e> <s> i must make it clear from the start that i dislike it intensely <e> <s> i do not accept a word of what other noble lords have suggested that employers want the closed shop in order to have a quiet life <e> <s> i do not accept that it gives them a quiet life and if it did i would not want it because i think it offends against a fundamental principle <e> <s> i will not follow the noble viscount lord de lisle on the legal issues of the european commission on human rights <e> <s> i speak from a purely practical point of view the point of view of one who has worked in industry and has participated in taking decisions on these exceedingly difficult issues <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy says that his amendment would increase industrial peace <e> <s> supposing there are people in the shop and you have the per cent <e> <s> requirement then must be in favour <e> <s> if you take the noble lords figure and only vote and a two-thirds majority is required you get per cent <e> <s> so you have per cent <e> <s> of the people in the shop wanting a closed shop <e> <s> is that really a prescription for industrial peace <e> <s> we have found that if you agree to a union membership agreement only when per cent <e> <s> vote for it that does give industrial peace when one is forced into a uma situation <e>", "<cs> i have considerable sympathy with the amendment proposed by my noble friend lord orr-ewing <e> <s> i entirely agree that the practice he describes whereby contractors are in effect forced into signing contracts with <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is a very timely debate for we are at a very critical stage in moving towards a firmer base for the economy <e> <s> also i am afraid it has become clear from this debate that noble lords opposite still cherish the dangerous illusion that there is a softer option that we can easily adopt and get the same solution but get rid of all the pain and hardship <e> <s> if we are influenced by considerations of that kind of the hardship that is being suffered personally and by industry at the moment and we make that famous u-turn towards a softer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make two points on this bill <e> <s> first may i add my congratulations to the noble lord lord noel-buxton on his very authoritative and instructive maiden speech <e> <s> i agreed with the great majority of it but on one point which i shall mention in a moment i very much prefer to support the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood in her opposition to the abolition of the registration of business names <e> <s> this seems to me to be a retrograde step which will return to us the law of the jungle so far as business names are concerned <e> <s> there will be no possibility of search to see whether a new company name is appropriate or indeed whether somebody else is starting a new company the name of which is so close to an existing company as to mislead the people who deal with it <e> <s> it will make things much more difficult in every respect and i understand from what the noble lord lord trefgarne said in his opening speech that the abolition is mainly to save money <e>", "<cs> all right my lords partly to save money <e> <s> surely as the noble baroness made clear it could be made to pay <e> <s> i am told that the fees for searches are absurdly low <e> <s> i believe they are only a few pence and have not been altered for years <e> <s> if the fee was for every search made it could be made to pay and surely with the advent of micro-processors and data retrieval systems it really would not be very difficult <e> <s> i should have thought this problem would have been relatively easy to deal with as a result of modern techniques of that kind <e> <s> it could easily be made a paying proposition of value to industry as indeed it has been of value to industry for many years <e> <s> i very much hope that the government will look at the proposal to abolish the registration of business names completely and will see whether at least for a trial period of a few years it could not be made a paying proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may ask the noble earl a question is he really saying that investment is a bad thing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl criticised lord taylor of gryfe who was advocating it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jacques made a forceful and sincere speech <e> <s> i should like to put a slightly different point of view from his but not entirely for i very much agree on many aspects of his speech <e> <s> the noble lord lord jacques suggested that the shakeout in industry was not necessary <e> <s> i would disagree entirely on that point <e> <s> in my experience british manufacturing industry has been desperately overmanned for years <e> <s> if we are going to increase our productivity to make ourselves competitive as you will see later in my speech i believe that that shakeout has been absolutely essential <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned also a company of his acquaintance which he said was paying excessive interest <e>", "<cs> i would support most strongly the noble lords lord seebohm and lord boyd-carpenter and in particular the words used by lord boyd-carpenter when he said in the latter part of his speech that this would encourage people to set up this kind of company <e> <s> as the noble lord lord seebohm has already pointed out there has been a very great success rate with what has been called management buyouts and this amendment would provide for employee buy-outs on a larger scale <e> <s> i therefore support it strongly <e> <s> i agree that there are all the advantages which the noble lord lord seebohm put forward and i support them strongly too <e>", "<cs> my lords may i raise a point on the same subject <e> <s> is it not a fact that the membership of that working party was composed entirely of members from industry except one <e> <s> is the noble lord not aware also that most measures which are intended to prevent pollution are opposed by industry however desirable they may be <e> <s> it was not surprising therefore that the conclusions of the wmac came out as they did <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to apologise for not having been in the house earlier today particularly to hear the speech of the noble lord lord windlesham but i was involved in giving evidence to a select committee <e> <s> i must also disclose an interest for a company of which i am chairman has investments in a broker and in a managing agents <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords in this grave situation it is very important that we should keep cool but we should also i think be fiercely determined on two points <e> <s> first and most urgent as many noble lords have stressed to give our support with all the sincerity and all the wisdom that we can muster to the government in determining what now should be done from this position which we would have preferred not to reach <e> <s> secondly to analyse and to decide in due course but not now what lessons there are to be learnt for the future <e> <s> i should like to echo the point that the noble lord lord byers made that our intelligence services do seem to have been inadequate in this case and perhaps that comes from the cuts in those services that have been made by previous governments <e> <s> i hope that this government will look very carefully at that point <e>", "<cs> my lords like others i greatly enjoyed the vigorous speech of the noble lord lord marsh and i agreed with every word he said <e> <s> to be on the safe side i had better declare an interest in the bill because i am a vice-president of the engineering employers federation the principal organisation representing employers in the engineering industry and that organisation may be said to have some special interest in the outcome of the bill <e> <s> i will spend a few minutes commenting on the attitude of the federation to the bill but first i wish to make a few general comments <e> <s> the bill has been fairly described as modest but it is important particularly to those of us who work in industry <e> <s> the main purpose of the bill is to create a better balance of power my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter made that point clearly it is all about power between employer and employee in negotiations and to remove injustice to individuals resulting from the substantial power of trade unions largely created by previous legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble lord that the views that i expressed were views that i have discussed with my colleagues in the federation and i should not like the noble lord to leave any impression that there is dissension <e> <s> surely the point of the kind of discussions that have been going on over the past few months is to reach agreement to narrow differences <e> <s> surely it is wrong to complain that something that has been said early on is different from the view that is now expressed <e> <s> that is the point of discussion and negotiation <e>", "<cs> it is true as the noble lord lord houghton said that concern has been expressed about the periodical review of closed shops <e> <s> however the noble lord misrepresented the views expressed by the secretary of state when he made the conciliatory gesture that he would delay the implementation of the requirement of the review to have ballots <e> <s> the point surely is that where there has been a closed shop tradition in existence for a long time in a company or industry it will take time for the industry to readjust to the new provision which in my view is good <e> <s> if the provision were not included in the bill there would be no incentive for the industry or company concerned to take action and look around to see what they should <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of my noble friend lord de la warr who has moved the amendment <e> <s> the issue here is very different from that of having ballots on strike action and there is every reason to bring the practices of all trade unions up to the high standards of those that already adopt the practice of electing their officers <e> <s> there is no doubt that noble lords opposite will say <e>", "<cs> my lords in october of this year i had the good fortune to travel round the world and was able to talk to manufacturers and financial institutions in the united states of america australia singapore and rome <e> <s> i was tremendously impressed by the extent and depth of the world recession and by the downward spiral effect of one countrys difficulties increasing those of their trading partners and of the terrifying and increasing trends towards protectionism in various forms <e> <s> i had not appreciated the great severity of those factors in the world <e> <s> certainly we need to tackle them on a world co-operative basis <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put the noble lord right <e> <s> i support the government wholeheartedly <e> <s> the point i was making was that the government have been entirely and wholly successful in the policy that they followed and now it was time to proceed and to exploit the success of that policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we should all like to express our appreciation to the noble lord lord boothby for coming to this debate and giving us the benefit of his wide and long experience in spite of the fact that he is not feeling well <e> <s> we all wish him a speedy recovery <e> <s> i should like to make three points in relation to this useful white paper <e> <s> the first two are not raised explicitly in the paper and the third on public relations is <e>", "<cs> my lords on this valentines day it is a great pleasure and privilege to be sandwiched between four noble and distinguished baronesses on the speakers list <e> <s> before speaking in support of the bill i should like to declare a non-interest as a member of the british railways board and to make clear that the british railways board is neutral on the bill <e> <s> it has good relations with the passenger transport executives and wishes to be free to continue to co-operate with them as seems best <e> <s> i wanted to make that point in case anybody might feel that seeing me support the bill british rail was seeking to make life easy for itself by getting rid of these subsidies <e> <s> that is not so at all and in supporting the bill i emphasise that i am speaking entirely for myself and in no way reflecting the views of the british railways board <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a most timely debate on an important subject and i know how grateful we all are to the noble lord lord annan for introducing it <e> <s> i believe that the role of the universities has never been more significant in this era of rapid change in the pattern of work and leisure <e> <s> the basic purpose of universities i think we all agree is enrichment of life not only for those who attend universities but for the whole community <e> <s> universities must both lead and reflect changes in society <e> <s> in a free society like ours effective leadership involves respect and confidence <e>", "<cs> i see that he has taken copious notes and we look forward eagerly to his response <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great privilege to be the first speaker on these benches to follow the inspiring maiden speech of the noble earl lord stockton <e> <s> he was a very distinguished statesman when i first joined your lordships house over years ago so it is with real pleasure but with great humility that i offer him my warmest congratulations on his magnificent sparkling and forward-looking speech <e> <s> i hope that he will in the future often give us the benefit of his long experience and unrivalled wisdom <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord made our flesh creep by those comments from dr owen about what might happen if we go too far along the expansionist road <e> <s> of course it is a very difficult judgment of balances between opposing economic factors <e> <s> but the fact is that there is no shortage of tasks that need doing no shortage of people to do them and no shortage of money to finance them <e> <s> surely a government who have achieved so much in reducing inflation and in encouraging enterprise cannot shirk the challenge of bringing those three together the tasks the people and the money and so give hope to millions of young people who are now facing a very bleak future <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that if money were spent on the infrastructure instead of being given away i use the word loosely as relief for personal taxation that would not be inflationary <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend not agree that one of the factors putting pressure on the sterling exchange rate is the fact that pay increases in industry are running ahead of increases in productivity and that one of the greatest contributions that noble lords opposite could make would be to encourage their trade union friends not to ask for pay rises above increases in productivity so restoring greater confidence in industry and making it more competitive <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord lucas is very persuasive <e> <s> i understand the important point that he has made about the <e>", "<cs> my lords at the committee stage i voted against the amendment to clause although i felt there was some merit in the amendment that was put forward <e> <s> but that amendment went completely against the principles of this bill which were accepted on second reading <e> <s> since then the <e>", "<cs> my lords all private sector companies like to have continuity of arrangements <e> <s> they may find a little difficulty but that is not a matter of overriding importance when considering this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened very carefully to what was said by my noble friend lord young when he opened todays debate <e> <s> i wish that he was here now because i would have wished him well and every success with the great responsibilities he has recently taken on <e> <s> i was encouraged by much of what he said and by the actions which the government have taken and about which the chancellor spoke yesterday <e> <s> however because i believe that not enough is yet being done i shall be making some rather critical remarks <e> <s> before doing so i want to make clear that no one has greater admiration than i for what this government have achieved under the leadership of the prime minister in controlling inflation and the trade unions and in encouraging enterprise <e> <s> they have done a marvellous job and nothing can detract from that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord goes on too far in this vein could he perhaps say whether he believes in financial institutions which put forward large sums of risk capital to enable industry to expand and to create jobs <e> <s> or does he think they ought to be replaced too <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a privilege to hear my noble friend lord stockton once more deliver a magnificent wide-ranging review of past experience and present problems <e> <s> once again he showed penetrating insight and understanding of the real issues particularly in spotlighting the fundamental significance of manufacturing industry and its role as a creator of real wealth <e> <s> he raised the vital issue of how we may take advantage of the new technology to restore the prosperity of this country <e>", "<cs> there is an important sentence in the report of the select committee on the single european act which i should like to read to members of the committee and then make one or two comments <e> <s> the report says <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully share the serious concern expressed by the noble baroness lady cox but i am sorry to have to strike a discordant note from these benches <e> <s> we are all devoted to the cause of free speech most of all in our universities and polytechnics <e> <s> however it is the proposed method of achieving it which greatly worries me although i fully accept that the amendment stems from the highest motives and the best intentions <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there is any need to make the case further for manufacturing industry <e> <s> its importance to the creation of wealth is self-evident in adding value to raw materials <e> <s> but i think there is some misunderstanding about the role of manufacturing industry in job creation <e> <s> certainly the noble lord lord hatch of lusby seemed to be a bit muddled about that <e> <s> the fact is that with the increased productivity that modern technology provides as the occupational studies group report which was issued <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all most grateful to the noble lord lord hacking for bringing so clearly this important matter to the attention of the house <e> <s> it is a very complex and difficult problem but he set it out very well indeed if i may say so <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say whether the government are considering moving the first bank holiday in may to a monday later in the year perhaps to july or october to avoid the possible bunching which often takes place between that bank holiday and easter <e>", "<cs> i should hesitate to speak in the presence of so many experienced lawyers but there seems to be a commonsense point of view <e> <s> i should be happier to support the noble earls advice to reject this amendment if he could explain this point <e> <s> as i understand it if the extradition of a person is requested by another state he has the opportunity to make equal respresentations against being extradited <e> <s> if he is already in the country and has been acquitted of the crime for which he was in <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may express the hope that my noble friend will support his right honourable friend the chancellor in taking a robust line with the representations made by the underwriting institutions for the reasons that the noble lord has just given <e>", "<cs> this amendment clarified the present situation which is unsatisfactory because a lot of paid sports are taking place which are illegal <e> <s> i should like to come back to the point which the noble lord lord elton made earlier that we do not want to make sunday like any other day and have paid sport carried on throughout sunday <e> <s> if only we could find some way perhaps with a different amendment from the one that was defeated earlier to deal with the subject in that way i should feel much happier <e> <s> perhaps we can come back to this point at report stage because this is a very sweeping but tidying-up amendment which does not meet the points that many noble lords have already made in this debate <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> i wholly support the remarks of the noble viscount lord brentford and those of the noble lord lord elton <e> <s> the fact is that this illegal betting issue is a red herring as indeed were a number of the points made by the noble lord lord wyatt just now <e> <s> life is becoming more and more stressful these days <e> <s> more and more people are suffering from that and more and more people are having a shorter working week and are now able to do those things which previously they could do only at weekends <e>", "<cs> before the minister speaks again can he clarify a point <e> <s> as i understand it the point the noble lord is making is that we must have betting shops open on sundays if there is racing because if we do not there will be illegal betting <e> <s> i understand that is because you must bet through an authorised place of betting in order to collect taxes <e>", "<cs> would it not be better in these circumstances not to make any change and to leave the long title as it stands and to alter that on report <e>", "<cs> my lords two main themes run through this debate scientific research to expand knowledge and use of that knowledge by industry and government to increase national wealth and prosperity <e> <s> on the first three important questions arise <e> <s> are we doing enough research and devoting adequate resources to it are the resources that we devote to it used to the best advantage and are we training enough research workers to meet future needs <e>", "<cs> i am absolutely no expert of any kind in copyright law and i defer completely to the noble and learned lord lord hailsham <e> <s> however if he is saying in effect that this amendment is totally unnecessary and that those secondary publishers who provide abstract services as they have for the past years or so can continue to do so without any fear of prosecution or of being sued in some way for payment then of course i am absolutely satisfied and all is well but can we have that assurance <e>", "<cs> is not the agreement of the minister that tacit acceptance has been given a clear indication that nobody is worried nobody has been harmed <e> <s> the publishers of these articles who have had abstracts made by such organisations as the institution of electrical engineers over the years in large quantities have never complained <e> <s> they have given their tacit consent just as somebody gives tacit consent on a right of way <e> <s> if nobody objects people go on doing it and it becomes almost legal <e> <s> surely the fact that this tacit consent has been given indicates that this is a sensible amendment tabled in order to clarify the position <e>", "<cs> in certain circumstances the institute charges because this is an expensive operation and many experts are involved in carrying out the work <e> <s> it also provides an extremely useful service <e> <s> those of us who are interested in this matter are concerned about the fact that everything has gone along smoothly and happily and good service has been provided to research workers over the past years <e> <s> however if the amendment is not accepted the situation will change and it will become more difficult to carry out the abstracting work which was previously done and the scientific community will suffer <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord denning made the point that it would be useful and helpful to have the amendment included in the bill <e> <s> we do not want to press the matter to a division at this stage but will the minister undertake to look at the point that we have made so as not to interfere with the valuable service which has been of great use to the scientific community <e>", "<cs> with that assurance and on the understanding that we may wish to return to the matter at a later stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in a finely balanced issue of this kind i think it is very important that all the facts should be clearly before us <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins said that the whole industry was in favour of the amendment <e> <s> the tape manufacturers industry is not in favour of it for obvious reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to ask before the noble lord sits down whether he does not think he is being a little unkind perhaps a little unfair to a group of local honest people who are merely doing their best for what they regard as the good of their locality <e> <s> he poured a lot of cold water on the local poll which was conducted i understand according to the law and then accused the local people who had conducted it of deception <e> <s> i think that is really going rather too far in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a problem here <e> <s> abstracts are used by scientists and engineers working for employers to find out what has been done in the field in which they are working so as not to have to repeat the work in order to know where they can start <e> <s> it may not be private study in that sense but for use in their work <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> we thought that we were helping him by simplifying the problem as he was unable to accept the amendments that were moved at an earlier stage <e> <s> with the ministers assurance than an amendment will be moved in another place i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be extremely grateful to the noble lord lord shackleton for so ably and comprehensively introducing the report of his committee on united kingdom space policy <e> <s> i believe that it is a most valuable report indicating how we may make the best use of our opportunities in space <e> <s> i shall not go through all the recommendations with which broadly i agree <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that a most important factor in improving the balance between imports and exports is for manufacturing companies to invest more in new product development <e> <s> will her majestys government do everything possible to stimulate that <e>", "<cs> my lords we are nearing the end of a long and valuable debate <e> <s> i have listened to most of the wide-ranging speeches and i shall try not to be repetitive particularly as i agreed with so much of what the noble lord lord ezra and my noble friend lord aldington said and they said much better than i could many of the things i intended to say <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make the point to the noble baroness that the difficulties of improving manufacturing industry are much longer term and much more difficult than those for service industries <e> <s> therefore they require more effort to get them right than do service industries whose growth follows naturally upon the growth of manufacturing industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i was disappointed with the unconstructive speeches of noble lords from the front benches of the parties opposite in this very difficult situation <e> <s> they seem to add nothing positive to the difficulties that we face <e> <s> i fully support her majestys government in the actions they have taken and in the directive that the home secretary has given on their behalf <e> <s> of course it is not a complete solution i wish it were as easy as that <e> <s> it is a contribution in the right direction but it is no panacea <e> <s> it seems that we must regard ourselves virtually in a state of war with those who are prepared to kill innocent people in pursuance of their objectives however strongly their views are held <e> <s> in such circumstances surely it is entirely reasonable to give up to some small extent the freedom that we regard as fundamental to our way of life in normal circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords it is right that the house should be debating this report but it is sad that we are doing so in the shadow of another tragic major accident to travellers involving the loss of life and terrible injuries <e> <s> i should like to repeat what other noble lords have said and say how grateful we are to mr fennell for such an excellent detailed report and carefully considered conclusion <e> <s> we should also congratulate her majestys government on the rapidity with which they commissioned the report and the speed with which it has been published <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his support for the principle of this amendment in that he says that it is important that this information should be disclosed <e> <s> i simply cannot understand why if it is so important that there is an objection to making it statutory <e> <s> the minister did not mention that at all <e> <s> perhaps he could help us by saying what is the objection to making it statutory <e>", "<cs> it is rather a red herring to say that if you have one ssap made statutory you have to have them all made statutory <e> <s> we are not asking for that <e> <s> we are asking for the principle of one ssap to be made statutory <e>", "<cs> with regard to small companies if it would help the minister i am perfectly happy to agree that my amendment should apply only to plcs <e> <s> there is no problem about that <e> <s> that is what we should like the government to consider and to bring in as an amendment at report stage either on the lines of this amendment or to give delegated power to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> to avoid all possibilities of misunderstanding is the minister saying that the secretary of state now has power under the companies act as it will be amended by this bill to bring in by delegated legislation amendments to what needs to be disclosed in company reports and in particular that he could bring in delegated legislation to meet the point in this amendment <e>", "<cs> on that understanding i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house whether the design and advisory service will continue to be available to industry <e> <s> further will the grant-in-aid to the design council continue at its present level in real terms in the next financial year <e>", "<cs> at the end of the debate which we had upon the amendment in which i proposed to include rd expenditure in company accounts my noble friend lord strathclyde gave an assurance that clause c would enable the secretary of state to make an order requiring research and development expenditure to be included in company accounts <e> <s> can he confirm that the document of any class includes company accounts <e> <s> further can he also confirm that what he said yesterday is still the case after he has given the matter further consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indeed grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for introducing this important debate <e> <s> he did so with his usual amiable eloquence but i thought that his logic contained some things which i believe in his profession are called <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> the fact is my lords that it cannot be enforced and therefore he argues on a false premise <e>", "<cs> my lords we agree to differ on the subject but all in all my noble friend reminded me of the apocryphal civil servant who finished his speech to his minister after making a case by saying and those minister are the opinions on which i base my facts <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down will he say whether he would wish to apply the principle that everyone must have complete freedom of choice against the nanny state to planning controls for instance so that everyone would be free to choose where and how they built their house <e>", "<cs> i should like most strongly to support what my noble friend lord carr has said <e> <s> i believe that the principles of this amendment are very important <e> <s> as regards subsection it would seem <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister one question <e> <s> he rightly referred to the importance of the efficient management of companies <e> <s> would he not agree that the uncertainty resulting from a substantial minority holding of around per cent <e> <s> of a company over a long period is extremely detrimental to the efficient management of that company because it creates uncertainty in the minds of management and all employees and that something needs to be done to reduce the number of occasions when that happens <e>", "<cs> i fully support what my noble friend said and i take up one point that the noble lord lord williams made <e> <s> when i was the chairman of companies in the past i remember several times a secretary coming to me and saying chairman i do not think you can do that <e> <s> you cannot do this or that <e> <s> there is no problem for the secretary to say that and if the chairman is sensible he will take wise advice <e> <s> that is the way it should be done as my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> perhaps this is a case where the details should be left to the very eminent legal members of your lordships house <e> <s> but may i ask the minister what i might call a common sense question <e> <s> is it not a fact that if the bill remains as it is drafted it gives a greater incentive to financial institutions to inquire in cases where they might be <e>", "<cs> i have considerable sympathy with the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> as my noble friend the secretary of state will know i attach great importance to the strengthening of our manufacturing base <e> <s> any merger which weakens the manufacturing base is i believe <e>", "<cs> i never suggested for one moment that there was any question of protecting inefficient management from bids <e> <s> i suggested only that the public interest is better served if a merger increases the strength of our manufacturing base rather than decreases it <e> <s> there are very good criteria for considering that <e> <s> my noble friend can ask the companies for instance whether their share of the market will be increased or decreased by the merger <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i should like to ask a question <e> <s> she referred to the possibility of there being no objection to waste being imported into this country for treatment <e> <s> is there not a danger of the waste being imported allegedly for that purpose but really in order to get round any regulations prohibiting imported waste thereby adding to the waste already in this country <e> <s> that issue was referred to at the meeting of the science and technology committee to which the noble baroness referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we all ought to be extremely grateful to my noble friend the duke of norfolk for having initiated this debate through his introduction of the bill <e> <s> i wholly disagree with the noble lord lord houghton and i was sorry that he made criticisms of my noble friend and questioned his motives in introducing the bill <e> <s> one of the great advantages of this debate is that it has shown almost total unanimity in the views of your lordships that early legislation is very important <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that his answer indicates that although the existing law needs clarification it is effective in maintaining the special nature of sunday as a day of rest and refreshment for as many people as possible and that any future legislation should maintain that principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i am almost more worried now than i was at the start of this discussion <e> <s> i wonder whether certain noble lords have even read ssap <e> <s> there is no intention that the inclusion of this amendment in the bill should supersede ssap it would merely give it strength <e> <s> ssap would still be available and auditors would have to take note of it <e> <s> if all the details were not adhered to as my noble friend the secretary of state said the auditors would qualify the accounts <e> <s> but this amendment would give added statutory power to ensure that that very important information is included in the accounts <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true but my noble friend the secretary of state would also agree that some large companies have considerable influence over their auditors <e> <s> that is in no way to say that auditors do not do their job but it is a matter of judgment as to what makes a true and fair view of the accounts and in certain cases <e>", "<cs> my lords that is probably true <e> <s> i am not an expert on the subject although i spent some time on the inflation accounting committee <e> <s> we were disappointed about the lack of reaction to our report <e> <s> that is perhaps another matter but it indicates that some companies particularly large companies sometimes say to their auditors in exactly the way i was suggesting we dont agree with you <e> <s> we think weve made a perfectly good statement and presented our accounts in a true and fair way <e> <s> discussion continues and both the auditors and the company give a little <e> <s> however if the requirement were made statutory as it has been in the united states of america where it has been entirely satisfactory and has had a highly beneficial result in that when research and development expenditure is increased the tendency is for the share price to go up even though the profits do down <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord williams of elvel gave an example from the inflation accounting ssap to show that that was not carried through by a considerable number of companies <e> <s> that is pefectly true <e> <s> if that can happen in that case why should it not happen in this case <e> <s> if it is bad here why is it not bad in the united states where it has been very satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord suggesting that if the amendment were passed ssap would in some way be weakened <e> <s> i do not believe that that is the case <e> <s> ssap has been agreed as a standard accounting procedure and it would go ahead just as it does now whether or not the amendment is accepted <e> <s> however if the amendment is passed it gives it much greater strength and statutory support <e>", "<cs> my lords ssap mentions all the points to which the noble lord lord boardman refers <e> <s> i do not know whether he has read ssap but it is clear how the disclosure will be made in the accounts <e> <s> the amendment would simply give ssap statutory backing <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very good news indeed that such a big investment will be made by toyota <e> <s> we all congratulate my noble friend on the matter especially in regard to the large effect it will have on job creation <e> <s> however perhaps i may ask my noble friend the secretary of state two questions <e> <s> first is he confident that such jobs will not in time lead to a reduction in employment in other parts of the british motor car industry <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly should be very grateful to the noble lord lord ezra for introducing this debate on a very important and topical issue <e> <s> it is a serious situation and i shall make some rather critical comments <e> <s> so perhaps may say right at the beginning that whatever i say in no way reduces my admiration for the achievements of her majestys government over the past years <e> <s> in particular at home they have rekindled the spirit of enterprise controlled trade union power and helped industry to improve productivity <e> <s> until recently we could have added to that list the successful control of inflation but clearly a few problems have occurred recently in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point can he just confirm that he believes and is saying that greater investment by industry in new product development is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i have considerable sympathy for the objectives of this amendment <e> <s> my understanding of it is that there are two aspects <e> <s> the first is continuity of protection on which the noble lord has just spoken <e> <s> it is an obvious point that i hope the government will take on board because there is no point in protecting the use of land and water areas which now belong to the water undertakings and abandoning that protection if and when the land is sold <e>", "<cs> i was very glad to hear what the noble lord said <e> <s> the wording of subsection subject to subsection implies that subsection is more important than subsection <e> <s> no doubt that point can be dealt with in subsequent amendments <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble earl one short question <e> <s> he referred to the continuing protection of conservation and amenity values <e> <s> does amenity include recreation <e>", "<cs> my noble friend the minister has put great emphasis on the importance of the code of practice <e> <s> will he not take this away and consider it <e> <s> surely it is much better to have the provision as stated in amendment no <e> <s> b rather than leave it to the general powers of the secretary of state under clause <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will think again <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord greenway on this amendment <e> <s> the government are in danger of appearing schizophrenic in respect of the code of practice <e> <s> on the one hand they say that it is very important indeed while on the other hand in response to every proposal to strengthen the code of practice and its implementation they say that it is not very important and it is better to save time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for that very full explanation <e> <s> perhaps i may raise two points <e> <s> i am not clear why the arrangements in scotland for enhancement and protection of the environment should be different from those in england <e> <s> alternatively is he saying there are as adequate powers for the enhancement and protection of the environment as there are in england <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord for his very full explanation <e> <s> he gave a little hope by saying that he did not think that this was the right time to make these changes without further consultation with those involved <e> <s> that gives a little hope that he might be prepared to carry out such consultation <e> <s> he has put forward many fairly complex points with aid and support from his office which are difficult for amateurs like myself to deal with at a time like this <e> <s> i should like to leave it that we shall consult together perhaps after this debate and if necessary bring forward a proposal at third reading to deal with this very important point on the basis that it is just as important in scotland as in england to have provisions to protect and enhance the environment <e> <s> that is the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> i should like to consult the noble lord later to see whether we can together agree something to achieve that <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not support this reasoned amendment broadly for the reasons that my noble friend lord nugent has already stated <e> <s> however for many of us who support the broad thrust of government policy this is a disappointing bill <e> <s> it is lacking in wisdom despite the many improvements that have been made in your lordships house and which no doubt will be made elsewhere <e> <s> we have spent many hours on the bill and many more hours will be spent on it <e> <s> much effort has been spent on what i believe to be unnecessary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great admiration to the most sincere and moving speech by the most reverend primate <e> <s> i hope that nothing i shall say will cause him any distress because i hold him in very high regard <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the situation which prevailed before the establishment of the engineering industry training board <e> <s> enterprising companies spent a great deal of money on training people only to have the skilled staff they had trained poached by other companies which had spent no money on training <e> <s> is he satisfied that the new arrangements for transferring the engineering industry training board to industry will provide a satisfactory supply of trained manpower in the absence of any external monitoring arrangement as suggested in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords we all welcome my noble friends statement <e> <s> it provides further evidence of the confidence of japanese industry in the uk as a place in which to invest and in our workforce <e> <s> however is he aware that the motor car component manufacturing companies are concerned that it will lead to a position where motor components are made under licence or to the designs of foreign companies <e> <s> therefore our components manufacturers will degenerate into subcontractors making to other peoples designs <e> <s> is he satisfied about the future of our motor components manufacturers in that respect <e> <s> can he also say why he believes that it is possible for a great japanese motor car manufacturer to invest such large sums of money in this country in order to make a large number of motor cars while it does not appear possible for our own companies to make such large investments for the same purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not much more important to stimulate the growth of uk manufacturing industry than it is to adopt irrelevant social charters from europe <e>", "<cs> my lords we have spent a considerable amount of time discussing the constitutional issues on this point <e> <s> i believe that there are other issues of equal or perhaps greater importance <e> <s> i do not believe that we should insist on our amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to achieving regular attendance at schools in order for children to take advantage of the quality of education is my noble friend satisfied that there is an adequate number of school attendance officers to ensure regular attendance <e>", "<cs> my lords the gracious speech contains many valuable proposals for legislation which are much concerned with the quality of life <e> <s> i welcome them all <e> <s> but as my noble friend lord caithness emphasised in his opening speech that concentration on the quality of life has to be paid for and can only be paid for by the resources generated by wealth creation the principal source of which is manufacturing industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord walton has given a wonderful explanation of the medical facts behind the issues in this debate and i am sure we are extremely grateful to him <e> <s> it emphasises once again the great benefits we enjoy in your lordships house through having members with such wide experience of all the matters we discuss <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that it is the intention of her majestys government to move steadily towards the oecd target of per cent <e> <s> of gnp for overseas aid <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> if the bill is left as it is surely all the research into making more efficient the methods of ivf would come under the heading <e> <s> it is to assist women to carry children <e> <s> surely my noble friend lord ashbourne is right in saying that the provision would include a large measure of work which we normally regard as research <e> <s> my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has made clear that such work is not intended to be covered by the subsection <e>", "<cs> the extraordinary aspect of the debate is that we all profess our keenness to help the stability of family life and marriages <e> <s> yet every time we debate an amendment that is intended to do so we shy away from it on the grounds that it is interference with individual liberty <e> <s> that is a totally unconvincing argument as my noble friend lord lauderdale has clearly put before us <e>", "<cs> i hesitate very much before crossing swords with the noble lord lord walton who is a great expert in this field <e> <s> however the mixing of human and animal gametes is repugnant to us all in principle <e> <s> the argument put forward is simply that the ends justify the means <e> <s> to my mind that is a bad argument <e> <s> it may be only a micro-step on a slippery slope <e> <s> but that slope is very steep <e> <s> i do not think that it is a slope <e> <s> we are on the edge of a precipice into a very frightening abyss <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend the minister for her reply <e> <s> the fact that the tests have been carried out for a long time is neither here nor there <e> <s> many people were not aware that they were being carried out <e> <s> i recognise that some inconvenience would be caused if the amendment were carried <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my congratulations to my noble friend lord de la warr on his excellent speech <e> <s> we are all grateful to my noble friend lord boardman for introducing this debate on an important subject on which many words of wisdom have already been expressed <e> <s> i fully agree with him on the benefits of the market economy free but sensibly regulated <e> <s> i fully agree too that great progress has been made under the present government over the past years in rekindling the spirit of enterprise and risk-taking as my noble friend lord joseph said <e> <s> the removal of restrictive trade practices of all kinds the privatisation of manufacturing and some other companies and much more all lead to a more productive and competitive industry which is of vital importance <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i was speaking to a doctor a gynaecologist a few days ago who is invited on occasions to do exactly what my noble friend the duke of norfolk suggested might sometimes happen <e> <s> that is determining the sex of the child to be born <e> <s> surely that is not something which we would feel was a good thing <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while accepting that there is obviously a need for change in these organisations is my noble friend aware of the importance of continuity in training and of the damage that has been done over the past years by so many changes in training schemes <e> <s> we have had the community programme the yts jts et and so many schemes <e> <s> it is very difficult for agencies in this field to keep abreast of them and to work effectively and efficiently <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether he will do everything possible to ensure that there is now a period of stability for training organisations so as to help with the efficient training which is so very important to our industry <e>", "<cs> i did not quite catch what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said <e> <s> was it that he would accept this amendment or that an amendment would be brought forward at report stage <e>", "<cs> for the second time tonight i should like to thank my noble and learned friend sincerely for his acceptance of the amendments i put forward <e> <s> in view of his undertaking i am very happy to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i ask my noble friend what action is open to members of the public if they sincerely believe that the dpp is not prosecuting when he should be <e> <s> does that come within the duties of the ombudsman or is there some other recourse open to them <e>", "<cs> i support the noble earl lord halsbury on the amendment for these reasons first we are all well aware of the difficulty of changing the law on this complex subject <e> <s> secondly one of the most repugnant activities that we observe is when at one end of a hospital doctors and nurses are working hard to save the lives of premature babies while at the other end fetuses of the same gestation <e>", "<cs> my lords i voted for research on th february but i should like to raise one question which seems to me to be an important outstanding issue <e> <s> i have great respect and admiration for the sincerity of the noble lords lord walton of detchant and lord ennals and the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> however this is a deep and difficult issue as are so many in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords that is correct but the bill does not appear to tackle the problem of how to regulate the supply of embryos to be created solely for research <e> <s> would it not perhaps be a good way of proceeding to ask my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor whether he will give further consideration as to how that matter might be dealt with and as to how if at all it is proposed that the regulation of the supply of embryos purely for research should be dealt with <e> <s> is it to be left to the licensing authority or is parliament to play a part in legislating to deal with that problem <e> <s> it appears an urgent issue <e> <s> at the extreme it would be repugnant to have any kind of industry or business arising from the supply of embryos <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend the minister said i moved an amendment in committee to subsection of clause at line of page to require the authority to record information <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how much i welcome this amendment which is relevant to earlier discussion at report stage <e> <s> it is most important to ensure that there is no trade in embryos gametes and the like <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to those who have supported this amendment <e> <s> my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor and my noble friend lady hooper have given careful consideration to the points that i have raised <e> <s> i normally admire the speeches of the noble lord lord houghton both as regards their logic and their sincerity <e> <s> however today i was only able to admire his sincerity <e> <s> as other noble lords have said if we do not have inspectors all the provisions for enforcement in this bill are null and void <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the point of view put forward by my noble friend lord perth <e> <s> this is a very important issue and parliament should be kept informed <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord walton will withdraw his amendment provided the government will accept the amendment of the noble earl lord perth <e>", "<cs> my lords at an earlier stage of this bill i moved amendments relating to inspection as my noble friend lady hooper said <e> <s> at report stage my noble friend undertook to bring forward an amendment at third reading to give effect to the substance of my amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kennet raised many issues with which we have been grappling over the past few weeks <e> <s> we have wrestled with our consciences and with very difficult medical and legal issues <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> i believe that we have greatly improved this bill during its passage through this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the debate which i agree with my noble friend has been a very interesting one <e> <s> i am most grateful for the warm welcome which all speakers gave to the report <e> <s> the noble lord lord hatch was an exception but as the noble lord lord shackleton said his strictures were almost entirely irrelevant to the subject of the report <e> <s> i should particularly like to thank my noble friend lord trefgarne for the welcome that he gave to the report and his constructive and encouraging comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i greatly welcome the benefits that stem from this inward investment which has been stimulated by the policies of her majestys government <e> <s> however does my noble friend agree that most of the research and development work upon which these activities are based has been carried out overseas <e> <s> does he further agree that it is important to do everything possible to stimulate and encourage british companies to invest more in new competitive products <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that although we are all in favour i believe that there has been wide agreement on this matter of removing the absurd anomalies to which my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter referred west germany the netherlands and italy have prohibitions similar to those provided for by the shops act on shops opening on sundays and that there are effective ways of enforcing the laws in those countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully respect the views of all those who support the bill in particular those who have suffered either indirectly or directly through the ghastly crimes that were certainly committed <e> <s> as the noble and gallant lord lord carver indicated we must surely ask ourselves what is the purpose the objective of prosecuting <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected <e> <s> every day we are told that money is not available for worthy causes <e> <s> i can quote four worthy charities which work to help disadvantaged young people to prevent them becoming criminals in the future <e> <s> if million pounds a year was given to each of those charities for three or five years it would make an enormous difference and would give tremendous value to thousands of young people far into the future <e> <s> can we justify spending million a year on investigating events which took place years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to all the noble lords who have made such excellent maiden speeches in the debate tonight <e> <s> in particular i should like to congratulate my noble kinsman lord glasgow who made such an excellent and well-informed speech <e> <s> i had the privilege to sit in your lordships house with both his grandfather and his father and it is good to see the family tradition carried on <e> <s> we hope that the noble lord will speak many times in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i myself belong to a trade union <e> <s> i belong to a trade union through my long-standing membership of the united kingdom association of professional engineers <e> <s> it is now a responsible and active section of the electrical electronic telecommunication and plumbing union to which the noble lord lord chappell has given long distinguished and constructive service <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us what this has to do with industrial relations <e>", "<cs> oh <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting debate and i shall not detain the house for more than a few moments <e> <s> i should like to add my congratulations to those already expressed to the noble lord lord wade for his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i particularly liked his emphasis on the principle unite for success and his belief that the governments legislation has helped in that direction <e> <s> i think that it was my noble friend lord oxfuird who mentioned that this was all a question of balance <e> <s> i agree with that view <e> <s> i also agree with the cbis view that we have just about got the right balance or that we will have done so by the time the present employment bill is enacted <e> <s> i also support my noble friends emphasis on dignity which i think is enormously important in industrial relations <e>", "<cs> my lords although i agree that the law needs to be reformed is my noble friend aware that a special meeting of about local authority senior officers and councillors who were attending the annual conference of the institute of trading standards administration on th june condemned the small group of large retailers and very highly-paid lobby groups for their attitude to this issue <e> <s> is he further aware that since november when the european court upheld our sunday laws over enforcement prosecutions have been instituted all over the country culminating recently in the torfaen prosecution of bq <e> <s> will he take that into account <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that recent improvements in our balance of trade in manufactured products indicates that the governments policy is working and that it is a very important factor in controlling inflation <e>", "<cs> this is a most extraordinary amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy talked a lot about chartered accountants and other people of whom i do not have much knowledge <e> <s> he did not mention chartered engineers <e> <s> a chartered engineer has a high qualification <e> <s> it is up to the employer if he wants to to specify as he should do in certain circumstances that a job is open only to a chartered engineer because he wishes to be sure that the person whom he is appointing to that job has certain qualifications which are denoted by the qualification of chartered engineer <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord dean of beswick seemed to be confused in regard to a point that i made <e> <s> in regard to a shipping accident my argument was that the designer of the modification used initials after his name which gave the impression that he was qualified to design the modifications <e> <s> in fact he was not qualified to do so and the ship therefore capsized <e> <s> i drew attention to the importance in relation to what was said by the noble lord lord mccarthy of describing people correctly according to their qualifications <e> <s> i was making no other point <e>", "<cs> we have heard two most sincere speeches from different points

opposition just as much as it did the speech of my noble friend lord caithness who described the governments policy so well and succinctly <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble earl lord halsbury that due to a misunderstanding i was not in my place when he moved the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend on the front bench confirm that it is government policy to pay teachers of mathematics and science more highly than other teachers because of the great demand for their services in industry and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to my noble and
