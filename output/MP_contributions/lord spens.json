["<cs> my lords i want to follow my noble friend lord newall in speaking about the problems of cyprus <e> <s> i too feel that we have let down the inhabitants of that island very badly in the past and there is no reference to cyprus in the gracious speech <e> <s> i hope that that indicates something good rather than bad because although in the last two gracious speeches introduced by the previous government specific reference was made to the island nothing was done about it <e> <s> i ask only that her majestys government will confirm that they still accept a special responsibility as a guarantor under the treaty not only of the independence of cyprus but also of the rights of both communities as set out in the constitution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not saying that they should not be occupied but just that they should not compete in the market for paid jobs <e> <s> this is not so heretical a solution as might be supposed because the office revolution is going to affect women far more than men <e> <s> another concept worth consideration is the idea of one family wage earner the others in the family finding occupation other than in the labour market <e> <s> then of course earlier retirement may be a solution especially for those of us who are out of date and work-sharing <e> <s> whatever solution is selected is bound to cause an upheaval in the social life of our country <e> <s> there will be much more leisure time which itself requires careful thought and organisation <e> <s> the noble lord lord miles rather made his speech on that point yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a fascinating and to me a very stimulating debate even if we have strayed a little from the scenario which i thought i had set <e> <s> however i remain very optimistic <e> <s> i think that a study of <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that there is a polytechnic in this country which has a computer terminal which is so little used that the majority of the teachers do not know where it is <e> <s> i am told that only two of the teachers use it and that only very occasionally <e> <s> and that polytechnic is supposed to teach business management studies <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for introducing this debate but i want to bring your lordships down from the sublime general arguments we have been listening to to a very few small particular ones <e> <s> the motion welcomes the changes which the government have initiated to achieve the reversal of our present economic decline <e> <s> so far as those changes go i welcome them but they have not gone very far as yet in particular in relation to small businesses and it is about small businesses that i want to speak today <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome these orders and i also support the speeches made by the noble lord lord rochester and the noble baroness lady seear because i am speaking on behalf of small businesses <e> <s> just over a year ago i wrote a letter to <e>", "<cs> my lords i quoted some statistics from the national federation of the self-employed <e> <s> those statistics cover members and i think that that is a little larger than either of the statistics the noble lord has quoted <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord newall for asking this question <e> <s> i accompanied him to turkish cyprus in february and march and we spent the best part of a week there together <e> <s> we saw as much as we could i think of the whole of the turkish-cypriot economy <e> <s> i did not go into the greek sector because to do that at the moment one has to fly into the greek sector first and then come across to the turkish sector in order to comply with the rules and regulations of the government of cyprus <e> <s> i was not prepared to do that so i flew into ercan the airport on the turkish side and therefore i had to stay on the turkish side <e>", "<cs> my lords one cannot put the clock back but unfortunately the people in cyprus on both sides have fairly long memories <e> <s> they are still i believe living very much in the past <e> <s> somehow i think we must bring them forward into the present <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene very briefly only because i want to qualify myself to speak in committee <e> <s> i believe fervently in the freedom of the press and this bill must be scrutinised in minute detail in committee before we allow it to go forward <e> <s> i supported the noble lord lord goodman when he implied so i think that it is the specific restrictions on freedom of speech which must be scrutinised <e> <s> having said that i give my support to the second reading of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in congratulating our maiden speakers today and in particular to support the noble lord lord irving of dartford both in his plea for better roads to the south-east and also in what he said about the technological revolution brought about by micro-electronics which is now upon us <e> <s> in a debate in june i predicted that unemployment would rise to some million by and i believe that the noble lord would have supported me in that prediction unless something very drastic is done very quickly <e> <s> i said then i did not believe that ordinary market forces would solve this problem however freed from government controls they may have become <e> <s> this needs a speedy but thorough review of the alternatives that are available <e> <s> your lordships may remember that i rather stuck my neck out and suggested that a partial and temporary solution might be to persuade married women not to take paid employment <e> <s> such persuasion of course would have to be financial <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that at the moment we suffer from two employment protection acts that of and the consolidation act of which did not appear to consolidate very much <e> <s> does the minister not agree that it would be far better if a further consolidation act were introduced which was very much slimmer <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the subject of the debate so ably introduced by the noble baroness lady sharples and so well supported by the two previous speakers i shall try to keep myself within the time limit laid down by the noble baroness <e> <s> therefore i want to confine myself to making only one point <e> <s> that point t made in fact in a debate on th november <e> <s> it was a long debate running to a fairly late hour and i was not able to stay until the end of it so that the noble lord the minister who is not the minister down to reply to us this afternoon was able to avoid giving me an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord inform us whether the government are ready to take an initiative now in trying to get the two parties to come together at the conference table <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name down to speak this morning and expected to find myself at the bottom of the list of speakers which would have suited me because i have a point to raise with the minister which has nothing to do with this present debate but it fits in with the title of the debate <e> <s> as i have been elevated a little i feel that i must make one general comment on this debate before going on to my own particular point <e> <s> i am no expert on airports policy <e> <s> what i am going to say rather complements what the last two speakers the noble lords lord parry and lord abinger have been talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the united states government under president kennedy as an emergency measure very nearly doubled the import duty on woven wilton carpets and that emergency import duty remained for very nearly years <e> <s> could not the commission be thinking of something in those terms <e> <s> as far as i know no retaliatory action was taken by anyone else because the united states carpet industry was not in those days exporting many carpets <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i could spend another minutes in summing up but if i were to do that i fear this debate would end on a note of discord <e> <s> there is one point i want to clarify before beginning my summing up and that is the apparently generous offer of president kyprianou over pensions <e> <s> that must be put into perspective and the perspective is this <e> <s> the greek cypriot government have paid no pensions to turkish cypriots since although they took over the national insurance and social security fund covering all of cyprus in <e> <s> moreover they are continuing to be sent the national insurance contributions from turkish cypriots who are working in the british sovereign bases <e> <s> those contributions are now going direct to the government of cyprus because the government of cyprus is the only government which is recognised by her majestys government <e> <s> therefore although president kyprianous offer obviously is a good start it is nothing like the generous offer that it appeared to be <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in what he has just said <e> <s> i think this clause is not on as it stands <e> <s> the government have been telling us that we must leave as much flexibility as possible to local authorities and here we have a very detailed procedure laid down which is not going to allow the local authorities any space to manoeuvre at all <e> <s> i should like to see the first three subsections of the clause left in and the remainder of the clause and the schedule cancelled <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness for that information <e> <s> i understand why she cannot relax this clause and i hope that the local authorities will be able to continue to make the arrangements for the choir schools <e> <s> i think there are about of them involved with a total of about pupils of whom probably only about would be in need of assistance <e> <s> so it is a fairly small operation and i hope they will be able to carry on as they have in the past <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that somewhat equivocal reply and i think i know what he means <e> <s> may i ask him whether he can confirm that any exemption that exists would be extended to commercially licensed vehicles as well as to privately licensed vehicles and that there would be no limitation on the distance driven <e>", "<cs> my lords if my remarks appear to be somewhat disjointed to start off with i hope to pull the threads together to make my points <e> <s> before the noble baroness leaves the chamber may i say that i hope she does not think that i am a complacent person because i like this budget <e> <s> i think it is very exciting and i cannot quite understand how she can call it short-sighted because there is not much joy in it today but i think there is a lot of hope and encouragement for tomorrow <e> <s> in particular like the noble lord lord nugent of guildford i like the parts devoted to small businesses and the special enterprise zones <e> <s> small businesses are now becoming very popular <e> <s> they even merit a heading in <e>", "<cs> my lords i had my attention drawn by the noble lord who has just sat down to paragraph of article of the order and it quite horrifies me <e> <s> one has the idea that some of these new suggestions are perhaps tried out first in northern ireland before possibly being brought across to this country <e> <s> although as far as i know i have never been in the situation which paragraph might put me there are i should say quite a number of my friends who possibly have been and who are possibly likely to be in the future <e> <s> i am thinking of those who perhaps go to a meet of hounds at the local inn and then try to mount their horses a little later than they should have done <e> <s> to find that they might be guilty of an offence and may not only be fined up to but possibly imprisoned for two months is rather shattering <e> <s> moreover under paragraph one sees that a constable might arrest them without any warrant if he considered that there was reasonable cause to suspect that such a person was in the act of committing such an offence <e> <s> as i have said it quite horrifies me <e>", "<cs> if i may speak for a moment i have no experience of local government but i have had a little experience of the law albeit a long time ago <e> <s> i should like to draw the attention of the minister to the very page page that he quoted schedule <e> <s> in paragraph on that page there appears in <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not keep your lordships very long but i am one of those recently mentioned by the noble viscount who has just sat down who criticised this bill for not being strong enough <e> <s> of course i shall support it in its passage through the house but like my noble friend lord harris of high cross i will seek to amend it in certain clauses or to persuade the government to consider some amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house what has happened to a number of personal possessions belonging to turkish cypriots who had been formerly employed in the british bases and who had to go to the north <e> <s> they have not been able to recover those possessions which include motor cars tractors sporting weapons and other items of that kind <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> i consider that it answers some of the points made by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby earlier this afternoon when he spoke about ballots being necessary only when the important matters appear to be contentious <e> <s> in this case we consider that the members of a union should be given the opportunity of testing the strength of feeling inside the union for a decision which has already been taken by their leadership to call a strike or later after the strike has started to see whether the feeling of the member <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to add my congratulations to those already <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> in fact when it was first drafted i should have liked to take it very much further back to because it was in the years and that the majority of the new closed shops were formed <e> <s> they were formed very quickly and not necessarily with the willing acceptance of all members <e> <s> they were mostly negotiated between trade union leaders and management and members were then told that they had to join <e> <s> however i see the point in taking it back only to the date of the general election because that keeps it within the conservative partys manifesto <e> <s> for that reason i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to say a few words about this amendment <e> <s> i want to draw the ministers attention to what happened some years ago in the restrictive practices court <e> <s> the federation of british carpet manufacturers were one of the early victims of the court <e> <s> they were taken to the court and although the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce was one of their counsel he was not able to get them off the charges that were brought against them <e> <s> one of those charges was that they operated a wholesale list <e> <s> that list was for responsible wholesalers i think there were about of them who would be given a wholesale discount and the -odd members of the federation would not give wholesale terms to anyone who was not on that list <e> <s> that was decided by the court as being contrary to public policy and i would say that was a very similar situation to what slade is doing now <e>", "<cs> the intention behind this amendment was much more than unfair dismissal <e> <s> there are many other sections of the employment protection consolidation act which we think are too burdensome on small firms <e> <s> there is the mere fact that they have to give a written contract of employment the fact that they have to make redundancy payments and so forth <e> <s> there are a number of different problems facing them and one has to remember that whatever one does over employment protection the small firms will already have to he burdened with the paye operation which in itself is quite enormous <e> <s> however having said that i can see that i have made no headway with the government so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord wedderburn replies i just want to say that i have been quite mystified as to how far this particular debate has taken us but i believe from what the noble lord the lord chancellor has said that we have been debating not only amendment no <e> <s> n but also the possible effect of taking out subsection of section of the act <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor described it i believe as now being a floating kidney <e> <s> may i claim that our little group had thought of it in very similar terms and we have been considering whether there may not be a better way of making use of subsection than merely removing it from the statute book <e> <s> therefore all i want to say is that we may come forward on report stage with an amendment <e>", "<cs> i want to support this amendment <e> <s> i hope to claim some credit for its construction <e> <s> when our group were thinking about what we should do about clause it was rather opportune that a letter appeared in <e>", "<cs> yes i realise there have been entrenchments but what worries me is that these entrenchments are about to be made by a conservative government because once a conservative government has made these positive entrenchments it is going to be extraordinarily difficult ever to get them altered <e> <s> no future labour government will want to alter them and it is going to be very difficult to find a future conservative government who will want to alter them <e> <s> therefore it seemed to me that this entrenchment of immunities was a dangerous thing and so <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> i accept entirely that he must use a step-by-step approach getting the groundswell up from the union members through to the top <e> <s> but in this situation the groundswell is not from union members it is from non-union members of them whose employment may be placed in jeopardy unless something is done to help them <e> <s> in withdrawing the amendment now i would ask the minister to bear that in mind <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down will he resolve one question for me and i think possibly for a number of my colleagues on the cross-benches <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has said that the words deeply-held personal conviction may include political conviction <e> <s> but can it be turned around the other way <e> <s> we do not have political convictions on these benches but we may object very strongly to joining a union which has political affiliations <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble and learned lord is perfectly right <e> <s> when i spoke this morning i was told that this was sent in his personal capacity and i should like to make that very clear <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it was a slip of the tongue i do not know <e> <s> anyway by removing these immunities completely as we suggest in our amendment all secondary action will put liability on the employees taking it <e> <s> it will be a matter for the employers judgment as to whether he takes any action against any employee and i do not believe that many employers will do so <e> <s> i do not believe that many employers will do so <e> <s> surely the fact that employees are not covered by immunity when they take secondary action will be a curb on the number of <e>", "<cs> my lords first i want to tell my colleagues on the cross-benches that neither my noble friend lord orr-ewing nor myself has any idea as to how many of your lordships will support us and in fact i told the press that yesterday morning <e> <s> you are here and i am very grateful to you for coming to judge for yourselves as a result of this afternoons debate <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always difficult for a cross-bencher to get a hearing but i think i have one now <e> <s> i do not think that the members of my group really consider ourselves as having been a bunker in the words of the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> rather i would say that we think we drove very straight down the fairway whereas the government particularly on clause decided to take a much more difficult path which has taken them through the rough <e> <s> i only hope that they reach the green easily and i want to say that we support this bill to the greatest possible extent <e> <s> meanwhile i hope that we shall be able to keep our little group together because we want to look at the codes of practice when they come out and particularly to see whether they deal with two very objectionable situations which we were not able to put right <e> <s> the first the fair list of the print unions which they use as a black list to try to enforce membership of a closed shop and the second the practice of certain public organisations when they put contracts out to tender to include a clause which insists that the contractors only use members of a trade union <e> <s> in other words again trying to get a closed shop operation in that way <e> <s> also i hope in <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that in all the countries of the common market except for the united kingdom and ireland interest can be charged as a statutory right and is it not time that we caught up with the rest of the common market in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> is it not a fact that while turkey is a member of nato and therefore should be supported also her majestys government are now making financial advances to turkey and would it not therefore be possible for more easy terms to be arranged for british exporters to turkey <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to criticise her majestys government i think that they must be given a fair chance to show whether or not they have it right <e> <s> my points are points of omission pleas to the government to try to put a little more into the bill <e> <s> my interest lies in the creation of small business in order to help remove a little of the unemployment that we have <e> <s> here i want to follow the noble lord lord monk bretton in his remarks about small businesses in rural areas and the danger of rural depopulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord sandford for that information <e> <s> it is encouraging to hear it <e> <s> i only wish that we could make sure that all planning authorities could be equally as positive as the ones he has mentioned <e> <s> despite the fact that i see sitting here the noble baroness lady seear who is chairman of our select committee on unemployment i am just going to mention two small but very important points that seem to be coming through to us while we are taking our evidence there <e> <s> they are in relation to small businesses the lack of suitable premises and secondly the lack of information <e> <s> i believe that both those problems have to be solved at local government level <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers assurance that there will be a relaxation under the directions that will be sent out to planning authorities and with that in mind i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> again i thank the minister for his explanation and i must hope that the circular when it comes out will cover the points that i want <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister arrange that the code of practice should include information to members a substantial body of whom by substantial body i mean at least per cent <e> <s> might want to have a closed shop terminated but are frustrated perhaps by an employer who is weak and union representatives who want to keep the closed shop going <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply but would he not agree that in view of the disgraceful scenes which occurred at the time of the grunwick dispute and which have also occurred since then it is very important that specific warnings should be included in the code <e> <s> paragraph refers to mass picketing but it is not clearly shown there that flying pickets would be included in that phrase and that flying pickets by themselves have no lawful protection as pickets other than as mass demonstrators <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give us an idea of the average length of time it takes for an employer who applies under the youth opportunities programme to obtain the services of an employee <e> <s> i ask this bearing in mind that i know of a case where the employer applied at the beginning of august and only last week was sent a very large envelope through the post costing p in postage which contained the contract and a lot of bumf as well which did not appear to be very relevant to the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister consider that there is something of an anomaly here in the line that he is taking over this answer remembering what happened yesterday on the broadcasting bill when an amendment which would have enabled educational sections to take account of international situations was knocked out as being too restrictive <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree very much with what the noble baroness lady seear has said about codes of practice and the way that governments are now trying to make use of them to shuffle off nasty bits of the legislation which should be in the law or not at all <e> <s> but enough of that <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether these codes are in the format in which they will be published <e> <s> if so i think that they are horribly dreary documents <e> <s> i do not believe that many people are likely to read or to study dreary documents <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords it does but if someone wanted to join a flying picket he would not know where to look to find out whether what he was going to do was legal or not <e> <s> surely we should point out that actions which have been common in the past are now outlawed by the employment act <e> <s> having said that my lords although i sit on this side of the house but not with the opposition i propose to support the government in the lobby today <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to follow the themes which were mentioned by first the right reverend prelate who i see just coming back into his place and i should like to congratulate him on his marvellous maiden speech and secondly the noble lord lord mackie of benshie about small businesses <e> <s> it is less than months since i had the privilege of introducing a debate on unemployment when i made a forecast that by there might well be million unemployed <e> <s> at that time i do not think that many of your lordships agreed with that forecast <e> <s> but it is looking very much closer to what might happen now unless i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening in this debate and i would not have done so except for the fact and i have tried to listen very carefully that i do not believe that anyone has mentioned the plight of the self-employed in this connection <e> <s> therefore briefly i should like to draw the attention of the minister to this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the leader of the house for that answer <e> <s> it is his last point on the allowances which worries me <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that a four-day course was held this year starting at lunchtime on monday and finishing after lunch on friday during which the people attending the course were provided with colour television sets in their rooms and radios with facilities for making early morning tea or coffee and with a three-course breakfast a three-course lunch and a three-course meal in the evening <e> <s> they were also given a subsistence allowance of for the four days <e> <s> it seems to me that that l subsistence allowance is extravagant <e>", "<cs> no one has supported me <e> <s> i am surprised because i thought some noble lords would support a plea for the self-employed but as no one has done so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lords and the noble baroness who have supported me <e> <s> i think it has been useful to have had this little debate we have at least got some arguments down on paper in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for the mention that she made of my fight on behalf of the sell-employed but i feel that i must say a final word about the matter before we put the bill to rest <e> <s> what surprises me and disheartens me considerably is the fact that there has been no support for the self-employed from government benches and when this morning i looked at the records of what happened in another place i found that there had been exactly the same situation there there had been no support for the self-employed from govern <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that per cent <e> <s> of the revenue collected by customs and excise for vat is contributed by fewer than per cent <e> <s> of the firms who are registered for vat <e>", "<cs> i feel i must come to the assistance of the noble lord lord melchett over this <e> <s> we have had a number of expressions from other noble lords with which i am very sympathetic but this amendment will not do what they think it will do <e> <s> for example it only deals with a dog straying from the line of a public path in a field or enclosure <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord very much but that is not the point <e> <s> i rather support his ideas but i think he has to introduce a much wider amendment <e> <s> this amendment would not deal with a dog which strayed through any field in which there were sheep which did not have a public path running through it <e> <s> it is so limited in its present drafting that it is really useless <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> this afternoon i received a copy of the spicer committees recommendations <e> <s> i hope that the minister will find himself able to accept them <e> <s> regarding the remarks of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby i did not draft this amendment so the committee is getting my own interpretation of it <e> <s> we had to start with the lowest denominator of where a horse and rider can go which is a bridleway <e> <s> then we get a road used as a public path and finally a byway open to all traffic <e> <s> those are three separate tracks over which a ridden horse can travel <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> the reason why we put highways into the amendment was in order to parallel section of the highways act <e> <s> i am inclined to agree that that is too broad a definition and that something a little lower down the scale would be better <e> <s> with that in mind i hope the noble lord the minister will consider the possibility of dealing with this problem which is very serious <e> <s> i will take it back to the british horse society and see what they have to say about it <e> <s> in the meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was expecting the attacks that i received and i had in fact consulted the british horse society this afternoon about them <e> <s> its reply was that this has been its policy since <e> <s> therefore i do not quite understand why the breed societies have heard nothing about it <e> <s> there must be a failure of communication there <e> <s> however i think that we must allow the british horse society to clear up its own internal worries on this and it can of course always bring forward amendments in another place <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the walker does not come into this <e> <s> it is between farmer and rider and it deals only with bridleways not footpaths <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not know the internal workings of the british horse society but they briefed me on this and it is they who say that they have quite a number of instances of accidents occurring as a result of contact with electric fences <e> <s> i have a letter which draws my attention to the fact saying that what makes the amendment so necessary is the probable increase in the use of permanently-sited mains-electric fencing <e> <s> this gives a sharper shock than the portable battery-powered fences now used <e> <s> mains-electric fencing is happening <e> <s> it is a particular danger to horses because they are thin-skinned animals are iron shod and are often sweating <e> <s> therefore they are much more susceptible to electric shock <e> <s> however the government do not appear to be interested in the amendment at the moment <e> <s> i shall send it back to the british horse society with the suggestion that they get it taken up in another place <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for that reply which is encouraging so far as it goes <e> <s> will the minister tell us how many independent members of wages councils sit on more than one council <e> <s> even though by doubling up there may be a saving of expense would it not be true to say that it is very difficult for somebody who sits on four five six or seven wages councils to be truly impartial in his consideration of the problems of any one <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> would the minister not agree though that the fact that many of these awards were ante-dated is an encouragement to inflation which would otherwise not arise <e> <s> would he not also agree that the fact that these awards are spread over the whole country and give the same award over very large numbers of small and medium businesses in different areas must not only be inflationary but likely to be restrictive of job opportunities <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to begin by saying that i was surprised that until my speech no one had spoken up on behalf of the public the innocent third party <e> <s> but the noble lord lord ferrier has just anticipated me a little in his speech <e> <s> i entirely agree with him that it is the public who are fed up with the treatment that they are getting at the moment and for which they have no redress <e> <s> i believe and i support the noble lord lord renton in this that something must be done and done quickly to enable them to get that redress <e> <s> to this extent i am afraid that i do not agree with the noble earl lord de la warr that no further legislation is necessary <e> <s> i believe that further legislation is necessary but it could be contrived in a way that ought not to affect relationships between employers and employees <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is the situation at present <e> <s> therefore there would be no difference if secondary picketing were to be made liable under the civil law <e> <s> it would only be liable to third parties <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord scanlon that if one of those third parties started to help an employer then the unions should have their immunity to deal with him he would no longer be a third party <e> <s> but otherwise there should be no immunity for damage done to innocent third parties to members of the public <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a hereditary peer and i do not sit on the government benches <e> <s> in fact i believe that yesterday i voted against the government five times <e> <s> but today i am going to support the government on the merits of the case <e> <s> i consider that to impose the register of business names on to the companies registry would make bad matters absolutely chaotic <e> <s> the register of business names itself is chaotic <e> <s> the companies registry is a bit better <e> <s> but if you suddenly land it with this awful register of business names to take over as well the companies registry will get very much worse <e> <s> i therefore support the government <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether these small industrial workshops can be rented <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the recent meeting of the cyprus foreign minister mr rolandis with officials here in london to discuss compensation for the british bases has caused enormous resentment on the turkish cypriot side because there was no consultation <e> <s> is the noble lord the minister aware that of the property in the british bases turkish cypriots own more than per cent <e> <s> and will he assure us that the turkish cypriots will be consulted before any final decision on this matter is taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to keep your lordships for very long

gratified <e> <s> it has been an excellent debate which has spread over a very wide field <e> <s> i do not propose to refer to what every speaker has said but one or two points have come out of the debate <e> <s> first most of us feel that the government could do a little more <e> <s> we have suggested various ways <e> <s> we have asked the government to look again carefully at the clauses in the finance bill which deal with the new business start-up scheme <e> <s> i agree so very much with what was said on that matter by the opposition spokesman <e> <s> i do not understand it and i am an accountant <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble earl does <e> <s> i omitted one point from my opening speech and i should like to refer to it now <e> <s> the people who are going to contribute whether to the start-up scheme or to my friends of small businesses scheme or whatever have got to turn it into cash in order to make a contribution <e> <s> at the moment capital gains tax may be charged <e> <s> may i ask whether there is any possibility that raising money for this purpose could be freed from the charge to capital gains tax <e> <s> i should like the minister to think about this point <e>", "<cs> my lords is it true that the government had some weeks of prior knowledge that the tuc were going to put in a last-minute submission in this case <e> <s> is it also true that the government even gave some assistance to the tuc to make their submission <e> <s> is it further true that the government did not have the courtesy to warn the three railway employees or their legal advisers that those last-minute submissions were going to be made <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to keep your lordships very long on this matter but i would say that i support the noble lord lord houghton in his initial statement in that i would hate to see any more of our very restricted liberties further restricted <e> <s> if i may make a very short aside to the noble lord lord nugent of guildford i shall not be able to be present tomorrow afternoon when a very important amendment is going to be debated because i shall be attending a meeting of a select committee but i shall apply that policy to any vote that takes place <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord houghton decides what to do i am as i think all noble lords know a very keen supporter of the very small businessman and i must draw your lordships attention to the fact that very small newsagents generally carry some of this material in their shops <e> <s> they probably make their profits by being able to sell this material <e> <s> the small village shop certainly does not have the space to produce what is described in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister agree that there are a number of restrictive practices operated by the trade unions which are preventing employers from taking on more employees <e>", "<cs> i have listened to almost every moment of this debate and i must say that i am more and more confused as the time goes on <e> <s> we have heard a lot of emotional speeches too but the only one which really made sense was the very short speech made by a noble lord on the opposite side of the committee who said that we must realise that clause deals only with children who are not yet born it does not deal with anyone who is in this country at the moment <e> <s> those children who are not yet born if they are born to a british citizen or to someone settled in this country will be british citizens so where are the millions who are going to be worried by immigration officers and so forth <e> <s> they are not here <e> <s> i cannot see what all this worry is about <e> <s> i believe this clause is perfectly good and i propose to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not spoken previously and so i think i am in order in seeking to speak now <e> <s> i feel that i must support the amendment though i understand the reasons why the minister wants the machine to operate alone <e> <s> any machine no matter how accurate is only as accurate as the extent of the fallibility of the human being who is involved with it whether he installs it calibrates it or operates it <e> <s> therefore i cannot believe that we ought to rely only on the results of a machine <e> <s> we must give the individual concerned the opportunity of an alternative choice <e>", "<cs> my lords i put down my name to this amendment so i must explain the reason that i am utterly opposed to compulsion in the wearing of seat belts <e> <s> in my case it is a personal reason but i think i ought to give it to your lordships <e> <s> my eldest son some years ago turned his car over on an icy road <e> <s> he was flung from the car and is still alive <e> <s> if he had been wearing a seat belt he would be dead <e> <s> that is sufficient reason for me to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name to this amendment for the reason i gave earlier <e> <s> this thing has happened to my own son <e> <s> he was thrown out of a car having turned it over on an icy road and he is still alive <e> <s> i believe that my son is going to find it difficult to comply with this compulsion to wear a seat belt <e> <s> although that accident happened before provisions like those in this bill became law i do not suppose under this drafting that it could be held to be a defence in his case but if it were to happen again to him and it might do so if he does not wear his seat belt then i think he ought to have a defence <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us what is the situation about educational arrangements in view of an article which appeared in one of yesterdays papers saying that the commissioners of customs and excise are now clamping down on arrangements for school travel and things like that because those matters are no longer being subsidised by the local authorities <e>", "<cs> i must certainly study what has been said by the noble and learned lord the minister this afternoon <e> <s> i do not propose to press this amendment today <e> <s> i should just like to make one point <e> <s> the noble lord talked about discrimination but surely discrimination is there already <e> <s> discrimination is there when a person who was naturalised last week can go abroad and live abroad for the rest of his life marry a foreigner and their children will become british <e> <s> i should have thought that that was more <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask that question too and in fact i did ask it when i proposed amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not

<e> <s> under the act she is at present a citizen of the united kingdom and colonies by descent <e> <s> but apparently under clause when this new bill becomes an act she will cease to be a citizen by descent so what does she become <e>", "<cs> we have had a very interesting debate on this and i am most grateful to the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls for his support <e> <s> i am disappointed with the minister in that he funked the suggestion which i put to him that within years employment may not be so important a situation as it is today <e> <s> no one knows that <e> <s> he spoke about having the rug pulled out from under his feet <e> <s> that might be what is going to happen within the next years <e> <s> so in a bill which i would suppose is to last us for to years why tie yourself to such a detailed narrow definition as employment <e> <s> however i am not going to divide the committee on this tonight but i hope the minister will think about it again <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for what he has just said and also to the noble lord lord belstead because he has kept this subject open <e> <s> i will certainly take it away and i hope that i shall get assistance from all sides of your lordships house in trying to devise some formula which will meet the wishes of the government <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us how the prescription charge of relates to the average cost of the service which is being provided <e>", "<cs> the minister knows my views about employment as the only tag on which to hang this <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government given consideration to abolishing the may day hank holiday which seems to be a completely useless bank holiday close to two others <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e> <s> zc <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply and i am certainly not going to press this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give an assurance that this policy is accorded also to the or so turkish cypriots who were forced out of their homes between and and who are now in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the noble lord lord barnby has decided not to speak in this debate and so i am rising now to address your lordships for a very short time <e> <s> as you know my particular interest is small businesses and i felt that i must speak today because two months ago when we had a debate on small businesses i criticised the clauses dealing with the business start-up scheme in the then finance bill <e> <s> i said then that its scope is limited to the first three years of the life of a business to cover only per cent <e> <s> of the equity of that business and it is only for businesses which among other limitations on their nature may not deal in goods <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to support this amendment but i am going to criticise not the amendment itself but what i now think is perhaps something quite serious over the whole of clause <e> <s> i say that because clause is now creating quite a large community of britons living abroad who will be able because they are in the armed services in the service of the crown or in the service of the communities to have their children born abroad and those children will not be british citizens by descent whereas anyone who is not in a so-called public service will come under clause and the children will be citizens by descent <e> <s> is that fair <e> <s> is it right that children of persons in some form of public service can get away with being british citizens without being british citizens by descent if they are born abroad whereas all the rest will not get away <e>", "<cs> my lord i welcome this amendment enormously <e> <s> i think that it goes very much further than we had reason to expect and it certainly solves the problem of the self-employed which was one of the matters about which i was worried <e> <s> in fact i now see no reason why i should move amendment no <e> <s> so i give notice that i shall not be moving that amendment which was drafted to try to deal with the problem of the self-employed <e> <s> i also welcome the amendment because it has done away with the qualification of employment which was a matter which worried many of us <e> <s> this qualification is so very much better although it is wider <e> <s> nevertheless i hope that the amendment will be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount tell us to what extent the banks are offering these loans to businesses which they would not otherwise have considered worthy of the loans <e> <s> or are they just passing the buck to the government and offering the loans only to creditworthy businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard the defence of the noble lord the minister i wish to support the amendment <e> <s> i think that his defence was really only technical in its scope and i believe that the technicalities which might worry the british immigration officials can most easily be got round by entering in the passport british national a citizen of the british dependent territories or british national a british overseas citizen <e> <s> something like that which is very simple could be an entry and an immigration official would have no difficulty in sorting out who the person was <e>", "<cs> my lords i have understood but i do not agree with the explanations and i am very surprised at the noble lord the minister coming out <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his suggestion that one should carry a spare pair of glasses is a very expensive suggestion <e> <s> is he further aware that i am now wearing a new pair of national health glasses which cost me and when i asked for a spare pair i was told that would cost me between and <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that is a very satisfactory answer <e> <s> may i ask do not her majestys government consider that a situation where nearly million people are unemployed of whom more than are under with a high proportion of those being persons who have not yet been able to find their first job is a situation of economic emergency <e> <s> will <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is quite a lot of frustration among employers who offer vacancies under this scheme at the length of time it takes for them and their vacancies to be vetted <e> <s> for example i believe that employers in the middle of kent have to wait for someone from the msc to come from horsham in order to vet them and in many cases it takes three months or more <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he has had time to consider the suggestion on the wages councils which i put to him about three or four weeks ago that the government should declare an economic state of emergency and suspend minimum wage rates particularly for the young people who are unemployed who are now being priced out of jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister very much for that reply <e> <s> if i may i should like to congratulate <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way for a moment on that <e> <s> the redundancy fund <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to thank all of your lordships who took part in this debate which i believe has been extremely interesting <e> <s> i should particularly like to thank the minister for his remarks <e> <s> he has obviously listened very carefully to what we have said and i am quite certain that he will get the government to think again on some of the points and the very interesting new suggestions which have been put to him this evening <e> <s> i do not wish to say much more except to point out that i did not wish to imply in my own suggestions that i wanted to see employers getting into an overmanning situation again <e> <s> no what i am afraid of is that as the recession turns and i think it is about to turn employers will not have the encouragement to carry out the expansion which will then be necessary for the increased demand which i hope will come along <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the size of the black economy may not be as great as people say <e> <s> for example there are million pensioners and each pensioner is entitled to earn a year before he comes within the purview of the inland revenue <e> <s> if they were all to earn a year that would be billion of perfectly legitimate economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to abolish wages councils <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that most of us accept the fact that all of the million people still in work should contribute a bit more towards the three million who are out of work <e> <s> in that million still in work there are very nearly million self-employed people <e> <s> i was very pleased to hear the minister say that the government realise that they must still offer incentives to small businesses and that therefore they have not increased the contributions for the self-employed by possibly the full rates that they should have done actuarially <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the government whether they will express a view though on this point if a commercial enterprise were to open up shop in say paris or new york to sell only goods produced under the royal warrant would the government support or would they frown upon that enterprise if it started displaying the emblem of the royal warrant in the shop <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this little debate <e> <s> it gives me a lot of heart to hear the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter speaking up on behalf of the self-employed in this way <e> <s> i am very grateful for his support <e> <s> i agree with him that the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne did not really make out a very good case against my point <e> <s> certainly arithmetically it would be quite easy to make the calculations for which i have asked <e> <s> however i realise that it is not something which the government can give away quickly <e> <s> i hope that they will bear it in mind for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that a symposium of directors of research of about a dozen of the largest companies has now started to meet fairly regularly under the chairmanship of the professor of cybernetics at brunel university in order to see whether they can establish some form of library of research products which individual companies perhaps no longer need to use but which otherwise might lie on their shelves unused by anyone else <e> <s> they are having a meeting next week i think and i am pretty sure that they have invited a representative of the nrdc <e>", "<cs> my lords i put it at the beginning <e> <s> i said is the minister aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am most grateful to the noble lord lord northfield for raising this matter <e> <s> this is a very timely moment to do so <e> <s> however before going on to the question itself i want to make a very brief plea to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> this morning there was a meeting unfortunately not very well attended of our small businesses group and we were addressed by a banker who gave us some very interesting figures <e> <s> he said something which surprised me enormously <e> <s> it was that per cent <e> <s> of the total value of loans made by banks for businesses were now being made for businesses with fewer than employees <e> <s> that is a very interesting fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> first i want to thank the noble earl lord ferrers for giving me such a detailed written answer on th march to my question about awards made or proposed by some wages councils during the lifetime of this government it appeared at columns and of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not worked that out <e> <s> i have no doubt the noble lord himself will do so if he wants to speak <e> <s> i am now going on to the accessories which happened with the wages councils awards <e> <s> i think the best one to look at is the non-food proposal which is due to come into effect on th april <e> <s> there are points intended to take effect from th april increases in minimum rates for all workers reduction in the number of separate categories of workers to four the establishment of common rates for workers outside london by merging provincial areas a and b an increase in the differential to per week for all workers in london no deduction specified for the provision of meals and/or accommodation four weeks annual holiday for workers with at least months service with a proportionately increased holiday entitlement for workers with less than months service the additional day of customary holiday provided for in the christmas and new year period to be taken between rd december and nd january and other changes which have resulted from the harmonisation of the three wages orders whereby certain conditions already applicable to workers in one or more of the three trades have been extended to the others and of course they have always been extended upwards <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords and to the noble baroness lady seear whom i see departing for their contributions this afternoon <e> <s> we have had a very interesting debate <e> <s> i do not propose to summarise the debate again because the noble earl lord ferrers has done that very well for me <e> <s> i want to make just two points <e> <s> the first point is that which the noble earl lord ferrers finished up with our international obligation <e> <s> it seems to me that there is no reason why we cannot continue or ratification of this convention yet abolish wages councils <e> <s> the provision in article of the convention says only that there is the need to make these arrangements for collective agreements where wages are exceptionally low <e> <s> i do not believe that wages are exceptionally low any longer <e> <s> we now have welfare state benefits which protect member employees from such a situation <e> <s> therefore i do not see why the government cannot just say that wages are no longer exceptionally low exceptionally remember and go ahead with abolishing the councils without <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to hear that <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord had said that he was not going to divide against me at second reading but at any further stage <e> <s> i feel that i should like to go ahead and so my lords i beg to press the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble viscount the minister any evidence to suggest that the banks are making use of this facility to make risk loans as he describes them to businesses which they would not otherwise have been prepared to help finance <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a sense of urgency is also necessary because of the evolution of new technologies which are now gaining speed and which we hope will result in the evolution of a lot of new service industries <e> <s> surely we ought to be protected in the same way as these other countries are protected by having some form of service marks protection <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord kilmarnock on a masterly introduction to this debate <e> <s> i think i can call him my noble friend although he has crossed the narrow gangway recently but he and i have been concerned together for more than three years about the problem of unemployment and to that extent he is certainly my noble friend <e> <s> i do not think that i am as optimistic as he about the youth task group scheme <e> <s> it seems to me to be running into the danger of creating a further bureaucracy <e> <s> i myself have never been very happy with the way that the msc have started to run the present youth opportunities programme <e> <s> the bureaucracy there has been quite frustrating for would-be sponsors <e> <s> they have to fill in enormous piles of paper and then sit about waiting for someone from the msc to come along and vet them <e> <s> that often takes three or four months and by that time their enthusiasm has disappeared and they are no longer interested <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness makes a very important point and it is one which i believe has to be debated over a long period given the opportunity of a full debate <e> <s> my own feeling is this the new technologies are producing ways of increasing productivity while not creating further jobs <e> <s> the machines are themselves creating better machines which will carry out the additional requirements for productivity but there will not be the human element to come in there <e> <s> i think that we are faced with this awful problem of perhaps from million to million people being unemployed for the next years <e>", "<cs> i was approached by my borough health officer for ashford in kent and also by the institution of environmental health officers to oppose amendments nos <e> <s> and to this bill <e> <s> they do not consider that they are good amendments they do not consider that they have been given enough time for adequate consultation since the amendments were first introduced in another place and they consider that if they were to be accepted the bill would be seriously weakened <e> <s> so i hope that the noble lord <e> <s> lord mottistone will see his way clear to not pressing his amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that rather inconclusive reply may i ask if he can say whether there is any indication that there has been any large increase in the consumption of alcohol as a result of the change <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i believe that the members of your lordships recent select committee on unemployment who issued a report last week and i think that there is only one other member present in the chamber today will be very pleased indeed with this statement because it accepts two of the select committees recommendations namely that the minimum wage should be and that the element of compulsion should be removed <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to mention that in reply to the noble lord lord mottistone he said that he would not be able to introduce regulations very quickly <e> <s> i fear that i have something of a suspicious mind and i would draw the noble lords attention to subsections and of clause <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that our unilateral abandonment of the production of chemical weapons far from encouraging other nations to abandon them in fact seems to have encouraged them to increase their manufacture <e>", "<cs> if i may make one small addition to what the noble viscount has just said i have asked the library to make a quick calculation of the increase in the retail price index since st january <e> <s> to date it has risen by per cent <e> <s> which means that the value of any awards to anyone in has gone down by at least per cent <e> <s> and should therefore he doubled in order to bring about a reasonable and satisfactory compensation <e>", "<cs> may i answer the point made by the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> i have in front of me the same journal from the department of employment from which i extracted that increase in the retail price index <e> <s> it shows also the increase in average earnings <e> <s> since the increase in average earnings amounts to per cent <e> <s> so i do not think that any of the million trade unionists mentioned by the noble lord lord molloy have any need to worry about the situation <e>", "<cs> may i add a word to what the noble viscount has said <e> <s> i think we are now moving into a situation where deeply held personal convictions may not have been held for very long <e> <s> we are certainly moving into a situation where unions are becoming much more political and it can be easily in my mind apparent to a member of a union subject to a closed shop that that union has started to indulge in activities that that member no longer agrees with <e> <s> this amend <e>", "<cs> i am most surprised at the attitude both of her majestys government and of the opposition on this amendment

employer to give a written <e>", "<cs> i thank those who have taken part in this very short debate <e> <s> i certainly have no intention of pressing this amendment at this time <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it and at the same time i give notice that i shall not move amendments and which are in my name but i reserve the right to bring them back again at report possibly in a slightly different

my noble friend lord seebohm for not being in the chamber at the very beginning of his speech <e> <s> i wonder whether he dealt with what i consider to be the most misleading title of this debate <e>

otherwise <e> <s> as i was walking along the embankment yesterday morning coming to the house i met a member of the staff of the institute of directors and he drew my attention to what in fact the

my lords i hope that i shall be constructive and i want to say how much i agree with everything that the noble lord lord caradon has just said about cyprus <e> <s> i think he has made a most impressive speech and has put the situation into a very good perspective <e> <s> having said that i must attack the noble lord lord brockway for his attack on turkey <e> <s> it is so easy to start from th july the day that the turkish army went into cyprus but i believe that the real blame for what happened then rests with the british foreign secretary at the time who was approached repeatedly by mr ecevit the turkish prime minister who begged him to come in and stop the insurrection which had happened five days earlier <e> <s> your lordships may remember that between th and th july a man called sampson started up this insurrection in cyprus kicked out president makarios and very nearly killed him <e> <s> we rescued him i think just in time <e>", "<cs> my lords has the pink form that

appears in volume iii on page <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment for slightly different reasons from those of the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> i did so because i believe that section gives very important powers to local authorities particularly in the fight against unemployment <e> <s> the powers allow an authority to help local businesses to start up or expand and they are handled by chief executives who have their ears to the ground and who know about businesses and about the need for them <e> <s> i remember that two years ago i was so enthusiastic about this power that i suggested that instead of a p rate there should be a p rate in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord rugby i beg to introduce a bill to repeal section and subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that the level of unemployment is directly linked to the total number of jobs available and that with the rapid increase of technology the total number of jobs available is likely to decrease over the next few years and therefore the level of unemployment is not likely to go down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very tempted to follow the ideas

act section of <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name down to speak in this debate not because i have anything new to contribute but because i felt as certain other people do that there is a great worry about the state of the public monopoly which is being transferred into a private duopoly <e> <s> i found myself at a meeting with a number of your lordships from all parts of the house except for one and i found myself being given the honour of being elected chairman of a group of which the noble lord lord orr-ewing was secretary <e> <s> we decided to call ourselves the telecommunications liberalisation group <e> <s> our efforts will be not to try to stop this bill from going through but to try to alter it in such ways as can introduce more aspects of competition and fair play than we

my speech on second reading i issued an open-ended invitation to any noble lord in your lordships house to join the group <e> <s> i think that that invitation was picked up by one or two noble lords <e>", "<cs> i feel that i must at this stage talk a little about our liberalisation group <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington has put a slur on our group which i do not think is acceptable <e> <s> to start with i do not believe that the noble lord lord mottistone ever <e>", "<cs> may i intervene <e> <s> we are not talking about the million unemployed <e> <s> we are talking about some very specialist people who are required in the office of the director of british telecom <e>", "<cs> i am not at all sure that i understand what the noble lord lord bruce of donington was getting at in quoting condition <e> <s> condition begins <e>", "<cs> i am sympathetic towards the amendment <e> <s> it establishes or attempts to continue a fine principle that was established many years ago with the introduction of the penny post <e> <s> the penny post was the only charge irrespective of distance <e> <s> we need something of that kind in the bill because as the noble baroness lady macleod said there is no mention of charges in the bill <e>", "<cs> i have looked at clause and i do not think that it meets our point in any way <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> the reason that i do not think that clause is satisfactory is that it does not give any duty to the director <e> <s> the duties are conferred by clause and that is why we should like to see this amendment agreed to <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is any conflict between clause and my amendment because clause is confined to telecommunications systems which are defined in clause and which are limited to the system <e>", "<cs> i am most encouraged by the speech of the noble lord the minister and i am very pleased that he is prepared to table these amendments himself <e> <s> the reason i say that is because i have seen a draft of them but it has been spirited away to the bahamas and i would have had to ask the noble lord to send me another copy <e> <s> in any event i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> i think that i am satisfied by it <e> <s> anyway i shall take it away look at it and discuss it with the water authorities to see what they think about it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> are not the government providing british telecom with a very easy method of discriminating against smaller users of specialist groups of numbers <e> <s> it is so easy for british telecom to say that no numbers are available <e> <s> i understand that is something which they are already doing <e> <s> so i hope that the noble lord will think again on this one <e>", "<cs> i understand that there are million numbers which could be made available <e> <s> i cannot believe that there could be any shortage of groups of numbers <e>", "<cs> i think that at this stage i can refer to my amendment no <e> <s> which also asks for the advisory bodies to represent users <e> <s> if we agree to amendment no <e> <s> b as i hope we shall there will be an advisory body for small businesses but that will not cover all the users who are small in comparison with british telecom but large in comparison with the normal small business <e> <s> i should therefore like to see this amendment carried <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for tabling these amendments <e> <s> they satisfy our worries very well <e> <s> i support them wholly <e>", "<cs> i think that amendment no <e> <s> has to be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> may i draw the attention of the committee to the reply given by the noble and learned lord lord mackay of clashfern to lord mottistone when he was debating amendment no <e> <s> at col of yesterdays <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this amendment if only because it brings a little clarity into what is almost as incomprehensible a bill as the telecommunications bill <e> <s> it mentions consultation with the director and nowhere else in the bill is there any allusion to the director or to oftel <e> <s> but there is a very peculiar subsection in clause which i suspect the noble lord the minister will quote at us as being the kind of subsection which is mandatory upon the authority <e> <s> subsection states <e>", "<cs> my lords i also supported the amendment last time and i will continue to do so because i think the point made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington that anything in clause can be modified by clause is valid particularly if one reads clause which says <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment but i want to tackle it from a different point of view <e> <s> in committee my noble friend lord mottistone introduced amendment no <e> <s> to this subsection and which asked for the prevention of uncompetitive practices <e> <s> i supported that amendment but i was told by the noble and learned lord lord mackay of clashfern that it was all covered under clause and that all we had to do was leave it to the director of oftel to exercise his functions under that clause <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord mackay of clashfern even went on to explain that this particular subsection would anyway be outside the scope of the director of oftel because of a little paragraph clause <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether he would agree with me that if subsection <e>", "<cs> no my lords it does not because he has not answered my question <e> <s> can the director of oftel in fact operate subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all happy with that explanation <e> <s> i have said that there are no duties under the competition act yet the noble lord the minister began to talk about duties under that act <e> <s> there are functions yes but there are no duties <e> <s> i want to see imposed upon the director general of oftel the duty to take positive action against anti-competitive practices <e> <s> at this late hour i do not propose to divide the house but i propose to have another look at whether or not i can bring back at a later stage of the bill the point that i am making <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support this amendment and following on the remarks of the noble viscount lord trenchard i should like to draw attention to a question for written answer which is down in my name and indicates that the office of fair trading has taken more than two years to reach a conclusion <e> <s> that i think is likely to be the length of time that the director of british telecom may take before he reaches a conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he show us anywhere where swiftness of action by the director is written into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to embark on a diatribe about clause but i have agreed with the noble lord lord glenarthur that i will not move my two amendments concerning that clause <e> <s> the explanation given for clause is not very satisfactory <e> <s> the noble lord the minister kept on talking about all and used the phrase all <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak for a very short moment on amendments nos <e> <s> and which seem to me to give the government the answer to lord orr-ewings question <e> <s> here if you were to set up an advisory body for matters concerned with the allocation use and licensing of civil radio frequencies here would be the body which could be self-regulating and which could do the monitoring which is absolutely essential and which one understands is not being done very efficiently at the moment <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord the minister will consider that option as a possible way of agreeing to the request of the noble lord lord orr-ewing <e>", "<cs> my lords when i introduced the liberalisation group to your lordships on second reading i think i made it clear that we did not necessarily support everything that every member of the group wanted to see happen <e> <s> but what we did was to work on amendments to try to get more competition into the bill on the basis that as regards time the bill was going to go through in the way it had been drafted <e> <s> i do not think i could possibly support the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran who was a very useful member of our group in his statement now that we ought to delay the vesting of the interests of the present british telecom in the new company <e>", "<cs> my lords i am an amateur on this bill and i feel very much like the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> i have been trying to find out where part i of schedule a to this bill exists <e> <s> if one looks at clause one sees that it says <e>", "<cs> no my lords i want to know where part i of schedule a is <e> <s> i know where schedule a is it is in schedule but there does not seem to be a part i <e>", "<cs> my lords that still does not help me as to part i of schedule a <e> <s> if i look at schedule i can see schedule a but i cannot see part i yet this amendment inserts after the word with the words part i or <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what has been said by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran because i agreed with and supported him previously <e> <s> i hope that clause will now be brought in with clauses and to become a clause which cannot be altered in the licence <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can now sign off as the chairman of our liberalisation group <e> <s> in doing so i should like to thank the members of our group for the help and support they have given <e> <s> sixteen members have contributed to our debate and that is not including the noble lord lord weinstock with whom we have kept in close touch <e> <s> i want to thank also the ministers on the front bench for their acceptance of some of our requests and their forbearance particularly towards me in my anxiety to ensure that the director general of oftel shall have a positive duty to tackle anti-competitive practices <e>", "<cs> my lords i can be brief because everything that i wanted to say has already been said far more eloquently by other noble lords <e> <s> i support the bill because i believe that our democracy is based here in the sovereignty of parliament and i believe that that is the only true democracy in this country <e> <s> as the noble lord lord broxbourne explained that sovereignty is absolute <e> <s> it is not limited <e> <s> it is not limited either by a written constitution or by any form of federal constitution <e> <s> it is absolutely absolute and as such is operative by her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank her majestys government for this series of amendments <e> <s> admittedly it took me quite a long time this morning before the availability of documents a and b which i got only a few moments ago to work out exactly what was meant because the amendments relate to the original bill before it was amended in your lordships house <e> <s> i think clause has been amended at every stage in this house including third reading which meant that there was no up-to-date text of it to look at this morning <e> <s> the amendments made by another place are quite excellent because they have now put on to the director a duty where previously it was only a possibility that he might issue a provisional order <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the post office grants concessions to bulk users of mail irrespective of whether or not they use post codes <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to the two noble lords who have spoken from the opposition front bench the noble lords lord underhill and lord graham <e> <s> i do not think either has mentioned the body of ratepayers who have to pay more than per cent <e> <s> of the total rates namely the business ratepayers <e> <s> they talked a lot about consultation but there never has been consultation with the business community <e> <s> until that happens i cannot see why we should support an amendment of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the national insurance surcharge is in process of being abolished will her majestys government give attention to the equally iniquitous class iv national insurance contribution which is charged against self-employed profits without any part of that tax being allowed to be charged as a labour expense <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a great privilege to follow the noble lord lord thorneycroft because his stimulating speeches are enjoyed by all of us even those on the opposition benches <e> <s> i am going to be a little more pessimistic than anyone who has spoken so far but at the same time i shall probably be a little provocative <e> <s> i had the privilege of being a member of the select committee on unemployment of your lordships house which was referred to by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i found there that there was a fundamental disagreement between myself and one or two others who like me believe that we shall never again see full employment and those the majority on the committee who believe that history will repeat itself and that out of the ashes of our present unemployment will arise the phoenix of new industries to restore full employment once again <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not often oppose the noble lord <e> <s> lord mottistone but today i am afraid that i am going to oppose him completely because i support the case made out by the noble lord <e> <s> lord rugby and the noble lord lord orr-ewing <e> <s> i am a little distressed to see that the noble baroness whose
