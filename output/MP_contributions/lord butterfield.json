["<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord rea for his lucid explanation of the background to the bill and particularly for introducing the bill just at this time <e> <s> it provides me with an opportunity to make this maiden speech on topics with which i am familiar so making the occasion marginally less daunting than going in to bat for the first time at lords cricket ground <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to my noble friend lord hunter for giving us the opportunity to debate the white paper so soon after its publication <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow the noble lord lord trafford in welcoming the bill which i sense will receive its third reading <e> <s> i too congratulate the noble lord lord rea on the successful way he has negotiated the bill through this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may make a modest and i hope helpful suggestion regarding one point raised this evening by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i refer to legal aid to help persons suffering from permanent illnesses to make their wills <e> <s> the noble lord asked what is meant by the phrase permanent illness <e> <s> it occurred to me from my medical background that it might be helpful to link the legal definition with the list of permanent illnesses under which nhs patients are allowed to have their medicines free of charge <e> <s> such a device could get around the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with the views and thanks expressed to the noble baroness lady blackstone for initiating this debate <e> <s> the noble baroness has initiated a move carrying us forward on a wonderful tidal wave <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may crave your lordships indulgence <e> <s> i had hoped to insert myself between the noble lord lord seebohm and the noble lord lord mccarthy <e>", "<cs> my lords like so many other speakers in this excellent debate i too should like <e>", "<cs> my lords i came prepared to speak in the debate about the support that i should like to offer for many of the matters in the document which is the subject of this prayer <e> <s> i should like the noble lord lord ennals to know that i was very proud to serve under him when he was secretary of state i was always very well received by him <e> <s> i had <e>", "<cs> my lords i am speaking in the gap before the noble lords who are to wind up the debate and i am most grateful to your lordships for your indulgence so that i may make just two points <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord prys-davies for yielding to my request to speak now <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my appreciation to my noble friend lord hunter of newington for initiating this debate <e> <s> i am very intrigued by the reference on the order paper to present uncertainties and possible solutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am your watershed <e> <s> perhaps i may pick up the point of the noble baroness lady nicol and say that i wish to support clause <e> <s> it is not very easy as she knows well to know how to proceed to help the case for clause <e> <s> one way i thought i might try to help is by pursuing the line of reporting about the kinds of people who are involved if your lordships would need any convincing that they are splendid dedicated people <e> <s> one must congratulate those who have been involved with research in embryos over the past five years <e> <s> people like anne mclaren and professor geoffrey dawes are great scientists who have given much dedicated time to this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i also add my appreciation and congratulation to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i crave the indulgence of the house for a few moments <e> <s> this has been a fascinating debate and during it it occurred to me that we might ask the minister to encourage the des to explore setting up a new angle on the training scheme <e> <s> that would involve offering eventually tokens for training or retraining to mothers who elected to make themselves available at home to offer a stable family background for their growing children to come home to <e> <s> the worth of the tokens would obviously depend i suppose on the value all of us put on the familys role in society <e> <s> however i put the idea forward because i believe it would be good for the morale of all those mothers married or unmarried who battle on with family life when children can impose such a heavy burden on them <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor can answer this question <e> <s> is it not true that the use of drugs would come under the provisions of the medicines act <e> <s> therefore would it not be for the medicines commission to decide whether such treatments were safe <e> <s> it seems to me that there is a risk here of some reduplication so far as concerns the use of medicines in these circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl lord caithness for introducing the bill in the way that he did <e> <s> i am on my feet to make some remarks very largely out of sorrow <e> <s> just at a time when it seemed that we should be doing all we can to increase the participation of our young people in higher and further education in order to provide the best opportunities for future competitiveness we are about to take steps to create diversions which may inhibit some people from going to colleges and universities <e> <s> that is why i support the noble earl lord russell in his amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very pleased to have the opportunity to support the amendment <e> <s> i have been drawn into the debate very much by concern on the one side about individual student finance and on the other by the countrys need for increased participation in education higher education in particular <e>", "<cs> is the minister prepared to indicate whether he has made any inquiries of the royal college of nursing and members of the nursing and allied professions who are intending to make theirs a graduate profession in the coming century <e> <s> it could involve quite large numbers of people proceeding to some kind of degree in nursing <e> <s> i think that it should also be regarded as a form of training which is valuable to the community <e> <s> i should just like the minister to indicate whether he has had the opportunity to talk to the nurses about the matter <e> <s> i am thinking of the steps taken to bring into being the briggs report of about years ago <e>", "<cs> i rise to make a few remarks about the problems facing students in medicine veterinary medicine dentistry and increasingly in engineering <e> <s> i do not wish to pre-empt what may be discussed under a later amendment but it seems to me that ways may well have to be found so that students who are going to embark on these long courses are able to be covered by grants or bursaries for what we would call the clinical part of their subject <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly share with the committee a remark i stumbled across when reading up francis bacon later lord verulam <e> <s> this brief quotation is very germane to the difficulties we seem to be experiencing in regard to information <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will not be cross with me for adding to the plea for consideration of that point <e> <s> my point relates to the extension of the general course of training for doctors dentists and other professions namely the tendency we all have to find the best students and encourage them to take an intercalated bsc to turn them into the intellectual leaders of the profession when their training is over <e> <s> i hope that the government will give serious consideration to ensuring that we offer minimum impedance to that development among our ablest young men and women in those professions <e> <s> only in that way will our professions be able to hold up their heads with the professions in the states europe japan and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to make a few remarks to the committee <e> <s> i am very grateful to my colleague and friend the noble lord lord adrian for identifying me as someone in the succession started by henry viii in <e> <s> with great respect i say to the minister that it is terribly important that there should be integration between the teaching side and the performing side the national health service and the universities <e>", "<cs> i add my support to the general thrust of the amendment <e> <s> however i should like to say how much i sympathise with the noble baroness lady hooper <e> <s> we have been talking without reference to the present leader of the medical profession in the department of health the chief medical officer of health <e> <s> i assure the noble baroness that whatever may develop on the research side i hope that it will not be to the discomfiture or diminution of the influence of our successive gallant chief medical officers of health <e> <s> i hope that it will be possible for a structure to be designed where these two men women or man and woman are able to work together <e>", "<cs> i wish to join the committees deliberations only briefly <e> <s> a most important person in ensuring the continuity of care when patients are discharged from hospital is the house officer <e> <s> those who have had responsibility for hospital beds particularly those who have had responsibility for the teaching and training of people during their pre-registration year know that there is a kind of house officer who pays enormous attention to the exciting process of admitting the patient to hospital <e> <s> he organises all the investigations considers all the diagnoses and tells elderly consultants such as myself about the latest treatment for the patient <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one observation to the minister before she replies <e> <s> i am sure that this will not be resented in any quarter <e> <s> it is a fact that since the college of physicians and subsequently the other colleges have jealously guarded the standards of professional behaviour in the various professions <e> <s> i hope that the point made by the noble lord lord kilmarnock and by my noble friend about bringing in colleges will be borne strongly in mind by the secretary of state when he considers these matters if only to ensure that we do not have a head-on collision between this chamber and the people who for a long time have been concerned with the maintenance of standards in the health service throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise most sincerely to the noble lord lord hacking for becoming caught up in a most extraordinary traffic jam between bowrings tower in the city and parliament square <e> <s> in my view there was something close to a london coronary thrombosis on the embankment <e> <s> however i am now proud and pleased to be here <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i should like to say that i believe that this kind of fund could be of immense help particularly to the young managers who will have to emerge to help the trusts forward <e> <s> my only concern is whether what i take to be a total of each year will be enough when divided between the total number of hospitals which might apply <e> <s> i should like to support the noble lord lord hunter of newington and his proposals <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendments and to raise a further question <e> <s> it harks back to some pointed and well chosen remarks made recently late at night by the noble baroness lady robson about research being carried out by the medical charities <e> <s> the total number of people under the research umbrella in the direct university central teaching hospitals and in hospitals where university teaching is carried out in the regions is rising and keeping pace with the research demands that are emerging <e> <s> the work is being carried out more and more by young people who are supported by the medical charities <e> <s> as regards the number of clinical teachers who are working for the universities there has been a per cent <e> <s> drop in the resources available to them from the university funding centres <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the noble baroness as she answers the question raised magnificently by the noble earl lord russell <e> <s> we have to be very careful <e> <s> some of the nhs trusts may not be hospitals <e> <s> in east anglia the ambulance service in norwich is anxious to explore the possibility that it should be a trust <e> <s> i hope that that provides some excuse for the omission <e> <s> nevertheless i stand firmly behind my support for this very important amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the committee but i was hoping that i might be able to speak to amendment no <e> <s> a which we seem to have passed over <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> a i deliberately chose to reduce to a minimum the interference with the bill by inserting non-clinical in this way <e> <s> it would mean that the leaders of trust hospitals keep their salary offers in line with those which have been nationally agreed <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord walton for his very able introduction of this clutch of amendments <e>", "<cs> my point is that i believe that trust hospitals will be able to hold trusts and that the district non-trust hospitals will not be able to do so <e> <s> that is something that we need to see resolved because it will tell us whether it is worth while going into a trust hospital to try to raise money for the various things that one may want to do there <e> <s> that i believe is inherent in the notion of a trust hospital <e> <s> as i understand it from my experience in east anglia if one is in a district hospital one is unable to hold any trust moneys in the hospitals own budget and one has to operate from outside <e> <s> that means that one is setting up sub-divisions of all the charitable organisations that are being run centrally by excellent organisations in london <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask one question of the noble baroness before she responds <e> <s> one of the points in the white paper which appealed to many of us was the clear indication that if you took on one of those fund-holding practices and found that it was not to your liking you were able to withdraw <e> <s> i am an ingenue <e> <s> i am not clear whether an escape clause as it were is embodied in the bill or whether the white paper is a kind of umbrella held over the bill part of which people would be able to use if at some time in some cases it might be after one year and in others after a decade they felt that they wanted to withdraw <e> <s> we should be told about that <e> <s> i know doctors who are doubtful about holding budgets but i agree with the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour that some doctors are looking forward to having their own budgets <e>", "<cs> i wish to make a few remarks mainly because i feel that there are many people who are busy doing exactly what members of the committee have been referring to <e> <s> i should not like the record of this debate to pass by without some tribute being paid to the work of such people <e> <s> i shall begin by saying to the noble lord lord young of dartington that my favourite schoolmaster became an hmi inspector <e> <s> i should put my hand in the fire to defend that mans assessment of anything to do with a school or education <e> <s> indeed i should be happy for him to move on to hospitals <e> <s> in my view if the likes of him could be recruited in the professions that is medical nursing laboratory technicians and so on and also the catering side i should be most happy if they were welded together <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord lord kilmarnock to clarify one aspect of the very interesting amendment before the committee <e> <s> each local authority will have to make a social diagnosis of the burden that it is likely to face <e> <s> as i read the amendment and having listened to the debate we appear to be concentrating on the resources available to deal with an unknown problem <e> <s> the amendment states that the secretary of state shall <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make two points <e> <s> the first concerns the word incidence <e> <s> technically low incidence means that something occurs very few times each year <e> <s> incidence is the number of case or categories admitted to a certain diagnosis <e> <s> prevalence tells one the total of people with a particular condition at any time who have to be cared for <e> <s> therefore it may be that the amendment might benefit from a change from the word incidence to prevalence <e> <s> we are dealing here with chronic conditions and it is the chronicity which is reflected in the use of the word prevalence <e> <s> i make no apology for making this short intervention because it is a question which frequently appears in medical exams define the difference between incidence and prevalence <e>", "<cs> i have one point to make <e> <s> i am most concerned that we should appreciate the delicate line which exists between entry and intrusion into the homes of old people <e> <s> we must be most careful when we frame these regulations that we do not give people the impression that if they are receiving domiciliary care their house is an extension of the outpatients department of a hospital <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene to say that hospital social workers have an important role to play in training junior staff in the hospitals about the interface between health and social services <e> <s> one of the things that i greatly regret about the disappearance of the famous lady almoner is that she helped many of us in our formative years to find a way to understand the differences between the approach of the social services and the health services <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may comment about this very interesting amendment <e> <s> i am sympathetic to the philosophy that lies behind it but i ask this question <e> <s> is it right for the rhas to evaluate themselves in the report <e> <s> i have been on rhas on and off since the early s in one area or another <e> <s> apart from a small amount of confidential business at the end of the meeting it is conducted openly in front of the local press <e> <s> it would not be unreasonable to say that the local press is frequently stimulated to give its own evaluation of what a regional health authority has been up to <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her remarks <e> <s> i do not wish to press the amendment at the moment <e> <s> i shall read carefully what she has said but i am not completely convinced by some of the logic she produced when she averred that the trusts would not disturb the smooth distribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am concerned that the bill does not make it difficult for those working for public health officers to secure information for epidemiological studies <e> <s> what intrigues me about the noble lords amendment is the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise simply to say as a relatively new boy how proud i have been to be a member of your lordships house during the debate <e> <s> i congratulate the minister and her colleagues for the manner in which they conducted the business <e> <s> i offer my congratulations too to the opposition on their presentation of important points <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene briefly <e> <s> i promise that i shall try not to keep the noble baroness lady young too long from her evening meal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am honoured to have the opportunity to convey my personal congratula-tions and i am sure those of other noble lords to the noble baroness lady castle on her third maiden speech <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the whips for giving me this opportunity <e> <s> when i was a lowly professor and vice-chancellor in nottingham i received the most courteous and kind reception and help from the noble baroness when she was running the department of health and social security <e> <s> i should like her to know that for many years it is still to be found on my bookshelves her work on the priorities in medicine was a great help to me when i <e>"]
