speech of my noble friend lord swinton and with much of the speech of the noble lord lord mishcon particularly in relation to the advisory committee with reference to which he ended his marvellous

same <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask my noble friend a question <e> <s> one can obtain a bolt-action rifle with a magazine with a capacity for up to cartridges <e> <s> there is a rifle called a tikka <e> <s> there is also the slr which has a limited magazine capacity and fires no quicker than experts can fire it <e> <s> i am left-handed and about years ago on the range i got off over cartridges left-handed with a bolt-action rifle <e> <s> it seems that there is no distinction that can be drawn between a rifle with a magazine and an slr with a magazine <e> <s> to say that the slr is more lethal is not true <e> <s> my noble friend has not given any evidence to prove that that is the case <e> <s> it is simply a bald assertion <e>", "<cs> i also support the amendment because my amendment no <e> <s> is couched in the same terms with the same objective <e> <s> it is phrased slightly differently but it achieves exactly what my noble friend lord wynford has proposed <e> <s> it would be a great pity to deprive the disabled and i think it would be very wrong to do so of a sport in which they can participate and which the prohibition of this weapon would prevent <e>", "<cs> with respect i thought that it was and not as stated in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged <e> <s> i should like to express my support for the amendment but can add very little to what my noble friend lord burton said <e> <s> if these weapons which are part of our national heritage had to be deactivated or in any way changed that would in fact reduce their value <e> <s> that factor should also be taken into account <e> <s> they are part of our heritage and i think that that aspect should be considered by my noble friend the minister <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend can help me on this point <e> <s> the date of which was fixed was not in fact an arbitrary cut-off date there was a reason for it <e> <s> as i understand it in one started to get in america mass production of slrs especially the garand which has an integrated magazine <e> <s> therefore the amendment deals with weapons which were not mass produced but which were specially made probably by special order <e> <s> my understanding was although i may be wrong if i am i am sure my noble friend will tell <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend for explaining the matter so clearly <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to correct my noble friend on one small matter <e> <s> i was not aware that i used the word banned but no doubt <e>", "<cs> there is nothing further i can add <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> not moved <e>", "<cs> i thought i said not moved to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> then thought i heard amendment no <e> <s> called <e>

in view of what the minister and the noble lord lord irvine of lairg have said i should like at this stage to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i accept that explanation <e> <s> i must apologise <e> <s> the noble and learned lord was right with his comment <e> <s> i had overlooked that subsection if i may add that gloss to what he said and be completely honest <e> <s> i can only say more haste less speed <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down one of the difficulties experienced under subsection b is that there are some types of activity which are considered reasonable <e> <s> under the normal drafting principles which i understand if one says that one includes certain types of activity other activities which are not mentioned are excluded unless there are terms saying that the provisions are not exhaustive or someting like that <e> <s> there is a danger in subsection b this is perhaps what is behind the noble ladys amendment that certain activities are not considered reasonable when certain other activities are named as reasonable <e> <s> if my noble friend could give some indication as to whether that could be achieved by a cosmetic change in the drafting i should be interested to hear it <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> it must be made clear that there must not be a limit <e> <s> my amendment no <e> <s> suggests that the number should be left out because the number will in any case be obvious from the description of the guns on the certificate <e> <s> it would be only a small addition to include the three words proposed by my noble friend lord swinton and remove all shadow of doubt that there is no limit <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for his explanation <e> <s> however i still remain most concerned that a person who does not have a certificate is enabled by a person who does have a certificate to get hold of these cartridges <e> <s> it seems to me that the amendment is really in the interest of public safety <e> <s> it also prevents people from being tempted to doing something which they are not entitled to do in the terms in which my noble friend couched his answer <e>", "<cs> i believe that we are and i shall he very happy to deal with them together <e> <s> i beg the committees pardon <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> stands on <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> however it leaves a number of questions that i still find difficult to resolve <e> <s> will the criterion be whether the work is full-time <e> <s> is that what is meant by substantial extent or does substantial extent relate to the financial side of the business <e> <s> those aspects are at the heart of my amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton of shuna found difficulty understanding what lay behind amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i am sorry if they caused more difficulty than the clause they were seeking to improve <e> <s> they were framed as an alternative definition of substantial extent <e> <s> i am left rather unhappy that substantial extent remains and that my noble friend has not accepted my amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and in my name which aim at changing the wording of subsection <e> <s> there are two particular passages that i do not like which i ask my noble friend to consider <e>", "<cs> on what basis does the noble lord lord harris of greenwich draw these conclusions if he has no evidence upon which to make those assertions <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed with that reply <e> <s> my remarks do not appear to have landed on any ground at all <e> <s> i shall deal with the observations of the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> i said in proposing the amendments that a visitor from a country where there was no regime of firearms would have to have recourse to a good referee <e> <s> i thought that the best evidence available of that persons integrity <e> <s> i believe that answers the point <e>", "<cs> the other point my noble friend on the front bench does not seem to have taken on board is that although more is required by this provision in that respect he is right the intention is that the conditions have only to be fulfilled once <e> <s> however the sum of the parts of the provisions of clause will add up over the years to considerably more bureaucratic information <e> <s> it will be constantly repeated without any change <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will reconsider the essence of my amendment before report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> there is one further point that i wish to add to what my noble friend said <e> <s> there is another group of visitors that finds difficulty with the provisions namely persons from overseas who are working in the united kingdom under contract <e> <s> very frequently the contract is for a period of three of four years <e> <s> they are not citizens of the united kingdom and they cannot obtain certificates here <e> <s> very often they are employed by the british branch of an international or overseas company <e> <s> can my noble friend on the front bench explore the possibility of making some arrangements for these people who fall in a rather different category from the visitors about whom we have been speaking for most of this evening <e> <s> in terms of the income tax law they are ordinary residents for that period of time <e>", "<cs> i am having difficulty in understanding the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> the amendment relates to clause in the bill <e> <s> that states very clearly that a person may <e>", "<cs> i bow to the noble lords superior legal knowledge and research <e> <s> he is quite right <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may come back on report and produce an amendment in correct form bowing appropriately to the tortuous and convoluted language of the legal draftsmen which is required to which the noble lord lord morton of shuna drew my attention <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw this amendment and bring it back for consideration on report <e>", "<cs> i beg the pardon of the committee <e> <s> i had better not move that amendment <e> <s> my tackle is in disorder <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed by the response of the front bench to my amendment <e> <s> the car analogy seems to me to be a bad one <e> <s> there are many occasions on which the value of a car goes up <e> <s> that is not taken into consideration <e> <s> another aspect about which i am not clear is the example given by my noble friend lord swansea <e> <s> he said that he had heard of a man who had bought a rifle and spent a lot of money on it thereby making it a better rifle <e> <s> will that person obtain the average price for an average bottom-end model of the rifle that he bought <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support this amendment vigorously and fully <e> <s> i have put down a later amendment in which i have jiggled with the numbers <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton of shuna is quite right <e> <s> it is a pity that we could not have combined them and put in one amendment rather than the other <e>", "<cs> i also support this amendment <e> <s> i think that this is almost a more important <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friend the minister knows exactly what my noble friend lord swinton means when he describes the type of person that he wishes to have on the committee <e> <s> they are people with a good broad outlook and understanding <e> <s> i suspect that my noble friend means that he does not want a lot of technical boffins sitting there scratching their heads and arguing technicalities about muzzle energy and so on <e> <s> there is no difference between what i said earlier and what he now says about competition <e> <s> it is important that the committee should be comprised of people with broad views who enjoy the sport of competition shooting and the use of firearms and shotguns <e>", "<cs> when i tabled the amendment it was necessary to be speculative about what i now discover has been disclosed by my noble friend lord ferrers <e> <s> there was a lack of any provision stating the way in which the committee would be made up it was couched only in the broadest of terms and therefore i felt it necessary to draw that cover in order to discover his intention <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment although i shall not speak to it at length because of the time of night <e> <s> my noble friends remarks appear to have a great deal of sense and for that reason i put my name to the amendment <e> <s> it appears extraordinary that in subsection a only one paragraph c is applied <e> <s> one looks to see what c stands for and it is <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble earl will give way <e> <s> his reference to the principal act is extraordinary because clause makes no reference at all to that <e> <s> it is a homeless persons clause <e> <s> there is no reference to where it is to be found in the principal act <e> <s> we are left in glorious excited expectation of how it is to be fitted into the act <e> <s> i remind my noble friend that the bill is entitled <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> however there are one or two things about which i am not quite clear <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend will be able to help me <e> <s> i am delighted to see in subsection c that this will be done by resolution by means of a statutory instrument <e> <s> if that is the case i wonder why there is provision in subsection d for the code to be admissable in evidence <e> <s> surely once it has been passed by this place and comes into effect by means of a resolution that makes it perfectly good law <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord ferrers for his response <e> <s> i pointed out that there was a right to judicial review against a decision of the home secretary although it is drafted slightly differently <e> <s> in the circumstances and in view <e>", "<cs> i entirely support the amendment <e> <s> my amendment no <e> <s> was couched in much the same form <e> <s> that is why i did not move <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a considerable honour for a young barrister although perhaps not so young in years to follow the distinguished maiden speech of the noble and learned lord lord oliver of aylmerton on a subject that is far from straightforward and is indeed complex <e> <s> his maiden speech has perhaps been a little shy in making its appearance and i hope that it will not be long before we have great pleasure in hearing his contributions to future debates in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with great modesty and considerable temerity that i follow indeed have to follow if i want to speak the speeches of great authority and great distinction that we have heard today <e> <s> i shall concentrate if i may on two aspects of this matter first partnerships and secondly funding <e> <s> partnership has two particular subdivisions one concerning partnerships within the bar itself and the other concerning multi-disciplinary partnerships <e> <s> at first blush it might seem quite attractive to barristers when they look at paragraph of the green paper as to what partnerships could offer but a little consideration would show that to be a false dawn <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with very considerable modesty and a remarkable amount of temerity that having read everything that was said by very eminent and learned members of the house i now rise to make a very small contribution <e> <s> i realise that complexity begets complexity <e> <s> social security measures were always an element of tax that i carefully avoided studying in the detail in which i studied other areas of tax <e> <s> i feel that i am in a large minority of one i cannot make myself smaller <e> <s> it seems to me that it is a very simple matter that is put forward by the government <e> <s> it is as simple as this when it is put into words where the compensation to be paid is that is an easy figure for my limited mathematical capability and where the social security payment which i understand is made fairly promptly for the sake of this example is there is a claim <e> <s> the claim comes from a person who is called the compensator <e> <s> the compensator pays out but only goes to the person who is being compensated the injured person <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to finish what i am saying perhaps he will understand what i am suggesting <e> <s> i started my speech with some deference to him and to what he had contributed <e> <s> however i do not agree with his amendment which was moved in the previous debate <e> <s> i support the governments proposal i do not support the amendment of my noble and if i may say so nearly learned friend lord campbell of alloway who is far senior to me at the bar and is learned in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i said nearly learned <e> <s> i understand the position to be that the main cause of complaint is that the benefit paid from the total compensation is recouped whereas the present offsetting is applied only to special damages <e> <s> that is a term i understand to mean earnings and expenses <e> <s> but it is not applied to the general damages <e> <s> those are the things which one cannot exactly specify <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend for his help on that matter <e> <s> for the reasons i outlined at the outset i support the governments proposal to recover the benefit paid where that benefit is going to exceed on the final compensation the total amount which the person compensated is entitled to receive <e> <s> on that basis i support the government <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may assist the committee <e> <s> i believe that the last two members to be appointed as masters were aged and

lesser judiciary should qualify at years <e> <s> he was partly successful because i understand that my father gave way from to years <e> <s> that was years ago <e> <s> i hope that within the next three months my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor will be able to see whether all the judges lesser and higher can be on the same pension basis <e> <s> if he cannot i shall look forward to
