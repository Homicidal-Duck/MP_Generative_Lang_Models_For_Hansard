["<cs> my lords i am most honoured to be given this opportunity to speak so soon after i have taken my seat <e> <s> yesterday i listened to the gracious speech and was relieved in more senses than one considering my topic that legislation was to be introduced to improve the health and social services <e>", "<cs> my lords it has not surprised me at least that this has been one of the more exciting debates that we have had in this house for some time <e> <s> i think it must be the first time in living memory that there has been a snow shower inside the chamber <e> <s> the amount of emotion indeed is not surprising because we are talking about decisions concerning potential human beings <e> <s> i am not a member of any organised body of opinion about abortion but i think i can speak rationally from a basis of personal professional experience in which i frequently use the provisions of the act <e>", "<cs> speaking also as a member of the medical profession i should like to know from the minister why he disregarded the commissions suggestions and i think it reasonable to spell them out once more <e> <s> the royal commission felt that to abolish the family practitioner committees and merge their administration with the district health authorities would enable those authorities to influence more positively than they can now first the distribution and quality of surgeries and other practice premises some of which are still well below standard as many of your lorships will be aware secondly to create a better balance and relationship between hospital and community care and thirdly to enable the freer movement of staff across institutional boundaries together with the better control and supervision of deputising services <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble baroness i would say that i am really asking for guidance <e> <s> personally i should like to see a situation in which we can work in integration with the district health authority but many of my colleagues have misgivings about this and those are the views that i voiced <e> <s> i am sorry if what i had to say came out in a somewhat disorganised way but i had not prepared my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords the national health service now employs one million people and it is one of the major sectors of government expenditure <e> <s> to keep this very large body of people content would be a major success in its own right but we have to remember that this section of our population is paid in order to help the other million of us achieve health or speedy recovery from illness where possible <e> <s> while we are talking about working conditions of national <e>", "<cs> my lords even though i could he said to be speaking from a professional position i would support this amendment from the point of view of some other people i have spoken to since this bill was first published <e> <s> these are secretaries and members of community health councils and others who are concerned with the smooth running the effective and fair running of the national health service <e> <s> they feel that the proposals for family practitioner committees embodied in this bill are retrograde and they report to me the fact that even now family practitioner committees are not all that easy to communicate with that it is difficult sometimes to achieve co-operation with them with regard to local issues plans and developments such as improved practice premises when required better siting of surgeries for the needs of the people in the area and involvement of general practitioners in community activities of a preventive nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to add my thanks to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for bringing this important subject up for discussion <e> <s> my contribution will be going along somewhat parallel lines to that of the noble lord lord hunter but i think that the two sets of facts we will have produced are complementary rather than repetitive <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships may be surprised that a relatively inexperienced member of this house should choose to speak in a debate of such importance <e> <s> i am not speaking only as an individual with my own views <e> <s> i am a member of the medical profession and i feel that a medical view has as much place in the wider aspects of this debate as for example a view from the church <e> <s> the church quite rightly has a moral view a moral position on the nuclear weapon and nuclear deterrence <e> <s> in this connection it is of great importance that the general synod has voted for no first use <e> <s> it is also very gratifying to me that as reported in the <e>", "<cs> who in strasbourg in may said <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the inclusion of nuclear weapons in that military balance of force was not what he was hoping for <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord carrington that it is absolutely essential that this <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble minister satisfied with the means for ensuring that the quality and quantity of school meals are adequate whether they be merton packed lunches or full meals <e> <s> is he aware that a study by a team from st thomass hospital showed that those who were entitled to receive free school meals were significantly shorter in stature than average and that the study team felt that the withdrawal of school meals might well prejudice their future development <e>", "<cs> my lords there must be very few people in the united kingdom whether they be men or women who approve of the carrying out of this mutilating operation anywhere let alone in this country <e> <s> there is therefore widespread support for the initiative of the noble lord lord kennet in introducing this bill <e> <s> he has described why it is particularly timely <e> <s> i have listened with great interest to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord hunter of newington has been very ingenious or perhaps i should say canny to bring in <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to press the amendment but i should like to say one or two things <e> <s> first of course depression is a medical matter but i wonder whether it is a surgical matter <e> <s> very occasionally lobotomy that is an operation on the brain has been justified as a treatment for severe depression but i am not sure that operations on other <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i was not able to be present at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> i apologise in advance if i repeat some points that have already been made <e> <s> it seems to me that todays debate has been mainly centred on topics related to law and order <e> <s> but this is also the place to raise matters to do with a more expensive edifice than the law <e> <s> i refer to the national health service <e> <s> the speech from the throne contained only a short paragraph on health <e> <s> it stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not keep your lordships long because it is getting late <e> <s> from the moment the news first reached us in early may last year the sinking of the general belgrano has been a very emotive topic <e> <s> some highly charged exchanges have taken place in another place and serious allegations have been made against the government <e> <s> many not only housewives from bristol are not entirely satisfied with the answers to the questions that have been asked <e> <s> it is therefore timely that the matter has now been raised in your lordships house by the noble lord lord hatch <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> in fact if the general belgrano was posing a threat to the task force why was she not sunk when she was actually much nearer to the task force rather than heading away after she had been tailed for hours by the conqueror <e>", "<cs> my lords both the noble lord the minister and his opposite number in another place last week pointed out that even sweden and switzerland neutral nations without nuclear weapons have thought seriously about civil defence <e> <s> however those nations which seem far less likely to suffer nuclear attacks than ourselves seem to take their civil defence a good deal more seriously than we do <e>", "<cs> my lords i must also apologise to my noble friend lord molloy for not being able to be here when he opened this debate as i was speaking in a secular way attending my flock <e> <s> so many noble lords and noble baronesses including the noble countess have made such well thought-out and cogent speeches already tonight that i do not envy the noble baroness who has to reply to this debate <e> <s> many of the points that i wanted to make have already been made very clearly and therefore i shall be as brief as i can <e> <s> for example i will not talk to your lordships about the development of preventive medicine about inner city problems or about the future development of the general practitioner services which have been alluded to by several speakers already <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to congratulate the noble earl lord attlee on his maiden speech which like the utterances of his father was modest but most effective <e> <s> i should like also to add my affectionate tribute to the late lord amulree who was one of my teachers as a medical student and was also a great personal friend of my late uncle who was a colleague of his on the liberal front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether in view of the million which the government are saving through the non-take-up of these benefits some of this money could possibly be used to persuade one-parent families to become two-parent families or for other brilliant ideas which the noble baroness or others may produce <e>", "<cs> it may be of help at this point to describe what is generally thought to be good professional practice with regard to operations of a cosmetic nature on normal human anatomy on mental health grounds such as we are discussing tonight and which comprise the operations which this amendment is supposed to safeguard <e> <s> if a patient requests such an operation because she feels distressed or depressed about the shape of her body and wants it changed surgically the proper procedure is to refer her to a psychiatrist for an opinion about her mental health <e> <s> i am sure this is the opinion of most doctors and i have confirmed that i am backed fully by the ethical committee of the british medical association on this point <e> <s> in the national health service it nearly always the practice that a psychiatric opinion is sought <e> <s> i wish i could say as much for the private sector <e> <s> the psychiatrist may be able to advise more appropriate treatment taking the total interests and background of the patient into account and i think the noble lord lord kennet and other have described how this should be done <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting instructive and i hope useful debate this evening <e> <s> i was pleased to hear from the noble lord the minister that there has been some improvement on the poultry side though i must admit to a certain disappointment over his reply <e> <s> i have a feeling that the government are being somewhat complacent in this area when the actual figures for salmonella infections are going up <e> <s> i do not think that it is quite enough to expect that this debate in this house itself will change matters very much but i can assure the minister that we on these benches will continue to remind the government of the problem from time to time when figures are presented to us <e> <s> it only remains for me to thank all noble lords and the noble baroness who have contributed to this evenings debate and i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord pitt for bringing this subject forward for debate <e> <s> it concerns me professionally just as it does him since i too work in an inner city practice <e> <s> also i am pleased to discover that i agree with practically everything that he said and my approach will be very similar <e> <s> first i think that i should like to try to describe what it is that makes drug taking so attractive to a certain section of the population and why it is such a problem for them to break the habit <e> <s> i shall be referring mainly to heroin addiction which is the most worrying problem as noble lords have said but many of my remarks could be applied to other drugs some also to the problem of drinking and some can even apply to that most addictive of habits the inhalation of tobacco <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not take any responsibility for this lack of clarity in the wording <e> <s> it came back to us in this form after it had been sent to the department for tidying up <e> <s> as there are no further speakers i beg leave to move the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> it was guided through another place largely on the nod i may say by an opposition back-bencher the member for blaydon as a private members bill so it is appropriate for me to do likewise in your lordships house as an opposition back-bencher <e> <s> it is i hope a non-controversial bill <e> <s> it deals with an unusual and some may feel a rather macabre activity namely the anatomical dissection of the bodies of deceased persons for teaching or research purposes <e> <s> this is another reason why it is perhaps appropriate for me to move this second reading since i have in fact as part of my medical training dissected a human body <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness the minister the noble lord lord winstanley and my noble friend lord prys-davies for their contributions <e> <s> i particularly thank the noble baroness for the fuller explanation of the details and purposes of the bill which she gave and with which i fully agree <e> <s> i was also very interested in her historical research which was rather wider than that which i was able to give to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that generic substitution has been practised in hospitals for some years without the objection of any hospital doctors <e> <s> can he give an explanation as to why the same system should not be applied to general practice where the bulk of prescribing takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree as several noble lords have indicated that where personal care is concerned the schumacher principle of small but beautiful often applies <e> <s> more seriously is he aware of recent disquiet that the laid-down procedure for consultation prior to closure is not always adhered to <e> <s> is he able to state that both the informal and the formal stages of this procedure will be strictly followed in the case of any closures that are proposed in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a conference was held yesterday on this important problem at the institute of child health sponsored by all four of the thames regions and that this conference was concerned that insufficient use was being made of existing facilities <e> <s> will the noble lord ensure that his right honourable friend studies the recommendations of this conference which asked for more research and more education of health professionals and the immigrant community <e> <s> this will not be very expensive i assure him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure the noble lord opposite could intervene now if he wishes to speak for just two minutes but i have something to tell your lordships which will take about eight minutes <e> <s> i think the understanding between the pharmaceutical industry and the dhss is a delicately balanced one <e> <s> the national health service pays for per cent <e> <s> of the drugs prescribed in britain <e> <s> surely we ought to be able to say he who pays the piper calls the tune but does he in fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to apologise to the noble lord lord hunter for not being able to be here at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> i would have liked to be able to say that i was detained because of my duties with the mental health care planning team for bloomsbury but that actually meets on a different wednesday <e> <s> i was detained by other professional cares <e> <s> i wish to make only a short statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i strongly sympathise with amendments which attempt to simplify legislation <e> <s> on the face of it here is a three-word definition which is more succinct than the present eight words <e> <s> but in fact the amendment would restrict the right of relatives other than the one person who could be considered the immediate next of kin to object to the donation <e> <s> it could be that a spouse for instance the next of kin might want to donate her husbands body or his wifes body and a brother or sister of the deceased might object <e> <s> under the present wording those objections are respected <e> <s> in fact if any relative objects the donation is refused <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been no easy matter for me to understand this disconnected bill even while wearing my bifocal national health service magnifying glasses which i gather are shortly to become an extinct species <e> <s> i do own another pair with expensive frames <e> <s> i was persuaded to get them against my better judgment an appeal to vanity or something but i have had much more trouble with them <e> <s> the national health service lenses keep falling out of the expensive german frames <e> <s> it is another example of how the public-private mix does not always work <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel privileged to be taking part in this debate in the company of such an illustrious speaker <e> <s> i am also very grateful to the noble lord lord henderson for enabling me to speak on this subject <e> <s> i have spent a vast part of my professional life dealing with the consequences of smoking either investigating the link between smoking and disease and encouraging and helping people to give up smoking or treating those who are suffering from diseases caused by smoking and only too often i find myself supporting and counselling those who find themselves suddenly bereaved because of the smoking habits of their spouses or parents <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> these amendments emphasise in statutory form the need for close co-operation between the newly formed free-standing family practitioner committees should amendment no <e> <s> not be <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a few remarks about amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> concerns screening and it is now fairly well recognised that the best result comes from screening procedures being provided through general practitioner services <e> <s> women are more inclined to respond to a call to have a cervical smear taken or any other procedure that may be thought suitable and particular blood pressure checks if the request comes from their general practitioner <e> <s> also the general practitioner may well make such tests in the course of his normal patient consultations <e>", "<cs> my noble friend can say that again <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that whenever surveys of the work of casualty departments have been carried out it has been shown that between one-third and one-half of the total number of cases seen could more appropriately have been handled in a primal-y care setting <e> <s> does he not feel that the proper <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord winstanley in this amendment and the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> i would go further and say that a nurse should be allowed to do this <e> <s> i do not think that it is the anatomical knowledge that is so important but rather the ethical responsibility that is placed by the public at large in people in the medical and nursing professions <e> <s> if you allow someone to invade the privacy of your body it should be done by a professional group which has been given sanction to do it <e> <s> this is the main reason why it should be restricted to the healing professions <e>", "<cs> my lords should not her majestys government be looking forward to the possible day when fossil fuels become scarce or uneconomic and possibly envisage the day when nuclear power is not regarded as a suitable means of obtaining energy <e> <s> is there not a case for having a working full-scale model in this country such as the one in norway <e> <s> i feel that the answers that have been given so far do not fully clear the points which have been made by my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to a number of arguments which have made an impression on me and i think that the feeling of the house is that the amendment should not be accepted <e> <s> i beg to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not move amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> it has already been spoken to <e>", "<cs> my lords when it was suggested that i might speak in this debate i was at first reluctant since i have had comparatively little first-hand experience of occupational medicine <e> <s> i am a general practitioner who has had a little extra experience in child health and epidemiology at home and abroad in the third world and an involvement in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching <e> <s> but on reading the report the bmas comments and the governments reply i realised as a practising gp that there was plenty that needed to be said even if i restricted myself to the role of the gp in occupational health and i shall not promise to stick to that <e>", "<cs> i have been a fascinated observer of rather than a participant in the several debates we have had in the committee so far <e> <s> sadly unlike most noble lords present i am not a farmer <e> <s> i am however a former lepidopterist and anisopterist <e> <s> if any noble lord does not know what that means i used to be very interested in dragonflies <e> <s> i am also a partaker of and i take a great deal of pleasure in the enjoyment of our special countryside <e> <s> more particularly as a doctor i am interested in the health and welfare of people who live there <e> <s> therefore i wholeheartedly support this amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment i should like to bring up something which the noble lord lord belstead mentioned on several occasions on the previous night when the committee sat <e> <s> this concerned his statement that we in this country do not know what is required in the other countries it is for them to say <e> <s> i submit that in this country there is a greater concentration of expertise in tropical agriculture than exists anywhere else in the world with the possible exception of the acre or so that contains the fao headquarters in rome <e>", "<cs> i should like to say that there is a very close parallel here in the promotion of drugs by pharmaceutical firm representatives to doctors <e> <s> many of us appreciate the visits by these ladies and gentlemen who are always charming and often offer lunches and dinners with alcohol to help persuade us maybe to go down their line of thinking <e> <s> i think the department of health and social security is to be congratulated on keeping us supplied with a continuous flow of information of an independent kind <e> <s> this is just what my noble friend lord melchett has been trying to persuade maff to do for farmers <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour you will be relieved to hear that i am not going to give a discourse on macro-economics but will diverge to a rather more domestic subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to keep your lordships for not more than three minutes i too having heavily chopped what i intended to say <e> <s> for the sake of brevity i shall omit the customary acknowledgements to previous speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to follow the noble lord lord campbell of alloway because he has said that we should each look at the problems that we understand <e> <s> i shall attempt to do that <e> <s> as a general practitioner i have a special responsibility not only to treat my patients to the best of my ability should they be involved in a disaster but also to scrutinise plans for medical care following disasters and to try to make constructive comments on them <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended to start with a few rude remarks about the governments action using such phrases as elected dictatorship or democracy isnt a ballot-box exercise to be indulged in once every four or five years but i think that might he regarded as party political and i think also that the noble lord the minister who is to reply has already had quite enough criticism on that front <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lady jeger for introducing this debate not only because of the national importance of the subject but also i have to confess because it affects my livelihood as i work as a full-time general practitioner in the national health service when i am not in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady cox has performed a very useful and timely service by putting down this unstarred question and we should all be grateful to her for giving such a crystal clear account of the problem <e> <s> we are used to hearing speeches of such quality from the noble baroness and her speech today has been no exception <e>", "<cs> my lords our state of knowledge as to the length of the incubation period is not lacking <e> <s> it is fairly definitely known that it is very variable and can be between six months and six years and that is knowledge which is scientifically backed up <e> <s> it may be anything between those times there is a variable length of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come in again <e> <s> there is some information on this very point <e> <s> i believe that many blood transfusion centres allow donors to state in private whether or not they want their blood to be used i quote for experimental purposes only <e> <s> this is done confidentially so that their partner does not know about it <e>", "<cs> my lords there are just a few more points that i feel should be made but i hope not to keep your lordships more than about five minutes <e> <s> as <e>", "<cs> my lords i can hardly say how much i disagree both with the philosophy and with the facts of the noble lord lord bauer <e> <s> there is one matter that i should like to raise and that is that he seems to feel that public health should only deal with infectious disease <e> <s> more and more public health has to deal with other forms of human suffering whether these be environmental nutritional or due to an ageing degenerating population <e> <s> less and less do we have to deal with the problems of infectious diseases <e>", "<cs> my lords i would only briefly dwell on the measures to deal with the present disaster <e> <s> like other noble lords i wish to speak more about the long-term problem <e> <s> but let me say a few words about the present situation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness give us a few more details as to the progress of the food-labelling recommendations by the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food which she mentioned in her first reply <e>", "<cs> my lords like the right reverend prelate the bishop of bath and wells perhaps i may register my protest against the noble earl lord lauderdale for his calumny against the absolutely magnificent work being done by christian aid throughout the developing world particularly in areas where there are disasters and distress <e> <s> i have seen it with my own eyes and i feel insulted on their behalf <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord reay my namesake with it appears more differences with me than just the y for providing us with this useful opportunity to debate this very important topic <e> <s> but as with the motion of the noble lord lord home of the hirsel yesterday i find myself rather disturbed by the form of words he has used <e> <s> is he not saying in fact ban these weapons or else <e> <s> this is surely a rather subtle form of blackmail suggesting that if the ussr or the usa does not comply with the requirements of the other in the negotiations for banning these weapons we should give up hope of an agreement and initiate or join in another and particularly nasty extension of the arms race <e> <s> i can hear some people saying the russians listen only to arguments backed by strength but to me the concept of arm to disarm is fallacious and has never worked to my knowledge <e> <s> i should be grateful if any noble lord could give me an example from history of where it has worked <e> <s> but let us consider what might happen if nato were to deploy these weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the desirability of getting agreement for a verifiable ban on chemical weapons which i hope the noble lord agrees is desirable will the government think about proposing that nato should perhaps offer to reduce a class of weaponry in which it is superior to the soviet union as a <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble baroness lady cox on her first venture in taking a bill through the house <e> <s> i am sorry on her behalf too that it is such a silly bill <e> <s> it is an unfair bill and i think it is virtually unworkable <e> <s> i am used to agreeing with the noble baroness across the floor of the house on many health issues but on this one i am afraid i have to part company with her and there are health issues involved in the subject with which this bill is concerned <e> <s> i am afraid that it is yet another example of the basically uncaring and undemocratic state that the conservative party has reached today despite some charitable attitudes in the past and its claim to be the party of the family <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly reply to that <e> <s> i do not think that the alternative to corporal punishment need be that cruel or sarcastic punishment of which the noble lord speaks <e> <s> there are other much more constructive ways of controlling the discipline and attitude towards authority of children in school <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that before the last war when we did not know the harmful effect of smoking cigarettes cigarettes a day took per cent <e> <s> of average earnings whereas today when we are fully aware of the harm that cigarette smoking does it takes around per cent <e> <s> of average earnings <e> <s> mindful of this would he not agree that a useful method of reducing cigarette smoking would be to increase the excise duty on cigarettes by a percentage above the inflation rate a year <e> <s> this would have the effect not only of discouraging smoking but also of keeping the very useful exchequer revenue from it at the same level <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why i as an amateur in this complex area of defence strategy have ventured into the debate is my belief which i have stated on at least one previous occasion that war and its prevention can and should be regarded as part of the concern of those such as myself working in the health field <e> <s> nevertheless i feel somewhat humbled to be speaking in the presence of such experts particularly the noble lord lord zuckerman who is to follow me <e> <s> most of us are very unhappy about mad mutually assured deterrence or destruction which is the basis apparently for the <e>", "<cs> my lords my only reason for speaking tonight is to confirm that i still wholeheartedly support the basic purposes of this bill as described by the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> we debated it at great length in both the last two parliamentary sessions <e> <s> the arguments supporting the need for the bill are all in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord pitt and support him for bringing in what i consider to be a long overdue bill <e> <s> i think that all noble lords who have spoken accept that the scientific argument about smoking and health is over <e> <s> i think that perhaps the noble lord lord ka berry might need a refresher course on that <e> <s> although his speech was a great deal more amusing than mine will be i am not sure whether it has helped the case against the bill <e> <s> i shall refer to a number of his arguments at a later stage of my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord looks at <e>", "<cs> since the second reading debate on this bill i have been in touch with a number of people and authorities who are directly concerned with this legislation <e> <s> my remarks like the remarks of most of the speakers so far will be directed generally to all the amendments which are on the marshalled list <e> <s> i have a lot of sympathy with nearly all of them although i was not quite able to follow the reasoning of the noble lord lord coleraine about different treatments for girls of different ages <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should make a small contribution here <e> <s> we have been searching for words <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness allow me to interrupt <e> <s> i do not think that there is likely to be a court case brought against a legitimate <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i have to oppose my noble friend on this amendment because owing to the way in which it is worded there would have to be notified some or so episiotomies and legitimate operations which are done on female genitalia <e> <s> however i should have much more sympathy if it could be narrowed down as in subsection of clause but the amendment as it stands does not do that <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend could think again about that <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage in the debate i think that some of your lordships might welcome a little light relief <e> <s> with regard to social security the government remind me of the traveller on bodmin moor or was it dartmoor <e> <s> who lost his way <e> <s> he asked a local farmer how he could get back on the road to exeter <e> <s> after a pause for thought the farmer said well first of all sir i would not start from here <e> <s> i apologise to those who may already have heard the irish version of this joke but i think that irish people should tell irish jokes about themselves and as an englishman i shall talk about my own country <e> <s> i believe that that tale sums up the governments problem faced as they are with a huge and embarrassing bill with which they would much rather not have to deal <e>", "<cs> my lords like every noble lord or noble baroness who has spoken at any stage of the bill i most strongly support the principle of forbidding this practice which is manifestly cruel and leads to long <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if cigarettes were to be put on the market now for the first time supposing that there had not been a habit over the last two centuries it is extremely unlikely using current toxicological techniques that they would be granted a product licence <e> <s> in view of that can he not see that from now on each year there is a progressive tightening-up of the voluntary agreement with the industry and i join with my noble friend lord ennals in expressing pleasure that a new agreement is about to be worked out towards the day when all forms of tobacco promotion will be finally phased out <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord consider that the atomic energy authority establishment at harwell is the best agent through which to channel research funding and the evaluation of renewable energy projects <e> <s> would not the science and engineering research council be a more appropriate body considering the possible competing nature of renewable energy and atomic energy <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord has read the report which comes from the energy technology support unit of the department of energy <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord read this report which comes from the atomic energy authority <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that there has been a considerable improvement in treatment for breast cancer recently <e> <s> i can give evidence of patients who are surviving very well using anti-oestrogen treatment <e> <s> will the noble baroness see to it that her right honourable friend makes sure he anticipates that the committee will recommend more funding and be prepared for that as part of the inevitable increase in health service expenditure which is necessary as new technology is developed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness let the house know whether in matters like this which affect tobacco sales and advertising the government are influenced at

in pensions which would otherwise have been paid to the people who die every year from smoking-related diseases <e>", "<cs> my lords in this short but important debate which has been initiated by my noble friend lord brockways unstarred question i should like to be thought of as speaking as a doctor and talking about preventive medicine <e> <s> the malady that concerns us is too disastrous and overwhelming to respond to treatment even palliative measures after a nuclear explosion would be pitifully inadequate <e> <s> most physicians who have really considered this problem and have not just defensively avoided thinking it through realise that the only ethical stance is to back every possible move to defuse or reverse the nuclear arms race <e> <s> political activity may not be part of normal medical practice but we may be forced into it sometimes by matters of conscience and in parenthesis i may say that that does not apply only to nuclear issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter so much as the thrower of a lifebelt to aid the noble minister in her reply but rather as a terrier who has been set to bite the heels of one or two other noble lords and the right reverend prelate who have criticised her speech <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord at one point at least barked at the noble baroness when he threw at her something of a nasty about compensation for vaccine damage <e> <s> i too should like to know the answer to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord mottistone for introducing the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply which was i must say predictable and rather disappointing <e> <s> is she aware that many of the members of this organisation the ippnw are critical of the human rights record of the soviet union <e> <s> is she not aware nevertheless that this does not stop them supporting the main aims of this organisation which is single-targeted upon the prevention of nuclear weapon build-up <e> <s> is she aware that the members of this organisation as health professionals who are responsible for the care of individuals and communities feel that they should act on that first dictum of health care namely that prevention is better than cure especially when there is no cure for the effects of nuclear war <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness know of the remark attributed to andrei sakharov himself which is that when any rational being finds himself on <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the authors of the excellent all-party report which we are discussing this evening <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord walston for his very clear summary of its findings and recommendations <e> <s> our topic this evening as many noble lords have pointed out concerns a major part of what is perhaps the most important unsolved problem in the world today how the first and we hope one day the second world can help the third to get on to its feet <e> <s> our colonial legacy is still very much with us and there is much evidence that we are now exploiting our colonies more effectively and at less cost than when we maintained garrisons and administrations in africa <e> <s> it is in this context that we should look at our aid programme <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that a recent survey which was commissioned by the dhss showed that per cent <e> <s> of schoolchildren aged to thought that cigarette advertising was allowed and was being shown on television <e> <s> is she further aware that the rate of cigarette smoking in - to year-olds is shown to have gone up by per cent in the past two years <e> <s> in view of this will the government take steps to enforce the legislative provisions that are supposed to prohibit the advertising of cigarettes on television which regularly circumvents this legislation by means of sports sponsorship <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not agree that the meningitis epidemic in stroud has revealed the gross inadequacy of the whole system of infectious disease notification in the country <e> <s> would she suggest that the department sets up an internal inquiry as to methods of improving infectious disease notification <e> <s> at the moment is she aware that it depends on <e>", "<cs> will she listen to my words and perhaps pass the message to her right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that in norway which is one of the countries where cigarette advertising has been banned the cigarette smoking habits of teenagers have declined which is the reverse of what is happening in this country <e> <s> will she not take the opportunity of the renewal with the tobacco companies of the agreement on sponsorship to rectify this situation of illegal television advertising that is going on at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness please look at the figures which are available in that case <e>", "<cs> my lords when talking about a delicate topic such as teenage sexuality and its problems we should not forget that most young women today become sexually mature much earlier than we realise at some point between and years of age <e> <s> the better nourished and more healthy children in fact are and ours in this country are very healthy and well nourished the more towards the lower end of that age span they tend to mature <e> <s> the average age of puberty in girls now is whereas two or three generations ago it was nearer <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should all be very grateful to my noble friend lord jenkins for raising this highly important and relevant matter <e> <s> i am the first to admit that i am not well versed in legal matters but the topic is of such basic importance that i felt that a medical input could be justified <e> <s> i am extremely surprised and sorry that we do not have on the list of speakers any noble and learned lord for i think we could have had a very useful input from the legal profession <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand i am the last speaker before the closing speeches and on the last evening before the recess i shall try to be brief <e> <s> i am supporting my noble friend because i am acutely aware as a general practitioner of the great problem which the multi-handicapped have to face and the burden which they impose on their families and all those responsible for their care <e>", "<cs> my lords as the last speaker before the concluding speeches i should like to thank my noble friend lord wells-pestell for giving us the opportunity to put forward some of the less happy aspects or results of government policy <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness who is to reply will not feel that this debate has been entirely in an attacking vein <e> <s> many speakers have put forward solutions and i hope that the government will take note of them <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to the noble lord lord henderson for raising this very important matter and for his explanation of why it is particularly relevant today <e> <s> it is a vast topic <e> <s> in fact just one segment of this topic the prevention of mental handicap is being discussed at the royal society of medicine in two weeks time <e> <s> that is a two-day conference with papers by acknowledged experts on the subject and it is only one facet of the whole problem of disability <e>", "<cs> my lords while we all very pleased that the funding of voluntary agencies has increased in this way is it not the case that the total budget for aid overseas has actually decreased by some per cent <e> <s> over the past six years <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister say what the governments position will be at the meeting of the nato defence ministers later this week on whether or not a force goal should be agreed <e> <s> before it can permit the production of this new generation of chemical weapons the united states congress has to see that the force goal has been agreed by the nato nations <e>", "<cs> my lords i have arrived just in ti me to support the noble baroness opposite on this amendment <e> <s> i feel that it is the least we can do <e> <s> i am sure that she has already pointed out the really important need to have someone to cope with emergencies in order to avoid possible tragedies <e> <s> but there are also quite practical reasons for having a trained person on the premises <e> <s> for one thing it saves doctor time both in hospitals and in general practice and it also saves teacher time <e> <s> it saves teacher time because if there is no trained person on the premises a teacher may have to take a pupil to hospital or to a doctors surgery instead of being able to cope with the problem on the premises <e>", "<cs> my lords as a medical practitioner who does not always agree with the official line of the british medical association i should like to support most fully this small but necessary bill of my noble friend <e> <s> on a point of information i should like to explain that this curious name skoal bandits might appear to be extremely attractive to children <e> <s> in school parlance now the word wicked and a bandit is nothing if not wicked means something new exciting and to be admired <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should all be grateful to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for bringing forward for discussion this important document which as he says affects us all <e> <s> at some time in our lives we all make use of the services of pharmacists <e> <s> i am personally grateful to him because it is not the first time that he has actually encouraged me to read properly an important report such at this instead of just skimping the reading which i would otherwise have done <e> <s> it is a very welcome addition to the discussion on primary care which is much in the news at the moment with the governments recent publication of their long awaited green paper actually it is now a blue paper entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to back up his request to have those questions answered at the end of the debate and if they are not perhaps the noble baroness will pass them on to the minister <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat disappointed that as a dentist the noble baroness does not support this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord seebohm said and other noble lords have implied if the cash gets into the hands of the children they are very likely to buy their own meals and not spend it on school meals <e> <s> we shall have a chance later when we are talking about school meals to look more deeply at the survey which has been mentioned by my noble friend lady ewart-biggs but which other noble lords have not quoted <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise that i was not able to be present for the first part of the debate because of a previous engagement <e> <s> i want to concentrate on the important topic of chemical weapons which has been mentioned by several noble lords and is mentioned in the defence white paper <e> <s> the question really is escalation or elimination <e> <s> to me it is a matter of concern that these unpleasant weapons have become topical again <e> <s> there was a generation that had experience of them in the front lines of the great war the war <e> <s> both sides on the western front had the terrible experience of chlorine phosgene and mustard gas wafting over and into their trenches <e> <s> sometimes the wind changed and own gases rather than own goals were scored <e> <s> the russians without means of retaliation suffered severely on the eastern front in that war <e> <s> it is worth mentioning that the nerve gases now available are far more lethal than was world war i gas <e> <s> i could give sickening medical details but i will spare your lordships <e>", "<cs> i think it would be perfectly possible for me to make a speech of second reading length on the health implications of clause but i shall try to compress into a few minutes the matter which would fill out that speech <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that renewable sources of energy would be free from this particular problem <e> <s> is he further aware that there has been widespread criticism of the governments reduction in funding for resarch and development of wave power which is potentially a huge source of energy particularly on the atlantic coast off scotland <e> <s> does he not think that the government should change their policy on this matter and perhaps put a little more money into this promising development <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a few remarks in continuing the debate about whether mothers will be responsible in finding the money for their childrens school meals <e> <s> during the passage of this bill through the house i have spoken to a number of experienced teachers school secretaries school supervisors and managers <e> <s> with one voice they declare that money paid to mothers of children who now receive school meals is quite unlikely to be given to the children to pay for school meals <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that there is increasing scientific evidence showing that good nutrition in infancy and childhood is the basis for good mental and physical health in later life <e> <s> in view of that would the government consider reintroducing nutritional standards for school meals which they abolished in <e> <s> also would they at this late stage consider removing from the social security bill those aspects of it which further damage the school meals service <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that sir douglas black described this bill as mr fowlers diet for disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady macleod asked whether gps should not be paid for women who are screened between the ages of and <e> <s> this age group is now showing an increase of a particularly nasty form of cervical cancer <e> <s> if it is thought that doctors should be paid for screening women over why should they not be paid for screening women under <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble baroness could clarify that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has chosen one of the most important topics in the modern world today <e> <s> she should be congratulated on that <e> <s> she is right to link the problems of rapid population growth in the developing world with the problem of excessive child and maternity mortality <e> <s> i have been interested in this topic for a number of years <e> <s> last year i was fortunate enough to be the united kingdom observer at a ipu-who conference in thailand on health and development <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware i am sure she is that there is increasing evidence from the united states that the early stages of coronary heart disease are being found increasingly in children and adolescents <e> <s> does she not agree that this has important nutritional implications <e> <s> bearing that in mind will the government reconsider their decision to abolish nutritional standards for school meals particularly now that coronary heart disease appears to be affecting more than it used to do the less well-off sections of our community <e>", "<cs> my lords the question which my noble friend has raised has been discussed at great length by professionals from a number of disciplines including legal experts <e> <s> we have heard a notable contribution from one of the most eminent of these <e> <s> also lay people representing the general public have thought deeply about these matters <e> <s> as has been mentioned there is a campaign for freedom of information which has produced a draft bill on this subject <e> <s> i have not been at the forefront of these discussions but i feel qualified to speak in support of my noble friends question because i am a member of a profession that probably makes and holds records about more people than any other <e> <s> almost everybody has a general practitioner and some sort of note is usually made at each consultation <e> <s> about million consultations occur with gps every year <e> <s> the records of some patients contain long and detailed letters and reports to and from specialists giving in-depth assessments of a particularly personal nature <e> <s> the notes of hospital patients are sometimes even more complex and often impossibly bulky <e> <s> sensitive information of a similar kind is also held in the files of social service and education departments housing authorities and other bodies and professions which deal with people and their problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall add only a few remarks in support of my noble friend lord brockway <e> <s> as some noble lords may know just before christmas i visited chile a country as the noble lord lord hatch has pointed out with scarcely the best human rights record in the world <e> <s> i saw and heard evidence that arbitrary arrest incommunicado confinement and torture are alive and well in that country <e> <s> i should like briefly to describe an experience with a moral which i had when i visited valparaiso the main port and naval base of chile <e> <s> it is a fascinating place with a ring of very steep hills covered with precariously perched shanty dwellings above the port area <e> <s> the main avenue has royal palms purple jacaranda trees and a statue of admiral lord cochrane who with british government approval assisted the chileans to gain independence in the s <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting that i find myself talking after the noble lord lord bauer when we are considering the less fortunate in this country just as i followed him when we were talking about the less fortunate people in the third world a few months ago <e> <s> in both cases i could not disagree more with his views and in this particular case i have the benefit of working as a general practitioner among some of the very needy people whom he thinks perhaps should not receive the benefits to which they are entitled and to which parliament feels they are entitled <e>", "<cs> the analogy is there because the noble lord makes out that in both cases the aid is counter-productive and diminishes peoples own efforts <e> <s> i fundamentally disagree with him on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords would the governments case in resisting the tax be strengthened by pointing out the important health implications which would come from increasing the price of these fats and oils <e> <s> is the minister aware that a large number of these oils are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids which are protective against heart diseases and that their increased consumption was recommended by coma the committee on medical aspects of food policy three years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that many people in chile who are working towards the return of democratic institutions there were deeply disappointed when they read of the british governments vote in this case <e>", "<cs> i should like to add one or two words in support of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mcgregor <e> <s> noble lords may be interested to know that i raised the question of this amendment with my group practice team at lunchtime today <e> <s> the group includes doctors health visitors and social workers <e> <s> they all felt that these young mothers should be entitled to receive the grant themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to express as a fellow professional how much i agree with all that he has said and how much i admire the way in which he has said it <e> <s> the whole profession will be behind him on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for not being here at the beginning of the debate and therefore missing the speech of the noble lord lord home of the hirsel and the maiden speech of the noble and gallant lord lord bramall <e> <s> as a member of the select committee of your lordships house i was visiting the medical research councils clinical research centre <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first place there has never been any proof that they were helping the el salvadorian guerrillas and in the second place the policy of intervention by supporting the contras in nicaragua did not start until after the reagan administration came in <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise what a very important international role is played by both the clinics and the institute <e> <s> i have had some very useful professional collaboration with the tavistock clinic the tavi as we all know it and the work that has been done there for years <e> <s> i also have friends who work in australia new zealand japan and other countries who have trained there <e> <s> does the minister feel that the work done there is of such importance that the problem about its future should be settled quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to spend about five minutes talking about the state of the nations health and about five minutes on the direction in which i feel that the national health service should be moving in order to cope with our major problems <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord mentioned my name at the beginning of his speech perhaps i may hark back to a debate we had some two years ago about aids <e> <s> if he looks at <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to say that like all other noble lords except the noble lord lord young of dartington who has made some very good points i support this short but very useful bill <e> <s> i also confirm that it has the backing of the bma <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am most grateful to the noble earl lord lauderdale for choosing this subject <e> <s> it will always be of crucial importance and should be and is debated frequently in both houses <e> <s> in fact there is seldom a day in which one or more aspects of energy policy or energy production are not discussed in the quality newspapers <e> <s> however i find myself a little out of step with the position of the noble earl and the very words in the title of the debate cheap and abundant i think that both need to be scrutinised quite carefully <e> <s> i should like to substitute two other words harmless and clean or perhaps your lordships would prefer the phrase environmentally harmonious <e>", "<cs> my lords i am limited by time and therefore i shall concentrate on the particular aspect which i see from the point of view of a general practitioner with an interest in child health working at clinical level in a national health service group practice in a health centre with very much a team approach to the problem <e> <s> i am not talking about the administrative teams who talk about things i am talking about the teams who actually do things on the ground <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support the amendment <e> <s> i have my name down among those who have tabled it <e> <s> very briefly it is a logical amendment <e> <s> it is consequential if one can have an amendment to one bill on an amendment which has been made to another act <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether that is the correct wording because i am legally illiterate <e> <s> but if it is thought necessary in an extreme case to undertake an intimate body search the amendment does not prohibit it in any way <e> <s> it just makes it more difficult for it to be done indiscriminately <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very tempted to go down the path of the noble lord lord colwyn and have a discussion with him about preventive medicine and the persistence of much ill-health in our society today but i shall have to reserve that to a discussion with the noble lord afterwards because i have so little time at my disposal to talk about complementary medicine <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should also like to congratulate the noble viscount particularly on his remarkable sense of timing <e> <s> the report of the noble baronesss working party was published today and she has given us a very good if brief resume of its most important findings <e> <s> moreover the consensus statement of all the medical and surgical colleges of the united kingdom was released on th november <e> <s> that statement made clear recommendations on reducing the damage caused by alcohol <e>", "<cs> i could bandy words about the sum involved but this is not the right place to do so <e> <s> i am encouraged by the noble lords words and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i refer the noble earl back to the question of own-brand lagers being only alcohol-free lagers <e> <s> would it not greatly assist the police in their valuable work of controlling soccer violence if only alcohol-free lager were permitted under own-brand labels <e> <s> surely that is something which the government could do without great difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say something which may not be relevant in this case <e> <s> does the minister know that mr patel is putting no charge on public funds since like his member of parliament he obtains his medical care through the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise in advance for the fact that i shall not be able to stay until the end of the debate owing to my contractual obligations to the national health service <e> <s> i feel it might be useful to your lordships if i attempt to amplify in some degree the basis of the experimental work on human pre-embryos which other noble lords have already described <e> <s> it is a complex field to understand especially for non-biologists <e> <s> i must say that i am impressed by the grasp of the subject which speakers so far have shown <e> <s> much better explanations than i can give are available and i particularly recommend the article by dr anne mclaren director of the medical research councils mammalian development unit in the <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord actually asks me to reveal an extremely personal part of my life i can say that the noble lord is completely wrong <e> <s> also it is possible for couples whether heterosexual or homosexual to be extremely discreet about their sexual relationships <e> <s> how many noble lords here have actually seen their parents indulging in a sexual act or knew even until they were perhaps adolescent what they did in bed together <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been quite an experience to hear such powerful voices from such a powerful industry raised against the amendment through their spokesmen in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i think i must have misunderstood the vehemence with which he was defending the industry and that is why i suggested that form of support <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i am the seventh health professional to take part in the debate this afternoon and the third professional practising in the national health service <e> <s> therefore we are seeing very much a coalface or face to face picture particularly when one remembers that the rest of those who have spoken are on the other side and are customers of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i personally have found this report fascinating reading <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble and learned lord lord brightman and his committee on producing such a valuable document <e> <s> i have to say that i shall unfortunately have to leave the house before the minister replies because i have a full surgery of patients booked to see me and it starts at this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that we are saying to women thou shalt have that child taken away <e> <s> that is not the case at all <e> <s> it is entirely up to the woman concerned whether or not she wishes to continue with her diagnosed handicapped fetus <e>", "<cs> i should briefly like to support the amendment <e> <s> amendment no due to be debated shortly is the amendment of my noble friend lord pitt of hampstead so perhaps this is not quite the right moment to try to amalgamate the two amendments <e> <s> the wording is definitely an improvement on the language in the bill because it draws our attention to the need to co-operate with each other whether in a school in a local community or with people in distant parts of the globe <e> <s> it takes into account the social aspects of the environment and the people in the world as well as the physical aspects which the noble lord lord craigton wanted to tackle in his amendment <e> <s> the amendment is slightly superior although i should like to encompass all the sentiments which the noble lord put forward when he moved his amendment <e> <s> as it stands it rightly enjoys the support of at least one bishop who is not with us tonight the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester and one very notable cleric my noble friend lord soper who has just spoken <e> <s> it is eminently christian in spirit but at the same time it encompasses members of all other religions and those people with no religion <e>", "<cs> i support both the amendments and speak briefly in support of the amendment no <e> <s> tabled by the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> i am aware that the science working group has already gone a long way towards constructing the core curriculum for science and is now examining many suggestions some of which include the topics in the amendment <e> <s> the groups provisional curriculum already includes some of the topics which are under the headings of life skills and health education <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the decision of nato to improve its nuclear capacity was in answer to soviet modernisation of its nuclear arms and if so what is the evidence for that suggestion <e> <s> alternatively was that decision as another noble lord has suggested intended from a position of strength to encourage the warsaw pact to come up with a new proposal for a balanced reduction of conventional weapons or short and medium-range nuclear weapons <e> <s> if so would it not be cheaper and considerably safer for our side to make new proposals at geneva for such balanced reductions without going to the expense of modernising our weapons as is proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer which was reasonably helpful and i should like to ask him a supplementary question <e> <s> there are severe drought conditions in fact there is a situation of impending famine in parts of nicaragua due to the combined effects of drought and the disruption of agriculture because of the war <e> <s> can he say whether the government intend to reply to nicaraguas recent request to them for bilateral aid of an emergency nature to the tune of less than million to help fund the supply of oil and beans <e>", "<cs> my lords is it necessary for there to be a pre-existing bilateral agreement before aid is given in response to an emergency request for aid because of severe famine conditions <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to my amendment no <e> <s> a which seeks to remove compulsory assessment from year-olds which is the first key stage <e> <s> in this amendment i am putting forward not only my own view and that of many primary school teachers i have met i meet quite a few in my work as a general practitioner but also the views of the <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to press the amendment but i must say that that answer will give rise to a great sense of disappointment among all those who are providing this very valuable service in inner london at the moment <e> <s> we shall scrutinise the noble earls every word in <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that all is not well in community care for the mentally disabled has been made clear in the speeches we have heard <e> <s> even the minister admitted this when he said that the government were not complacent which may be a way of saying that they are actually quite worried <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak extremely briefly as a member of the profession most concerned in the bill <e> <s> the bill will be very helpful and i fully support it <e> <s> here i am speaking not only for myself but for the british medical association which i understand has been working on the bill with the original sponsor in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very interesting how much agreement there is between the working professionals in health on both sides of the chamber on quite a number of issues which we discuss in your lordships house <e> <s> i must apologise to the noble lord the minister for arriving rather late it was for the same reason as was given by the noble lord lord colwyn <e> <s> i may have missed some of the points he made and if that becomes clear from my speech i apologise in advance <e>", "<cs> my lords as a co-opted member of your lordships committee i should like to express how privilged i felt to meet so many distinguished witnesses and to visit some of the worlds most prestigious research establishments <e> <s> i had the good fortune to be among the small sub-group of the committee which spent a very action packed and brilliantly organised nine days visiting both the west and east coast of the united states <e> <s> for all these experiences as many other members of the committee have mentioned we owe a debt not only to our two expert advisers and our indefatigable chairman but also to our dedicated secretariat and tireless clerk to whose literary skills we must owe some of the clarity of the report <e>",

mentioned states in the appendix <e>", "<cs> i wish to give a little preliminary background before i ask the question <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the appendix of the consultation document states <e>", "<cs> with regard to the contention of the noble lord lord trafford that this is inappropriately placed surely it is parliamentary practice when there is a matter of considerable concern for it to be raised and placed into a bill which is relevant as a whole and which is passing through either another place or this chamber <e> <s> for instance who would have thought that a local government bill would be the place for a hotly contentious issue such as the promotion of homosexuality <e> <s> it does not in the first place seem to be appropriate that homosexuality and local government are necessarily connected <e>", "<cs> i do not have any strong feelings about the amendment <e> <s> once while i was in the united states i benefited when i left my glasses on top of my car and drove off <e> <s> i was able to buy a new pair over the counter <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord winstanley can answer my question <e> <s> many of the conditions which are detected by the screening by opticians occur at the ages when presbyopia appears <e> <s> if someone has developing glaucoma or macular degeneration when presbyopia is also developing and he buys spectacles over the counter he will experience a degree of improvement in his vision <e> <s> will that not put him off going for the treatment which the early condition needs <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord winstanley says that it was an absurd situation for the nurse to tell him what she wanted so that he could write out the prescription <e> <s> it still is an absurdity <e> <s> it is still happening <e> <s> the amendment would be much welcomed by many workers in primary health care as well as in hospital <e> <s> i fully support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord is aware of the most important and internationally recognised work that has been carried out by this unit in delineating and defining the large proportion of work which reaches general practitioners which is of psychogenic or social origin although it often masquerades first as physical illness <e> <s> if the medical research council takes over the bulk of the funding can he say whether the expertise of that team will be maintained <e> <s> further will the new units be situated appropriately as this one is at the institute of psychiatry <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i am the only member of your lordships house who is likely to be affected personally by this clause since i still have years to go before reaching the age of <e> <s> that figure is not mentioned in the bill but apparently is the age at which it is understood that general practitioners will be required to retire <e> <s> yet the provision will not affect me in fact because i intend to retire long before i attain that age <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to put forward another point to back up the argument of the noble lord lord mottistone which is that it is not simply road traffic accidents which are more likely to occur but that there is also a serious health problem that might be involved if free eye tests are not continued <e> <s> for example let us suppose that someone has an early glaucoma or an early diabetic retinopathy but also some presbyopia <e> <s> he will find at about the age of or when he buys his over-the-counter glasses that his vision is somewhat improved but perhaps not as much as it should be <e> <s> if the test is to cost he will delay getting the test and the glaucoma or diabetic retinopathy may well advance to a greater extent than it would if there was not the deterrent <e> <s> therefore i very strongly support the point that the two amendments from the committee go together as a pair <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the house will think that it is appropriate that the voice of a practising general practitioner as well as that of a practising dentist should be heard in the debate particularly as it is about eyes and not teeth <e> <s> some of my remarks will follow the arguments which convinced your lordships to vote for the original amendment at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister throw any light on the rather persistent feeling among veterinary surgeons that there are plans for the closure of one or more of the six veterinary colleges <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness please tell us where this hazardous material is and whether it comes under category n or p <e> <s> then we can keep well clear of it <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will be relieved to hear that i do not intend to make a speech but more a point <e> <s> i am sorry if i am repeating what has been said by several noble lords <e> <s> however i think it is sufficiently important to bear some reinforcement <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should regard this debate introduced so ably by my noble friend lord carter as a continuation of the debate that we had in may which was introduced by my noble friend lord basnett <e> <s> as the right reverend prelate the bishop of southwark said the fact that we have had two debates in the same year is an indication of the importance of the topic <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to regulate the hours worked by junior hospital doctors <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness remember that we held a debate in this house in january nearly five years ago in which the subject of salmonellosis in man and animals was discussed <e> <s> her noble friend the leader of the house will doubtless remember rather better than she does since he answered in the debate <e> <s> in that debate a number of us suggested that controls for protein feedstuffs one of the main problems in salmonellosis in poultry should be tightened up <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i should like to say how delighted i am that so many distinguished noble lords have agreed to take part in the debate <e> <s> i am particularly pleased that my opening batsman will be the noble lord lord butterfield with his maiden speech <e> <s> as we all know he has just retired from his <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to thank all noble lords who have spoken and who have stayed so very late <e> <s> i have found the contributions from all sides to be of great interest and i should particularly like to thank the noble lord lord butterfield for his very supportive though of course completely non-controversial maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl lord halsbury and the noble lord lord gisborough for voicing the doubts and difficulties of a number of general practitioners at the sharp end <e> <s> i have heard many of these worries myself and can echo them from my own experience <e>", "<cs> my lords before moving the motion on the order paper i owe the house an explanation for not being in my place when the motion was called yesterday <e> <s> as the order of business had recently been changed at about pm <e> <s> i took what i thought was the wise precaution of telephoning that usually reliable source of information the government whips office to check when i was likely to be called <e> <s> i was told that it would be after the second reading of the security service bill at about pm <e> <s> when i arrived at about pm and was told that i had been called about an hour previously one might say that my chagrin was considerable <e> <s> that apart i should like to say how grateful i am to the noble lord the leader of the house for making space for this brief item of business today <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to make a speech but to ask the minister a series of questions which fall under two headings <e> <s> the first concerns chickenfeed the second concerns food labelling <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that this bill be read a third time i should like to say a few brief words before sending it on the next stage of its journey <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to apologise to the noble lord for not congratulating him in my opening speech <e> <s> i am sure that we shall be meeting a lot across the floor of the house <e> <s> i also thank him for his words <e> <s> the useful meeting with the bma on the rd of this month might not have been quite so constructive had this bill not been currently passing through parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow such an excellent and constructive speech as we have heard from the noble lord lord hankey <e> <s> i particularly welcome his emphasis on the need to create an after-care network and to strengthen it and also to quintuple the number of community psychiatric nurses because they are absolutely fundamental <e> <s> i very much congratulate the noble lord lord mottistone on introducing this worthy and very well intentioned bill <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not think it essential for the major and controversial proposals in the white paper to be first tested by carefully evaluated pilot studies to see whether they work <e> <s> does he not further agree that the proposals of your lordships select committee on priorities in medical research among which was the proposal to set up a national health service research authority would provide precisely the basis for undertaking such studies <e> <s> can the minister say when her majestys government will give a full and considered reply to the select committees report <e>", "<cs> my lords i found this to be a most excellent report <e> <s> it maintains the high standard that we expect from our select committee on science and technology <e> <s> i feel unqualified to enter the debate as i was not a member of the committee <e> <s> i cannot begin <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear it and i think that the kind of remarks that have gone into the report may have accelerated that process <e> <s> some of the mechanisms of transfer from animals to man of the diseases which still remain on the list are not fully understood and badly need more research <e> <s> therefore i fully support recommendation no <e> <s> which states <e>", "<cs> the amendment stands in my name also and i support the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> the minister said that he believed that the bill would be taken as one of a number of models in drawing up recommendations and possibly legislation to include the care of the chronically mentally ill <e> <s> i believe that if this amendment is incorporated in the bill that will make it an all the more useful a guide in the way he suggests particularly when the government are still considering their response to the griffiths report <e> <s> i believe that the short and direct recommendations in this amendment would be very useful and i certainly would like to support it <e>", "<cs> in my speech at second reading i also pointed out the view of a practising gp of how difficult it was sometimes to define precisely when a schizophrenic is schizophrenic or suffering from some other mental disorder <e> <s> i follow the reasoning of my noble friend in supporting his opposition to this clause <e> <s> i can explain to the noble lord lord winstanley why i supported an amendment in a clause which i apparently wished to abolish <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> it simply provides an opportunity to speak about this matter <e> <s> i believe that we would run into a good deal of trouble if we were simply to look at the problems of those with the label of schizophrenia and leave out of account all the other people with many other serious mental disorders who are in equal difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm or deny the accuracy of information that i have received to the effect that the resource management initiative in wales alone will cost million which is the sum that he said the government were allowing for the project for the whole country <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer which was very much what i had been expecting <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the proposed solution put forward by the developers which involves driving six piles extremely close to the foundations of the theatre through unexcavated areas gives rise to great concern among archaeologists working on the site and all those who have specialised knowledge of the site <e> <s> is he aware that there are other solutions which would involve less damage and which would not unduly delay development such as the scheme suggested by ove arup commissioned by the theatres trust <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to clarify one point <e> <s> is the minister aware that the piles that are to be driven very close to the theatre will go through <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that your lordships select committee which examined the research needs of the health service received convincing evidence that if expenditure on health service research currently running at per cent <e> <s> of nhs expenditure were to be increased to per cent <e> <s> improvements in efficiency and effectiveness could be achieved which would vastly outweigh the cost of that research <e> <s> does he realise i am sure that he does that many industrial concerns think that to per cent <e> <s> of turnover is a reasonable amount to spend on research and development <e> <s> does that not back up the suggestion of the noble lord lord nelson that an eminent and widely respected scientist should be appointed to the management executive of the nhs <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully agree with the noble lord lord hunter that there is a place for a greatly enhanced role for primary care in the next decade and beyond <e> <s> the governments plans as laid out in the white paper and the revised contract do not exactly make the imagination soar when thinking about the real needs of our steadily ageing population <e> <s> in fact i think they are largely irrelevant <e> <s> however it is clear that the government have grasped the pivotal role of the general practitioner service in the functioning of the national health service <e> <s> in a sense this is a great compliment to general practice <e> <s> as the noble lord lord hunter said to years ago general practice was in a pretty moribund state <e> <s> its recovery is very much to the credit of the royal college of general practitioners with its insistence on raising standards and making training for general practice obligatory <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that the real price of cigarettes and alcohol has gone up by or per cent <e> <s> over a period of years <e> <s> the real income of people generally has gone up by at least that percentage if not more <e> <s> therefore the price in relation to income has not gone up rather if anything it has gone down <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the select committee mentioned in the question made the recommendation that any major changes proposed in the national health service should be preceded by scientifically evaluated pilot studies <e> <s> is she also aware that the select committee of your lordships house which reported months ago on medical research made widespread recommendations on how research and development in the national health service should be carried out and increased from its present lamentably low level <e> <s> can she tell us when the government will reply to that report <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting my noble friends motion i feel that i can claim to represent both general practitioners and their patients <e> <s> everyone is a patient at some time <e> <s> the subject therefore concerns everyone <e> <s> i ask first whether these regulations will improve the well-being of patients and secondly whether they will help the professions which are involved in working towards that end <e> <s> although the changes are intended to benefit patients the overall package may prove to be very unpopular <e>", "<cs> my lords at a post graduate meeting of general practitioners last month i was asked if as a peer i felt i had a constituency <e> <s> having a general practitioners surgery every day i said i was rather relieved not to have a constituency surgery as well <e> <s> in fact it is surprising how similar the problems are which are brought to both types of surgery <e> <s> i do feel that i have got a constituency both in my profession and even more among my patients in a wider sense among all patients or potential patients <e> <s> from their point of view there is much that is relevant in at least four of the bills which will come before the house this parliamentary session <e> <s> there is also much which would help them to avoid becoming patients through the maintenance of good health which i submit is missing in the governments programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble viscount lord brentford for bringing to our attention the difficulties faced by the families of junior hospital doctors <e> <s> as one who has been through that stage and whose son and wife are going through that stage at the moment i can fully testify to those difficulties <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccoll in his maiden speech mentioned the great difficulties in the careers of junior doctors and the stresses put upon their family life <e> <s> i am pleased to be able further to put this point on record and to bring to the attention of noble lords that we are continuing to follow this problem to see whether we can improve the situation for junior doctors and their families <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to mention that junior government ministers are a much rarer breed <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome certainly the stated intentions of the bill <e> <s> however i think it is worth looking at the underlying reasons why today in an affluent society when so much is understood about man and his environment we have this problem of an increasing incidence of food-transmitted disease as many noble lords have pointed out <e>", "<cs> my lords in following the noble lord lord avebury i feel in somewhat of a difficulty because he has expressed so well nearly all the points that i had meant to make <e> <s> i should like to emphasise one of the last points that he made <e> <s> if the khmer rouge make further progress there will be a flow of refugees into vietnam and the economic situation there will become worse <e> <s> there are at the moment something in the region of so-called economic refugees in hong kong and we appear in the eyes of the world to be extremely unpopular in suggesting that they be forcibly repatriated <e> <s> the problem will be a lot worse if the khmer rouge step up their activities inside cambodia <e>", "<cs> my lords would not a sensible approach to this problem be for the government to attempt to work out a package with the vietnamese government so that they will be able to accept back their citizens in return for economic aid which will help to alleviate the very economic conditions which caused the boat people to leave vietnam in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords my colleague the noble lord lord hunter is quite right to emphasise in the wording of this motion that despite publication of the national health service and community care bill there are still far too many uncertainties facing the national health service <e> <s> i should like to talk about the distant future and the plans that we should like to implement in the long term but so great are the worries immediately concerned with the forthcoming legislation that i shall concentrate on a few points within it <e> <s> first i want to have a quick look at the gp contract <e> <s> i shall then speak about fund-holding practices gp budget holders and how hospitals opt to become independent trusts <e> <s> finally i shall say a few words about medical research within the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness gets into her final straight will she answer my query <e> <s> will fund-holding practices be able to buy services from private hospitals with the funds which have been supplied to them through the nhs <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the ipu-sponsored delegation of parliamentarians from britain who were allowed a fleeting visit to east timor in march this year i ask one or two quick supplementary questions or perhaps one <e> <s> is the minister aware that the delegation was supposed to meet bishop belo the head of the catholic church in east timor but that when we arrived he was not available for us to visit <e> <s> is he concerned for the safety of bishop belo who is sometimes outspoken in his criticism of the indonesian authorities with regard to human rights particularly in view of the violent dispersal of a group of supporters outside his house on th november this year <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment because it is relevant to my amendment no <e> <s> which asks for the word health that implies nutritional claims to be specifically mentioned in the bill <e> <s> if i understand it correctly i may be wrong the offences specified in clause would be committed by contravention of the regulations allowed in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i was only stung into putting my name down for this debate yesterday when i saw that no other health professional was speaking <e> <s> i am not a health economist but i think that a view from within the national health sevice is appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him a question <e> <s> if i heard him correctly he said that if medical treatment fails or per cent <e> <s> of patients can have their condition put right by an osteopath <e> <s> i should like him to give me the address of his osteopath as a number of my patients would be extremely grateful for that <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> her words reassure me to some extent <e> <s> i shall have to scrutinise them more carefully when i see <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government working towards the replacement of the representation at the united nations of cambodia by the coalition government which is dominated by the khmer rouge by representatives of the hen sun government which is now universally recognised to be the <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will put me right <e> <s> as i read it if clause c were removed as is called for in this amendment it would put the mixing of gametes with the live gametes of another species of animal totally outside the control of the licensing authority <e> <s> in fact it would remove it altogether from the control of this bill and make it freely available <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first answer one of the points made by the noble baroness with regard to development of effective methods of contraception which might be useful in the third world <e> <s> there is no question of our forcing that contraception in a paternalistic way upon the people of the third world <e> <s> the methods being developed may be more useful and most easy to use in countries where there are no widespread medical facilties <e> <s> that is why they may well be chosen as suitable for use by medical and other people in those countries if they should wish to use them <e> <s> there is no quesion of our forcing it upon them <e>", "<cs> there is no question of those products being used only in third world countries they have also been extremely useful in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords as a cyclist who this morning was practically thrown off his bicycle three times on the way to the house because of inadequately filled holes in the road can the minister tell me whether he has any powers even of persuasion to insist that the undertakers who make holes in the road fill them up adequately and level with the rest of the road <e>", "<cs> my lords i also apologise for not putting my name down to speak <e> <s> i had thought that this unstarred question would be discussed at a later time when i would be unable to take part in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree <e> <s> i would not wish to go down that line <e>", "<cs> i should like to re-emphasise the point made by the noble lord lord houghton that this would actually delay the abortion so that a woman who wanted to have her abortion at say weeks might find it takes her a week or so more to find three doctors <e> <s> she would then be in a more dangerous situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer but is she not aware that the increase that has been awarded for next year represents a per cent <e> <s> increase on the current years funding <e> <s> however that is short of what is required to meet nationally agreed pay scale increases <e> <s> does not the noble baroness agree that it will be inappropriate with the current accent on community care for the mentally ill for the hospital which is the leading training school for psychiatric nurses to have to reduce its intake of nurse trainees <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that her colleague the minister of state for health mrs virginia bottomley today visited the maudsley hospital <e> <s> will she make sure that the minister is made fully aware of the concern of everyone who has spoken in the house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> it echoes some of the remarks made by the noble lord lord butterfield on second reading by other noble lords during the committee stage and by the <e>", "<cs> my lords in support of this amendment i should like to remind the house that a number of speakers supported this or similar amendments during all three previous stages of the bill <e> <s> not only will there be a deterrent in the bill as it now stands to those taking longer courses but also after they have finished the longer courses there will be an incentive for them to go into the more highly paid branches of their profession and perhaps neglect the lower paid ones <e> <s> in my own field of medicine i think of medical research public health and epidemiology which are rather poorly paid branches of the profession <e> <s> they are however extremely important <e>", "<cs> my lords will her majestys government back up as much as they can the action of the united states <e> <s> it is now

able to impose its will on nations in central america <e> <s> i hope that in this case her majestys government will be encouraged to do the right thing and see that the rule of law rather than military force prevails in guatemala <e>", "<cs> my lords at this point two-thirds of the way through the debate i shall not attempt to give a comprehensive second reading speech on the bill <e> <s> i can remember no bill on which i have had more wide-ranging well-informed and urgent briefings <e> <s> like the noble lord lord winstanley i think that this is two bills wrapped into one <e> <s> in the time available to me i cannot pay adequate attention to the community care aspects of the bill when there is so much to say about the national health service proposals but that does not mean that the community care aspects are unimportant <e> <s> far from it properly organised and financed community care will make a profound difference to the effectiveness and costs of the national health service

rate of schizophrenia among the or so homeless people in bloomsbury is so high that it has been estimated that they would represent a caseload to mental health services more appropriate to a population of <e> <s> the population of bloomsbury is only <e> <s> is she also aware that this problem is not restricted to bloomsbury <e>", "<cs> my lords by now almost everything that can be said has been said <e> <s> as a practising gp who lives in inner london i am acutely aware of all the problems referred to by noble lords <e> <s> i wish to concentrate on transport and on a particular form

discussion about purchasers and providers the director of public health through his particular discipline is the best informed person in a particular community as to the needs of that community <e>

know whether he would have time to serve also on the fhsa but it would be nice to think that he could also be a member of that authority <e>", "<cs> despite the ministers words i do not think that

is very important and i strongly support it <e>", "<cs> as a gp representative on a working group which has been trying to draw up the district plans for discharge from hospital i support the amendment <e> <s> in answer to the noble lord lord jenkin i agree that there must be joint planning between local authority and hospital <e> <s> but how does the local authority know when a patient will arrive <e> <s> the initiative must be taken by the hospital in order to alert the local authority and the general practitioners about when the patient is being discharged <e> <s> it must take the first step and therefore the district health authority should have a duty to do that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccoll paints a cosy picture of how the health authorities will sit down with the local gps and have a chat to decide <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> as a practising medical practitioner under the national health service i take advantage of the postgraduate courses which are available <e> <s> there will be a new system whereby under the new contract for general practitioners they have to pay for the courses that they attend and they will be given money if they go to a sufficient number of courses <e> <s> that is an incentive under the new gp contract <e> <s> that still does not mean that health authorities do not have to put in a considerable amount of funds to provide the range of courses that are necessary for all grades of medical personnel nurses and dentists some of whom do not have the arrangement of paying and being reimbursed <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> i work in a district which a few years ago did not have a consultant in urodynamics and did not have a continence adviser who is a specially trained nurse <e> <s> when a clinic began to operate it was very much appreciated by many of my patients <e> <s> it is not the people with spinal injuries who make up the greatest number it is very often older people or those who have suffered strokes <e> <s> the clinic has made a tremendous difference to the lives and the dignity of the lives of a number of people in my practice <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make an analogy with the education service and schools which opt out <e> <s> the three bodies concerned are the school governors who can be taken as equivalent to the management of a hospital the staff of a school who can be considered as equivalent to hospital staff and the parents who can be considered the equivalent of the patients <e>", "<cs> the amendment is similar to the

costly as the fund holding exercise <e> <s> i believe that those methods should be developed made available tested and evaluated now before the fund-holding practice goes ahead <e>", "<cs> i should like to mention this point of single expensive drugs taking up the cost of the total drugs bill <e> <s> information we have received through the pact system which i mentioned earlier gives an example of one expensive growth hormone drug <e> <s> the cost of that drug is perhaps equivalent to that of zidovudine <e> <s> the prescribing costs for one doctor with patients increased by per cent <e> <s> because of that one drug <e>", "<cs> i agree that the way the amendment is worded minimises the emotional difficulty of asking relatives for permission <e> <s> the committee might be interested to

practitioner <e> <s> they would rather go directly as the noble baroness said perhaps to a facility outside the immediate neighbourhood although a number will use the facilities within their own neighbourhood without having been referred by their local gp <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i am not alone among practising doctors in very often being caught out when trying to estimate how long a patient with a terminal illness has to live <e> <s> a minority of people seem able to keep the grim reaper at bay for far longer than expected whereas others are not so lucky and are carried off by a sweep of the scythe unexpectedly quickly <e> <s> there are often more of those than there are of the others <e> <s> i sometimes find that if patients are told that they have only a very short time to live or as in the words of the bill death is expected within six months they will turn their faces to the wall and give up hope <e>", "<cs> my lords i support fully my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i have only one question about the amendment in relation to subsection which states that subsection shall cease to have effect after st march <e> <s> in other words the measures embodied in the amendment will cease to apply after that date <e>", "<cs> my lords i too shall be very brief <e> <s> as another medical member of your lordships house i want to endorse my noble friend lord waltons approval of the bill <e> <s> i also applaud most warmly both of the maiden speeches that we have had the pleasure of hearing <e> <s> they have fulfilled the criterion of being non-controversial but have by no means lost bite humour or wisdom in fulfilling that criterion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have joined the debate on the amendment at so late a stage <e> <s> things moved rather faster than i had expected <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak from personal experience <e> <s> on about three occasions during my professional lifetime i have had to invoke section of the national assistance act <e> <s> it was an extremely difficult performance requiring the permission of a justice of the peace and the medical officer for environmental health <e> <s> often those people are not available in the middle of the night when a crisis arises <e>", "<cs> my lords the reverse would occur <e> <s> lower salaries are often paid in the areas in which there is the greatest need <e> <s> independent trusts are likely to be set up in the most attractive areas where perhaps the pay would be higher <e> <s> i do not believe that the point made by the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes is valid <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a few remarks that will take half a minute <e> <s> i make no bones about the fact that i am deeply unhappy about the bill <e> <s> there would have been widespread acceptance by those working in the national health service of many of the proposed changes if one or two regions or an equivalent number of districts had been chosen as pilot zones as proposed in an amendment <e> <s> in that situation the changes could have been fully and scientifically evaluated without a commitment to press ahead willy-nilly with those changes <e> <s> in effect the government have been forced to agree to a radical introduction of the changes because the data and the physical means of implementing them are not yet in place <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the supplementary question of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in which he suggested that the charter was a prescription for higher inflation and unemployment can the minister say what the inflation and unemployment rates are in those countries which have accepted the principles of the charter <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will be pleased to know that as i have listened to the debate i have gradually scratched out more and more of my speech as my points have been progressively and better made by other speakers <e> <s> it has been most interesting but not unexpected to hear so many noble lords and some noble baronesses tell us not to be lulled into a sense of false security as does the review by events in the ussr and in eastern europe <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us what representations her majestys government are making to the thai government who by allowing arms to reach the khmer rouge and acting as host to them in camps on the cambodian border are playing a crucial role in prolonging the conflict <e> <s> can he say how that government defends this position now that the vietnamese have withdrawn their forces from cambodia <e>", "<cs> my lords do her majestys government intend to open a consulate in leningrad which has a great deal of contact with britain <e> <s> is the minister aware that other nations have consulates there <e> <s> is it true as i have been told as patron of the britain/ussr medical exchange programme that no member of the consular staff in moscow speaks russian <e> <s> do the government intend to remedy that position <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that poverty is strongly associated with rapid population growth in developing countries <e> <s> that is tied up with womens education <e> <s> poor countries cannot incor-porate family planning into their health services <e> <s> poor people cannot purchase contraceptive supplies <e> <s> does the noble earl agree that the debt burden affecting most third world countries is one of the most important causes of world poverty <e> <s> can he give us a progress report on what her majestys government are doing to alleviate the debt burden in the third world <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have contributed to this discussion <e> <s> i cannot say that i am delighted with the reply that the minister gave <e> <s> i had hoped he might make one or two remarks to show that he recognised that the points i made were important <e> <s> i agree that the bill provides a framework for the regulation of advertising but there is no indication that things will be any better than they are now <e> <s> things may in fact become a lot worse <e> <s> there will be many more channels and a great many more advertisements before our eyes and before our childrens eyes <e> <s> we must watch this space <e> <s> however i can see that at the moment i am not likely to have enough support to carry the amendments <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be appropriate if i say a few words as a practising doctor <e> <s> the movers of the amendments may feel that that qualification diminishes the worth of my contribution <e> <s> however i hope that noble lords who have not made up their minds will accept that individual doctors and the great majority of the profession as a whole as well as most obstetricians and gynaecologists feel that the commons amendments are entirely appropriate <e> <s> they modernise the abortion act and bring the law into line with current practice in most cases <e> <s> they will remove the anomaly of the infant life preservation act under which gynaecologists operating in good faith risk prosecution for carrying out a humane procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say what proportion of our gross domestic product the aid figures that he gave us represent <e> <s> can he say how soon this country will attain anywhere near the level of per cent <e> <s> of gnp which was recommended by the united nations <e>"]
