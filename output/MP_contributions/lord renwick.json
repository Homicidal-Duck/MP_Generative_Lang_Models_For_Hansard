["<cs> my lords i should like even in her absence to add my congratulations to those of other noble lords to the noble baroness lady lane-fox and to take up one or two points that she made in a very interesting speech <e> <s> i have not known her as long as the noble earl lord swinton with whom i agreed on one matter which has slightly thrown me <e> <s> i now come to my noble friend the minister and her statement about clause <e> <s> this is a point that puzzled him and i shall leave it for the moment and allow my noble friend to take it up in her winding up <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to start on this subject at this late hour but my noble friend the minister has made a point about parents rights <e> <s> i feel that i must support this amendment as i supported amendment no <e> <s> on confidentiality not purely on the grounds of parents rights but purely on the grounds that there seems to me some hesitation by my noble friend in making local education authorities totally accountable for the service that they provide for these children and handicapped children at that <e> <s> i have not heard the word accountability mentioned before this evening i may have missed it but i feel that these are two very important amendments which we are now speaking to as indeed was amendment no <e> <s> and i hope that the minister will give this due consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to my noble friend lord buxton for bringing up this subject in the house today <e> <s> many noble lords may rather wonder why i put down my name to speak <e> <s> for some years going back in fact before the falklands war i have been privileged to meet my noble friend lord buxton and the noble lord lord shackleton on the subject of the south west atlantic though i am afraid i have probably never been south of spain <e> <s> but it is mostly on strategic issues and the problems that government have at various times in taking decisions that affect our properties interests and responsibilities world-wide that i wanted to make a very short and fairly simple contribution to the debate <e> <s> i hope that it will be seen as such <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of jobs is my noble friend aware that when the glc set up the <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me enormous pleasure to follow the noble lord lord addington following a maiden speech which as i think your lordships will agree expressed very well what the rest of us were going to try and say i would suggest rather less eloquently <e> <s> i believe that he found that the medium in which he was happiest was in making an oral contribution <e> <s> i suggest he remembers that because many of us i believe hope to hear a lot more from him in the future <e> <s> i also took note of his mention and i am not quite sure that i heard him aright of some low esteem <e> <s> i say here and now that he should forget from his own point of view any feeling of low esteem <e> <s> he has a great deal to be proud of and delivered his maiden speech very well indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord chalfont for bringing up this subject <e> <s> i make no apologies for taking one or two minutes to mention my past history because i had experience some time ago when my father was chairman of an independent television company <e> <s> i had some opportunity then of talking to the senior directors and executives of that company on the formation the running and the birth of independent television news <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to add my congratulations to the noble viscount lord weir in his absence for a maiden speech of remarkable quality <e> <s> i am sure that we shall hear more from him in the future <e> <s> i thank my noble friend lord beloff for an opportunity to air not exactly my expertise but at least my enthusiasm for this subject <e> <s> i was almost brought up with the generation of electricity <e> <s> my grandfather built barking power station <e> <s> my father ran it and developed a private utility company or group of companies which supplied most of london and i think about two-thirds of the southern counties with electricity up until and nationalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord shackleton for giving us this opportunity to discuss uk space policy <e> <s> as the tenth speaker on the list i find that much of what i intended to say has already been superseded by the speeches of other noble lords <e> <s> most particularly i felt an enormous sympathy with the words of the noble lord lord williams of elvel who spoke from the front bench opposite and who spoke much more eloquently than i can <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try my best to put my few points as fast as possible <e> <s> in offering a general welcome to the education reform bill i should like to support the minister on the importance of improving standards for all children and also standards for students in further and higher education <e> <s> included in those children and students however are many with special education needs <e> <s> it is on their particular difficulties that i wish to address the house in relation to this bill <e>", "<cs> i too should like to add my support to the amendment tabled in the name of my noble friend lord burton on the basis that the bill as a whole will involve a great deal of work for the authorities <e> <s> therefore if we can exclude such weapons which are of a certain age and are most unlikely to be used in a situation such as the one which i believe caused this firearms amendment bill to be put forward i am sure that the minister will look sympathetically at this amendment and the following one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for much of what she has said <e> <s> i shall have to read the detail in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the city of london spitalfields market bill is promoted by the corporation of london who are the owners of the land comprising the spitalfields wholesale fruit and vegetable market and the market authority <e> <s> the purpose of the bill is to provide the corporation with powers to relocate the market and there are some consequential provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his words which were not exactly of support but they at least raised no objection and for considering the planning issues which i do not believe are part of the corporations promotion of this bill <e> <s> however i am grateful to him for his words <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that <e> <s> therefore in representing them in moving the second reading that is also a matter that should not be further discussed by me <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend the minister for his comments most of which follow what he said at second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be the first speaker to thank the noble lord lord tordoff for the opportunity to debate the subject because it is of the utmost importance <e> <s> london has a tremendous future and a wonderful past but it is being strangled to death <e> <s> the through-ways of london are important not only to the people who live here but also to those who work here and transport goods <e> <s> in real terms the cost of the delays in londons traffic are quantifiable and i do not believe that today they have been too accented <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to the noble lord lord shepherd for the opportunity to discuss the subject <e> <s> i felt that another member of his committee should speak in the debate <e> <s> however having put my name down and observed that no other member of the committee had i looked into the subject and then realised why <e>"]
