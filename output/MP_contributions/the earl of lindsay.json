["<cs> my lords it is not without considerable trepidation that i rise to address your lordships for the first time chiefly i feel as it becomes progressively more difficult so to do the longer one has taken to bring it about <e> <s> i assure your lordships that this has not been caused by my own procrastination but is due to having the bulk of my business interests outside london namely in the united states and canada <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble viscount on the aptness of his remarks on smaller houses in his excellent maiden speech and thank him for his other observations <e> <s> as other noble lords have shown the one major obstacle to assured preservation is the necessary funding <e> <s> if that is there the problem is eased <e> <s> one obvious path to increasing the generation of cash is the overseas visitor route <e>", "<cs> my lords i crave the indulgence of the house on the occasion of my first address to your lordships <e> <s> i very much welcome the opportunity which this debate has provided <e> <s> being based in scotland but with a landscape practice which is available nationally i cannot help but take a great interest in regional and national transport policies of both of which i frequently feel either a beneficiary or a victim <e> <s> as with many of your lordships i am well aware of the trials and tribulations which can be afflicted on todays growing number of travellers <e> <s> there are times when the only possible source of comfort is the attitude that it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive unless of course everyone in the tailback is a travel author for whom the slower the journey the richer her the experience <e>"]
