["<cs> my lords my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and i had a long political association in another place <e> <s> he was always very patient and bravely bore my many shortcomings <e> <s> when he was translated to your lordships house i begged him in the words of the psalmist <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure for me to follow the noble lord lord brooks of tremorfa <e> <s> i should like to add my gratitude to his to the noble earl lord listowel for not only initiating the debate but giving me the chance to assure him that even very new peers are well aware of the service that he has rendered to your lordships house in the past and are also aware of the work that he did in various parts of the commonwealth during the two decades that followed the last war <e> <s> scientists although not always entirely unanimous are at least in agreement that the planet on which we are now making our temporary home has existed for quite a long time <e> <s> i believe that it is generally thought to have existed between three billion years and five billion years <e> <s> they also agree i understand that human beings have made their own appearance on this planet comparatively recently <e> <s> i fancy that the historians of the future are probably going to add that over the few centuries during which the actions of individuals or of collections of individuals have had an impact on the <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say in cases where pit closures become necessary and it seems to be agreed on all sides that there have been many such cases in the past and there will no doubt be a number in the future what possibilities of employment exist in other pits in the country and what assistance financial or otherwise might be available to miners who want to take advantage of such employment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble baroness a little further about my noble friends question <e> <s> while the improvident mother is changing her mind and going back to weekly payments i think my noble friend wanted to know who would pick up the bits <e> <s> i should certainly like to know that too <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i may be allowed to express my congratulations to the two noble lords who have made their maiden speeches this afternoon <e> <s> having heard them both on many occasions in another place i was delighted to find that their translation in no way diminished their skill <e> <s> having suffered recently from great trepidation on a similar occasion i was deeply envious of the fearless competence of the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> with regard to the noble lord lord bishopston for whom i have long had great admiration i am sure that the house greatly welcomed his desire and intention to speak without losing more than a few hours following his introduction and hoped that we shall not have to wait very long before we hear him again <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the gratitude which has already been expressed to the noble lord lord kennet for bringing to your lordships house a subject which i entirely agree with him is of enormous importance and i share the gratitude which has also been expressed to him for the powerful case which he has presented for action in relation to the plans for development which are being considered by us this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords if i said then i apologise because i do not always speak as clearly as i ought to speak <e> <s> that clear commitment is my second reason and in view of the particular question which the noble lord is now asking the government it is one of immense importance in our whole consideration of this matter <e> <s> but to my mind and perhaps also in the mind of the noble lord lord kennet the most important reason is the recent report of the local ombudsman <e> <s> if such a report is to be totally ignored one begins to fail to see the point of this expensive and elaborate procedure set up by parliament <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady birk rightly said this was the whole point of the procedure <e> <s> in my own experience government departments to give them their due credit used to pay close attention to critical reports from the parliamentary commissioner and they would have been in deep parliamentary trouble if they had failed to pay such reports close attention <e> <s> but if the report which we are discussing tonight is to be set so lightly aside i cannot see it other than fatally weakening the authority of the ombudsman on future occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i want briefly to support that part of the case of the noble lord lord evans of claughton which related to electoral reform in local government <e> <s> in doing so i am sorry but not wholly surprised to find myself in conflict with my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i too like the right reverend prelate should like to express deep gratitude to the noble lord lord oram both for the content of his speech and for providing another occasion for us to discuss this very important matter <e> <s> many of your lordships are to speak in this debate and i hope i shall not abuse the privilege i have this afternoon of speaking early <e> <s> i also hope your lordships will forgive me if it so happens that i have to leave before the end of the debate tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to speak following the noble lord lord houghton who i have felt in the or years i have known him defies the laws of nature as he grows older his energy gets greater <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my gratitude to the noble earl lord attlee for his first speech to your lordships <e> <s> as one who had a very great admiration and also affection for his father it did not surprise me to hear from him an understanding and a <e>", "<cs> my lords not surprisingly even at this early stage of the debate some of the compelling arguments which i had prepared for your lordships have already been laid before you <e> <s> in view of the fact that the list of speakers is still long and the hour is late i shall do my best to be unusually brief <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady david noble lords and the right reverend prelate the bishop of lincoln for having taken part in the debate and made very constructive suggestions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to follow the noble lord lord sherfield with whom when he was chairman of the atomic energy authority i had many interesting discussions on a number of occasions which i hope he also remembers <e> <s> i should like to share <e>", "<cs> it is true as the noble lord lord walston says that the subject of frontier controls <e>", "<cs> so far as bats are concerned i was surprised to learn that the construction of the tunnel would not necessarily afford a means of travel particularly acceptable to bats because they have already been known to fly to kent from the pas de calais over the sea <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to clarify the matter i should be grateful if my noble friend would confirm that many more of these facilities exist on the continent that in britain <e> <s> that is my first point <e> <s> secondly would he also confirm that the criteria for establishing an inland clearance depot in this country are much more stringent than is required on the other side of the channel <e> <s> lastly can he say yes or no and i think the answer will be yes that at the moment facilities exist in the case of a number of individual manufacturers <e> <s> should the answers to those questions be in the affirmative whether or not the amendment is the right way to achieve it can he give us an assurance that arrangements will be made to prevent the flow of vital traffic being impeded <e> <s> i think the minister will agree with me that that is one of the main objects and principles of the whole tunnel system <e>", "<cs> my lords i share some of the anxieties expressed by the noble lord lord ampthill and earlier by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> it was the unanimous view of the select committee that this person in charge of safety matters on our behalf should he independent of the government <e> <s> i may say and i think that our select committee report makes this quite clear that we all had a deep admiration and respect for major rose but it was only because he was not in a position of complete independence of the government that we expressed the view that we did <e>", "<cs> my lords the importance of the debate is that it concerns our commitment to nato <e> <s> while many of the reserve forces will be committed to nato a number of them that are not so committed will play an indispensable role in the defence of britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that a humble address be presented to her majesty as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys energy seems each year to grow greater <e> <s> apart from visits to canada and iceland we hear that she plans to cross the world again to visit new zealand <e> <s> all of us would like to wish her godspeed but i think her majesty will understand that there are many of her subjects in this island perhaps particularly in the principality of wales who would be very glad of a short respite from new zealanders at the end of the football season not that the principality need be the least discouraged by temporary setbacks <e> <s> however i do not think it ever will be <e> <s> victory will come <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the remarkable features of this debate so far is its unanimity <e> <s> i became increasingly interested in electoral reform before i became a member of the hansard society commission on electoral reform under the chairmanship of my noble friend lord blake <e> <s> as he pointed out the commission did not in fact espouse the system of a single transferable vote but it chose the system allowing the co-option of certain additional members which was naturally strongly opposed and has been ever since by all who are convinced that elected members should be attached to a territorial constituency <e>", "<cs> i wish to take issue with the noble lord lord stoddart who claims certain democratic credits for the present system of first-past-the-post <e> <s> i expressed my view earlier to noble lords <e> <s> i said that it was very difficult to claim democratic credit for a system which denied any representation to a party winning one in four of the votes cast <e> <s> therefore i was delighted to hea about the move which the noble lord lord underbill has made from what i thought i hope rightly was the comparatively resistant position which he seemed to suggest when we debated this bill at second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i am not too late to add my congratulations to the two maiden speakers to whom we have had the pleasure of listening this afternoon <e> <s> i was particularly glad to hear the speech of my noble friend lord inglewood <e> <s> although it makes me feel even more ancient than usual it reminded me of the close working relationship which i used to enjoy with his father <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear more from him and at greater length <e> <s> i was just enjoying his speech when he sat down <e>", "<cs> my lords all noble lords who have so far addressed themselves to the crisis in the gulf in this debate have not surprisingly concurred about its gravity <e> <s> some but by no means all have agreed with the conclusions which were expressed clearly and forcibly by both my noble friend lord caithness and the noble lord lord cledwyn at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> but there has been general agreement this was a point stressed particularly by my noble friend lord pym that on no occasion in the years since san francisco has united nations opinion been nearly so unanimous as in its sanctions policy of the present day <e>"]
