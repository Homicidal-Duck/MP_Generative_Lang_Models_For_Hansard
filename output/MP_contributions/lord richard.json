["<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful for the opportunity to take part in this debate <e> <s> i am delighted to follow the noble baroness lady elles and i am delighted to see too that she has lost none of the determination vigour and enthusiasm that she had when she presided over the affairs of that somewhat unruly body the european parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will know that the defence review is the subject of intense speculation in the press and elsewhere <e> <s> can he give us any idea when the government will be in a position to announce their conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the minister a little more on a point that i put to him on an earlier question on the order paper <e> <s> of course defence reviews are exacting <e> <s> of course they have to be undertaken <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we accept that defence reviews are exacting <e> <s> is he further aware that we accept that matters have to be gone into in great detail <e> <s> but can he not be just a little more forthcoming on this point <e> <s> a good many people are dependent on decisions which the government are to make <e> <s> can he say whether the defence review will be completed in a matter of weeks or months or will we have to wait for years for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that somewhat predictable reply <e> <s> i am sure he is aware that the government have consistently emphasised their commitment to the social dimension <e> <s> if they are against the social charter can the minister tell us what initiatives in the social sphere they are prepared to make and support <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister told us that his right honourable friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs had discussed those matters last week with both the greek and turkish foreign ministers <e> <s> can he tell us what effect the discussions had and what response he received from them <e> <s> does he foresee any reasonable chance of renewing the inter-communal talks at a fairly early date <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from what the minister said that the five permanent members of the security council have now agreed on the composition of the supreme national council <e> <s> the house will know and i am sure the minister will agree that this is crucial to a settlement <e> <s> however can he tell us what part the khmer rouge is to play in the supreme national council <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> i have listened to this part of the debate and apologise for not having been here since the start this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government satisfied with those figures <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government satisfied with those figures <e>", "<cs> my lords no one who has listened to this debate so far can fail to have been impressed at the seriousness with which the house is approaching what on any view of the matter is an extraordinarily grave situation <e> <s> nor can anyone fail to be impressed at the degree of agreement that there is between both sides of the house on how to approach this matter at least at this stage and no one certainly could underestimate the seriousness of what has happened in the middle east since the beginning of august <e> <s> the overt aggression by iraq the acquisition by force of a neighbouring country the menace of further aggression into saudi arabia the threatened use of <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the greatest threat to the solidarity of those countries now supporting united nations action in the middle east is yesterdays events in jerusalem <e> <s> can the minister indicate the way in which the government view those events and what action they will take in the united nations to make sure that they do not disrupt the alliance that has been successfully created <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister think of one major city of the importance of london in any other country in the industrialised world which does not have a common administration <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> i assure those who are proposing this amendment that nothing in the commons amendments makes abortion or termination of a pregnancy mandatory or compulsory <e> <s> what we are talking about in this debate and have been doing so since about this afternoon is basically the balance that one has to try to achieve between the rights of the unborn child on the one hand and the rights of the parents on the other <e> <s> if the amendments proposed by the noble baroness are carried then the tilt of that balance goes somewhat in the wrong direction and away from the position which now exists <e> <s> therefore i am opposed to the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there appears to be a growing divergence at least in atmosphere between some of the countries in the area and the united states and great britain concerning the issue of whether saddam hussein should be made to disgorge kuwait through the process of negotiation or whether we should merely stand firm and pat on the issue of seeing whether sanctions work and if <e>", "<cs> my lords i start as many other noble lords have done by congratulating my noble friend lord kirkhill on initiating this debate <e> <s> it has been extraordinarily useful <e> <s> perhaps it has demonstrated a degree of unanimity and agreement which is not always apparent across the floor of either this house or indeed another place <e> <s> i wish to echo what the noble lord lord rodney said just before he sat down <e> <s> those of us who are in the house tonight probably consist of current members of the council of europe or past members of the assembly <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord lord lyell <e> <s> if he has not attained the council yet i am sure that at some stage his party will send him there <e> <s> i know of no one who has served on the council of europe and not found it a worthwhile helpful and broadening process so far as concerns his own views attitudes and experience <e> <s> i certainly found it so some years ago <e> <s> to that extent this is a useful helpful and timely debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the question asked by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is based on the premise that the english law on the subject conflicts with the law of the community <e> <s> i have a letter in front of me signed by the attorney-general which states that a recent decision given by mr justice hoffmann has made it clear that the shops act provisions applying to sunday trading are entirely consistent with this countrys obligations under ec law <e> <s> are they consistent or are they not <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall begin by dealing with two pleasant matters before i launch into the debate <e> <s> i should like first to thank the noble earl lord caithness for his kind words about me in his opening speech <e> <s> i am most grateful to him for them <e> <s> secondly i should like to congratulate the two maiden speakers who both made extraordinary speeches today <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i may revert to one of the points that the noble earl made <e> <s> it is perfectly true as the noble earl will know that last year people from ethnic minorities were recruited <e> <s> however is the noble earl also aware that of those people have now left the force <e> <s> does the noble earl recognise that the number of applications from ethnic minorities decreased from in to in <e> <s> is the noble earl further aware that the metropolitan police force itself has admitted that this wastage is partly caused by the attitude of white officers towards their black colleagues <e> <s> does the minister recognise that this is an extraordinarily serious matter <e> <s> will he tell us what the government intend to do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that additional information <e> <s> the minister said that certain sanctions are available to the metropolitan police against officers who are convicted of racial prejudice <e> <s> however can the minister tell us how many officers have been convicted of that offence and what the penalties have been <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by thanking the noble lord lord hylton for initiating the debate <e> <s> the issue clearly needed airing and it needed open discussion <e> <s> it also needs a response from the government <e> <s> we are extremely grateful to the noble lord for launching the debate <e>"]
