["<cs> my lords may i start by extending my congratulations to the noble earl lord mansfield on occupying the position which he now does occupy and by expressing my condolences with him on the fact that he may be embarking on an experience which fell to me over many years of finding that the law reform miscellaneous provisions scotland bill was something which cropped up with monotonous regularity <e> <s> however he has an advantage that i did not have in that he is a lawyer and there <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the verdict that they arrive at may be guilty not guilty or not proven it ought not to be one to which at the end of the day they have been driven by the pangs either of hunger or of thirst <e>", "<cs> my lords one advantage of having such a long title is that anything which had to be added to it would on a percentage basis be very small <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord mansfield was good enough to send me some information about the amendments which the government were proposing to the bill all of which are of a drafting nature <e> <s> a few minutes ago the noble lord the government chief whip was pointing out that one of the governments manifesto commitments was to achieve economies and i must say that i would regard it as part of the duty of an opposition to help the government to achieve any economies where the benefit of the economy was going to be greater than the harm which is done <e> <s> i would not say that all the economies which the government are apparently contemplating would fall into that category but one which i have no hesitation in agreeing to is that i should be helpful in any way i can and in so far as this bill is concerned it is to say the very least that it is possible to cut down the printing costs <e> <s> even if i wanted to be terribly political i would find it difficult to get up an argument about substituting the word and for the word the which is perhaps one of the more important of the amendments being put forward <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble and learned lord the lord advocate a question on this matter <e> <s> as i understand it the compensation clauses arise from the recommendation of the committee under lord dunpark <e> <s> they change the law of scotland in giving <e>", "<cs> i was surprised at the way in which my noble friend put the matter because it seemed obviously grossly unfair if an award of had been made and only had been paid of that that it would be restricted to <e> <s> i thought the effect of this was to be the other way round that the award would be restricted to <e>", "<cs> if that is the intention the noble and learned lord advocate should say so and make absolutely certain that the clause makes that clear if not to anybody else then at least to the man who was expecting to get the <e>", "<cs> it does not have the same effect coming from me <e>", "<cs> my lords the question i wish to ask has relevance to what the noble viscount lord eccles has just said <e> <s> if i understand it properly this clause does not apply to scotland and if the scotland act had not been repealed i could be accused of asking a west lothian type of question and interfering in english education while the english could not do anything about scots education <e> <s> my reason for asking the question is that i was rather surprised when the minister said that the giving of information would be in relation to this general report which the secretary of state makes <e> <s> i therefore wonder exactly what was meant when we look at subsection of the clause <e> <s> this deals with the making of regulations and includes in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow on that point <e> <s> i do not understand the million <e> <s> the purport of the bill as it stands is to leave discretion to the local education authorities <e> <s> it should at least be a possibility that all of these authorities would exercise that discretion by continuing to give meals and milk <e> <s> the minister obviously is on fairly sure ground when she assumes that not all the education authorities will act in that way <e> <s> on that basis i would not disagree with her <e> <s> i do not understand how she is able to make the calculation that the authorities in exercising their discretion will save million <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister when talking to subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey has accorded to me the same courtesy as he gave to the noble earl opposite of speaking just before him very briefly in order to explain that my silence so far does not indicate anything other than the fact that the addison rules prevent me from taking part in the debate <e> <s> this will apply also to future stages of the bill so far as parts i ii amd iii are concerned <e> <s> so far as the other parts of the bill are concerned which have no effect whatsoever on development corporations i hope to make a contribution during future stages <e>", "<cs> my lords i have spoken on this subject once in your lordships house and that was on second reading on lord boothbys bill <e> <s> the view that i shall express tonight is the one that i then expressed in justifying my support for the bills second reading <e> <s> at that time there was a fair amount of criticism being voiced in the country about the extent to which sections of the population were choosing the pieces of legislation that they were prepared to accept <e> <s> at that time strong support was being expressed for the concept that acts passed by parliament which were not acceptable to some people should be ignored <e> <s> local authorities were being encouraged to ignore pieces of legislation <e>", "<cs> i intervene briefly to follow the line taken by the noble lord lord ross of marnock who referred to the importance of the words <e>", "<cs> in that case may i put the question in another way <e> <s> will the noble earl tell us of the type of house that is described as being substantially different from an ordinary dwelling-house and which made up the figure of which he apparently quoted at the last stage <e>", "<cs> what makes you think it is good <e>", "<cs> on that point might i read from subsection where it says <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord ross <e> <s> i am persuaded to do so very largely because of what the noble earl lord mansfield said about dundee on the previous amendment <e> <s> i was a councillor in dundee for years during which time many of the houses there were built <e> <s> before coming on to that i want to refer to what the noble baroness lady elliot said <e> <s> she is perfectly right when she says that no scottish local authority particularly the old county authorities and their successors would sell these houses other than to old people <e> <s> what she is overlooking is that this bill does not leave the discretion to the local authority <e> <s> it takes it entirely out of their hands and puts it into the hands of the person who wants to buy the house <e>", "<cs> no i did not <e> <s> the noble earl did <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl said that it would be open to the local authority to take legal action but in that case the local authority would have to satisfy the courts that it had been their practice to let that house to persons of pensionable age <e> <s> if in fact it had not been obviously their case would fail <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asked to come along here temporarily in case the noble earl made a speech on these bills <e> <s> i therefore took the precaution of reading them and having seen that the matter has to do with stray dogs all i want to say is that having come along here i feel somewhat in the nature of a stray dog myself <e> <s> i hope i shall not be detained for days and destroyed at the end of that time if not claimed because that is what will happen to the dogs under these three orders <e>", "<cs> my lords it is nice to know that there is a possible solution to some of our difficulties <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord mansfield started off by referring to my noble friends initial comments about having a grouse about the timetable for this committee stage <e> <s> i cannot help feeling very much surprised at what he said in reply to that <e>", "<cs> having done it it is a pity he did not finish it <e>", "<cs> please <e>", "<cs> that is a totally different point <e> <s> i was complaining about the sort of principle which the noble earl was putting forward that if a subject has been adequately considered in another place this is a justification for rushing things in this house on that basis i stick to my point <e>", "<cs> may i make it quite clear that i do not intend to get up and speak on every amendment because my noble friend will be able to do it adequately on his own <e> <s> i get up now only because i am surprised once again to hear a minister giving as a justification for not putting something into a bill that it will be done anyway <e> <s> when i occupied the position which the noble earl occupies as minister of state for scotland more than once i declined to accept advice of this kind that you should not put something into a bill because you are going to do it anyway <e> <s> that seems to me to be a perfectly adequate reason for putting it into the bill and making quite certain that it will be done <e> <s> from the way the noble earl was talking i thought that he was having made such complimentary noises to my noble friend about the way in which he had moved the amendment going to start off in really good style by saying in these circumstances the government are prepared to accept this amendment because it will not bind them to do anything which they would not otherwise do <e>", "<cs> it may explain but it certainly does not satisfy <e> <s> the noble earl the minister stated that if this provision were in the bill it would be domestic property which would not be revalued <e> <s> once again we come to this rather vague suggestion that at some time before the government may take a decision that domestic property is not to be abated <e> <s> if the government have advanced so far as that before we are finished with the bill perhaps we shall have an indication of what they are going to do <e> <s> but let us assume that the noble earl the minister is correct and that this is what the government have in mind <e> <s> the power that is contained in this clause could certainly be used the other way round domestic property would be revalued but commercial or industrial property would not <e>", "<cs> on behalf of my noble friend lord ross of marnock i beg to move that this clause shall not stand part of the bill <e> <s> once again a very wide power is being taken by the secretary of state to amend the table of deductions from the gross annual value <e> <s> in seeking to leave out clause my noble friends purpose is to give to the minister a wider opportunity to explain exactly what the government have in mind in this connection <e> <s> depending on what the minister has to say i shall have to consider whether i should seek to divide the committee on clause stand part <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that long and perhaps necessarily long explanation that he has given <e> <s> i think he will agree that it is not the sort of thing that is easy to take in when one is listening and therefore i should like to read in due course what he has said but at present my inclination is to accept what he has said and in the circumstances i am content that clause shall stand part of the bill at least for the present <e>", "<cs> when my noble friend was speaking to his first amendment he drew attention to the wording in the explanatory and financial memorandum <e> <s> the second sentence of that says <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord drumalbyn has made a useful point <e> <s> i would remind him however that when my noble friend lord ross was moving it he said that this might not be the right place in the bill to make the amendment <e> <s> i am certain my noble friend would be willing to co-operate with lord drumalbyn in drafting an alternative amendment to be inserted elsewhere in the bill which would have the effect of doing what the noble lord said would be the fair thing to do namely to apply the removal of valuation from heating systems of any sort whether in existence now or to be installed <e> <s> if therefore the noble lord is willing to carry his useful suggestion a little further and co-operate with us perhaps we can then find an amendment which he would not find defective either in its range or in its place in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am certain that if the noble lord lord drumalbyn gives an undertaking to co-operate with us in drafting such an amendment my noble friend will be delighted to withdraw this one <e>", "<cs> how disappointing <e> <s> it now emerges that whereas when last century tramways first appeared on the scene it was not beyond the capabilities of the government of the day and their advisers to amend the legislation so as to include them now when tramways have disappeared apparently it is impossible to take them out of the legislation and put the situation back to what it was before there were tramways <e>", "<cs> convenor of tayside <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to speak until if i could follow his example and talk about my friend <e>", "<cs> the minister is ignoring the point that there is here no compulsion on the local authorities to reduce their expenditure <e> <s> clause will enable them to reduce their rates <e> <s> they cannot do so at present once they fix the rates they are fixed for the year <e> <s> clause gives them the power to make an amended reduced rate but if the authorities do not care to exercise that power they lose their grant <e> <s> as i have said they are not allowed to increase their rates they are not allowed to borrow money <e> <s> if they do not reduce their expenditure there is nothing in the clause which gives the government power to say you will not spend that money <e> <s> all the government are making certain is that the authorities are going to finish the year with a deficiency to the extent if i may use words that the minister himself might use that they choose to defy the government <e> <s> they can still legally embark on that expenditure <e>", "<cs> perhaps in due course the noble earl will say where they are prevented from <e>", "<cs> it will not be a total surprise to the minister of state that i speak against the clause <e> <s> the nature of the amendments on one of which we have divided and others of which have not been moved by my noble friend lord ross of marnock would if they had been carried have altered totally the character of clause <e> <s> while i would not have chosen to use the adjective myself in describing them as wrecking amendments because i would have regarded them as improving amendments i must admit they would have totally changed the character of clause <e> <s> i am not certain that they would have made things acceptable to the local authorities in scotland <e> <s> they perhaps would have made them less odious to them to use another word that has been applied in the course of the debate <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether <e>", "<cs> the point at which i wished the noble lord the minister to give way was when he said that the secretary of state had not yet decided what action he was going to take against any local authority <e> <s> i merely wanted to intervene to point out that it would have been quite improper for the secretary of state to do anything else <e> <s> there have been complaints by my noble friend about the government taking this house for granted <e> <s> it certainly would have been a gross affront to this house if the secretary of state had acted as if the bill had already been passed <e> <s> at least he should do us the courtesy of waiting until the bill is through before he decides what action he is going to take <e> <s> i suppose that is what he is in fact doing but it is not anything that he is giving away <e> <s> it is our right <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> to form a series of amendments designed to make clause more acceptable <e> <s> i understand that certain discussions have been taking place through the usual channels and if i am correctly informed that the outcome is that the government are prepared to be a little more reasonable in the timetable at the next stage <e> <s> if the number of amendments put down make it necessary they will arrange for more time for discussion than was at first contemplated <e> <s> these amendments will not be dismissed out of hand but will in fact be the subject of further negotiation <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i do not think particularly after the way in which the minister has replied to this amendment that he can reasonably ask me to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> we get a word which is so meaningless that we cannot even agree on the correct way to pronounce it i said tymously he said timeously and he is probably more correct than i am <e> <s> it is a good example of the kind of word that we ought not to use <e> <s> i do not like the idea of withdrawing the amendment particularly when the minister once again uses the argument oh but what is being asked for in the amendment is what the minister will do <e> <s> this is how he will interpret timeously or tymously <e> <s> i am never impressed by the argument we ought not to put it in the bill because this is what we will do <e> <s> i would be more impressed if the minister were saying we ought not to put it in the bill because we have no intention of doing that <e> <s> to say that this is what you are going to do and then <e>", "<cs> on that basis i think i would be prepared to withdraw the amendment just saying in conclusion that while there may be doubt as to what the first word in brackets means none of the other words needs interpretation <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord lyell said there had not been a test case in scotland <e> <s> however he did not go on to say that it was the governments intention to wait until there was a test case <e> <s> as my noble friend lord ross said if the water authorities turn out to be right in their contention and the government subsequently change the law the poor individual who has lost the test case will have been unfairly penalised <e> <s> i hope therefore that waiting for a test case is not part of the consideration the government are giving to this matter <e>", "<cs> would not the noble earl help the committee by indicating whether the government have any preference in these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite certain that my noble friend lord ross will find that reply exceedingly disappointing <e> <s> the minister has reiterated that the government have the rating system under continuing review <e> <s> according to the figures quoted by my noble friend the next revaluation if there is no deferment <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose the noble earl lord mansfield can take a modicum of comfort from that qualified degree of support from the liberal benches <e> <s> i am sorry that i cannot follow the noble viscount lord thurso along that line <e> <s> indeed i did not intend to take part in this discussion until the minister referred to what i had said about the clause at a previous stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite certain that my noble friend will feel that tabling this amendment has been justified because it has extracted from the noble lord the minister the statement he has just made <e> <s> one knows that any assurance given by the minister will not form part of the act and that if it came to a court decision the courts would not take any account of what the minister said but only of what was in the act <e> <s> in this context however i believe that local <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl to give examples <e> <s> there are very wide differences between local authorities in scotland <e> <s> which authority for instance would be closely comparable to strathclyde <e> <s> which authority would be closely comparable to the district council of glasgow <e> <s> these are two authorities which by the size of their populations are very different from any other <e> <s> i wonder what the comparison would be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his reply the effect of which must be that there will be a substantial number of local authorities in scotland who by the nature of either their area perhaps some of the enormous territorial ones with little population or by the nature of their population stand on their own and where this provision will not be available to the secretary of state because he would not be able to compare like with like <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lyell pointed out that the clause as it stands excludes the situation where a binding contract for instance to put up a building has been entered into <e> <s> that will not be affected <e> <s> the consent cannot be withdrawn in those circumstances <e> <s> however my noble friends amendment refers to expenditure which a local authority may have entered into in good faith as a result of a consent given <e> <s> i am thinking in the building context which is familiar to me <e> <s> they may in fact have entered into a commitment with an architect <e> <s> as we <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not think of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister a question <e> <s> i am not quite certain whether i heard him aright when he first spoke about a vehicle in which such provisions might be included in the next session <e> <s> i am not certain whether before that he said if the government decide to legislate <e> <s> but he might have done so because when he came to what looked like being a very firm assurance of legislation in the next session he preceded the assurance with the words unless some obstacle arises or words to that effect <e> <s> what kind of obstacle or difficulty might arise which would stop the government from proceeding with their declared intention of legislating in the next session <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord winstanley will allow me may i complete this point <e> <s> i think that was helpful because i believe that in the first instance the noble lord lord lyell said unless some difficulty arises and in his second answer he said unless some major difficulty arises <e> <s> that i think puts a slightly different complexion on it <e>", "<cs> i join the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside in that suggestion <e> <s> as the committee will know i recently presided over a royal commission investigating legal services in scotland <e> <s> something that was very much impressed on us by one of our colleagues who happens now to be the chairman of the scottish law commission but who then was a judge lord maxwell was how in considering divorce cases in particular judges are more and more taking the view that the important parties are the children <e> <s> i apologise for referring to what was in our recommendations but we were very much impressed by what he said about the harmful effects of publicity and it was obvious from what my noble friend lord ross said that he was animated more by avoiding harmful effects both to children and to parents in his suggestion that the secretary of state was the better person to deal with this matter <e> <s> as lord wilson said there is a procedure by which these cases can be handled privately i suppose by the sheriff in chambers and if the minister would undertake to follow lord wilsons suggestion that would deal effectively with one of the points my noble friend made <e>", "<cs> i do not object to publicity being given to the decision of the sheriff and if it was adverse to the local authority then the point made by the noble lord lord mackie would be made <e> <s> the harm is done when it involves individuals <e> <s> while there can be no publicity because it is easy enough to determine as in divorce cases that the children and parents shall not be named in court if it is in open court one does not know how many people will be present <e> <s> i do not think any harm would be done in publicising the decision particularly if the sheriff wants to be critical of the local authority but that is not a necessary part of it if as the noble lord lord mackie seems to wish the whole thing were dealt with in public <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl and i hope i have not deprived my noble friend of the only time when the minister gives way <e>", "<cs> the noble earl the minister mentioned that nine schools were paying the boarding fees out of their own resources <e> <s> can he say how many of the remaining schools if any are boarding schools or are schools taking only day pupils <e>", "<cs> but how many of the schools are boarding schools <e>", "<cs> unless i misunderstood the noble earl the minister he told us that nine schools were providing fees from their own resources <e> <s> what i want to know is whether there are any boarding schools which are not providing boarding fees out of their own resources <e>", "<cs> i appreciated the extent to which in his amendment the minister was covering the ground stated by my noble friend lord ross of marnock but omitting the specified items which my noble friend gave as examples because as he said they were only examples they were not meant to be an exhaustive list <e> <s> but what i wonder is that the reference having been made to the regulations which are to be made for the local authority schools in the local authority case the information has to be made available but for some reason in relation to the second group the assisted places the words are added if requested in writing <e> <s> in the one case therefore there is the degree of compulsion that the information should reach the parents and in the other case it will reach only those parents who ask for it <e>", "<cs> i would have been happier about the government amendment if it had been the information which participating schools supply to the parent of a pupil who is eligible for an assisted place so that there would be a very broad similarity then between the requirement in the two different parts of the bill <e>", "<cs> i know that the minister has already said that he cannot improve on his original reply but that is not a commendation of it <e>", "<cs> very briefly i wish to support my noble friend in this <e> <s> like him i do not think it is necessary for much to be said at this stage to justify our opposition because he has spoken so forcefully on so many different aspects of the scheme that it would be a waste of the committees time to repeat those arguments <e> <s> all i want to say in justification of my own vote on this matter is that if we were going through prosperous times if the economy was in good shape i could see justification from a conservative point of view for an experiment of this kind being carried out because the minister has made it perfectly clear that the scheme is so limited in its financial aid that it cannot be regarded as anything other than an experiment or to give it an even more favourable description from <e>", "<cs> i can understand why the noble duke made a mistake one must read the bill very carefully <e> <s> the bill includes clauses which create a number of new sections to be inserted in an existing act of parliament <e> <s> the present amendment relates to new section a which will become part of the principle act <e> <s> the amendment deletes the last few words of new section a <e> <s> in relation to the definition of the word prescribed it is specifically stated that <e>", "<cs> i am beginning to sympathise even more with the noble duke the duke of norfolk because i am myself confused now <e> <s> the amendment which my noble friend has moved <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has put no amendment down so far as i can see relating to d which is the bit relating to denominational schools <e> <s> however i do not want to prolong this in case both the noble lord lord lyell and i join the noble lord lord ross of marnock in the bad books of the noble lord lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> i also should like to join in briefly on this <e> <s> my former home town of dundee probably has the highest proportion of roman catholics in its population after the city of glasgow <e> <s> i am speaking of proportions not numbers <e> <s> if i remember rightly one in six of the population of dundee was a roman catholic but there has never been any trouble there between catholics and protestants <e> <s> as the noble earl lord perth said the position in scotland is that we have not had trouble of this kind <e> <s> the noble earl said that he was speaking for the roman catholic <e>", "<cs> reverting to the matter of the arbiters award which was the subject of my noble friends <e>", "<cs> i am not at all certain why the words appear in the first instance unless i am totally misreading the schedule <e> <s> the schedule says that an appeal committee will consist of three five or seven members <e> <s> take a committee of three members <e> <s> if the authority members are going to outnumber the others by more than one they might all be authority members the numbers will be either or <e> <s> when you get on to five or seven it does not have exactly the same effect of course but i still do not <e>", "<cs> on that point i might say that it is perfectly true of course that judges are appointed <e> <s> but the secretary of state does not appoint a number of judges exceeding a number of other judges by one to sit alongside them <e>", "<cs> arising from the argument between the minister and the noble earl lord selkirk i want to ask the minister about the possibility of increased expenditure being forced on a local authority <e> <s> the noble earl quoted from the top of page of the bill and pointed out that the duty imposed by subsection does not apply <e> <s> he quoted paragraph <e>", "<cs> during the second reading of this bill i incidated that i would support an all-party amendment on behalf of gibraltar <e> <s> my speech then was a short one and i do not believe that in the circumstances even strong feelings or sincerity require me to make a long speech today <e> <s> i said then that it <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me i did not describe them as second-class citizens <e> <s> what i said was that the people of gibraltar were having it dinned into them every day by the spanish television authorities who said they were getting second-class citizenship <e> <s> that is an entirely different thing from my so commenting <e>", "<cs> my lords in recent weeks i have been abroad a great deal on parliamentary business at the council of europe and the like and a result is that i did not see this bill until i arrived in the house today <e> <s> so i am afraid that my comments on it must be rather bitty and i have picked out a few points in passing <e> <s> i wish to say at the outset how much i enjoyed the speech of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie which he made in his usual fashion although on this occasion he claimed to have an almost unique lack of knowledge of the subject <e> <s> i hasten to assure him as one formerly engaged in local government for many years that that need not worry him in the slightest <e> <s> it has been one of the grievances of local authorities that lack of knowledge of local government appears to be a necessary requisite for legislators so he is well qualified to seek to amend the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will allow me i must object to a man with the name of evans being necessarily classed as not being scots when one considers that my name is hughes <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend is not deterred from well-doing by this belated repentance of the noble lord lord stodart <e>", "<cs> before that is it not the case that what the noble lord lord hunter of newington has suggested is that the noble baroness has gone further than he in that she has recognised the need for an amendment in line as well as in line and therefore has it in both places <e> <s> what the noble lord lord hunter of newington if i understand him correctly has invited her to do is to substitute the word necessary for short-term in both amendments <e> <s> if that is done the noble lord is supporting the noble baroness and i should like to do the same <e>", "<cs> may i start by saying that when the noble earl lord selkirk referred to dundee he looked towards me <e> <s> i have not lived there for some time and i would like to assure the noble earl that the number of processions held in auchterarder are few and far between <e> <s> i want to support my noble friend lord ross of marnock in his suggestion that district is preferable to region <e> <s> i do so from a background of a very long time in local government although i have no experience of regional government except to try and stop it happening <e> <s> the one argument in favour of the region which the noble earl lord mansfield put forward was that the region is the police authority <e> <s> i do not believe that is important <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment which i anticipate he intends to do may i point out that i do not understand the figures quoted by the minister <e> <s> although i appreciate that he was not founding on them generally because what happens in lothian does not necessarily happen everywhere else if they were typical how does the fact that per cent <e> <s> of the property is claimed within two months reduce enormously the burden of storage compared with the time being three months <e> <s> unless i am totally wrong in my arithmetic it is only per cent <e> <s> of the property that the police will be burdened with for an extra month <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord ross of marnock in this amendment <e> <s> looking at clause i can see that there might not be great difficulty caused under subsection <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment may i ask a question about what the <e>", "<cs> might i explain that my noble friend had has to go out on a matter of urgent business <e> <s> i am quite certain that what he would expect is to hear from the minister the reason why district has been chosen instead of regional as my noble friend suggests in his amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has not left the chamber for good <e>", "<cs> the minister should not raise his hopes too high <e>", "<cs> i found myself in total agreement with the noble lady on the previous amendment and in that regard i hope that if she does not gain satisfaction on the point she will return to it at the next stage <e> <s> but i am afraid that i do not agree with her at all on this amendment nor do i agree with my noble friend because i do not see anything wrong with the wording that a council should <e>", "<cs> my lords from this side of the house i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i am tempted to do so by what has just been said <e> <s> it has not apparently been for economic reasons that the government are talking against it <e> <s> i once sat on the government front bench and the most unsatisfactory briefs i ever had as a minister were the ones which were headed resist and which then followed on to say it is not necessary to put this in because it is already covered in the bill <e> <s> it is a good principle that if there is any risk of disaster belt and braces are worthwhile and all that is being asked for in this case is that the braces should be supplemented by the belt <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start my remarks by thanking the noble earl lord mansfield for the very clear way in which he explained the purposes of the bill to us <e> <s> i should like to associate myself with what the noble earl said in thanking the noble lord lord stodart of leaston thanks which have been repeated by almost everyone else who has spoken on the bill for the way in which his committee worked and the fact that the bulk of the bill is based on the recommendations of that committee <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is so and it may well be that the proposals about which the government have been floating ideas may take care of some of that <e> <s> i would remind the noble lord lord mackie of benshie that while the industrialist or the commercial enterprise can set off its rate against corporation tax the domestic ratepayer cannot set off his rates payment against income tax <e> <s> it might be worth looking at how much government grant could be reduced if everybody was allowed to set off his rates expenditure against his tax liability <e> <s> as i do not know what the sums would he i am not putting that forward as a suggestion but it might be something worth looking at <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl permit me to interrupt <e> <s> before he leaves that point he mentioned that in the discussions the question of compensation would arise <e> <s> the financial memorandum to the bill contemplates that there is to be no additional expenditure <e> <s> so how does the noble earl reconcile the possibility of the government paying more in grant with the statement that there will be no additional expenditure <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house i would wish to speak to clauses and at the same time because clauses and are really follow-ups to clause <e> <s> i understand of course that i cannot move the deletion of all three clauses in one go <e> <s> i have made inquiries and i am in fact assured that clause must be inserted in the bill before we go on to clause <e> <s> however if i am successful and clause disappears from the bill i am quite certain that the noble earl lord mansfield will be delighted to take out clauses and also as they would be senseless without clause <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lord john-mackie replies to what the minister has said generally he put a question to me in the course of his remarks did i prefer that the authorities the sort of authorities we are talking about and we know perfectly well that lothian would figure in the noble earls thinking should return the money to the government or return it to the ratepayers <e> <s> this is almost in the category of the question when did you stop beating your wife <e> <s> it implies an acceptance of what the government did last year that the government alone determine whether expenditure is excessive or unreasonable <e>", "<cs> i adhere to my view that clause should nor stand part of the bill notwithstanding what has taken place on the previous division <e> <s> i should have been happy if i could have made it one vote for all three clauses but unfortunately if we do not divide on this clause and the next one it would look as through we had lost enthusiasm for our objection because there is no way in which a negative procedure can be followed when there is in fact no amendment <e> <s> regrettably therefore we must divide the committee on this clause and i shall save a short speech thereafter by saying that we shall also divide again on clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps the remedy is in an examination of the rules it might be possible in future for clause and to be deleted from the bill at the same time <e>", "<cs> i object to clause standing part of the bill <e> <s> i noticed a slight improvement in the vote the second time around <e> <s> let the good work continue <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness seeks to withdraw the amendment as i think she is going to do i should like to say very briefly that i listened with interest to what she said and i had sympathy with it but when i read the other amendment it seemed obvious that it covers the ground which is in the noble baronesss amendment <e> <s> all past experience shows that even when governments are prepared to accept an amendment they find it very convenient to prefer to put it in their own language <e> <s> after all they have the benefit of skilled draftsmen back-benchers do not <e> <s> i would have been content to support the amendment of the noble baroness lady elliot had it been acceptable to the government but in view of the explanation put forward by the noble earl of the government amendment amendment no <e> <s> i would agree with him that it would be better to accept that amendment rather than amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> having regard to the undertaking which the noble earl the minister gave to my noble friend lord john-mackie on his amendment it would be ungracious if we did not welcome the fact that here the government are putting in a new clause to make certain that local authorities in scotland get any benefits conferred on local authorities in england <e> <s> it is a good omen for what is going to happen at report stage in relation to the previous amendment <e> <s> i support this amendment <e>", "<cs> on clause i suppose that i am in something like the same position as a number of other noble lords to whom representations have been made about the effects of this clause <e> <s> i had a letter from the chairman of the citizens theatre in glasgow and my noble friend lord jenkins of putney received a letter from the federation of scottish theatres limited on very much the same lines <e> <s> their fear is that while the regional council continues to have power to <e>", "<cs> if i may interrupt the noble lord i said towns or cities <e> <s> pitlochry is definitely a town <e>", "<cs> at this stage i am content with what the minister has said <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to wait until the minister speaks because quite frankly i have no strong views one way or the other although despite the mass of support for the amendment at the moment my inclination is to support the bill as it stands <e> <s> i hope i am not unduly biased in that regard because i live in the hope that one day we may get back to single-tier authorities in scotland <e> <s> i am quite certain that when we do it will not be nine in number certainly it will not be as many as but it will be considerably more than nine <e> <s> so anything which contributes to the possibility of single-tier authorities is grist to my mill <e>", "<cs> once again i must welcome this clause and again for the second time the government are following the example set by the english on st may in conferring these powers on local authorities <e>", "<cs> i am not quite certain what the noble earl has said <e> <s> if the totality of expenditure is not to be altered that would seem to indicate that the government are not going to contribute any more money to the local authorities for this purpose and that the local authorities cannot find any more money for this purpose <e> <s> so anything they do in this direction if there is to be no increase in expenditure must be at the expense of some other function currently carried put by the authority <e> <s> it is hardly right that the government should undertake these things and then blithely say that there is no more money available to do them <e> <s> these two provisions in the bill are very desirable and i commend the government for having brought them forward but the government are going to defeat their own object if at the end of the day they are going to say that there will be no more government money or any local authority money <e> <s> i would ask the noble earl to look into this matter <e> <s> i do not expect another answer tonight <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to come back again when the noble earl moves the next amendment because i have already indicated that i am in favour of it <e> <s> although the noble earl said on this amendment that it is a question of loans which will have to be repaid i will remind him that in the next amendment it is a question of grant <e> <s> so his argument for the next amendment does not stand up <e>", "<cs> logically i should oppose this also but i do not propose to do so because at least there is the additional wording in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand why my noble friend wishes to take these words out <e> <s> i can also understand why the noble earl wants to keep them in <e> <s> but i have grave doubts whether their inclusion will serve the purpose he has in mind <e> <s> the clause talks about a local authority determining a rate or being deemed to have determined a rate <e> <s> both of these are facts which are obvious <e> <s> but how can you prove that an authority is anticipating something which might take place in the future <e> <s> if the authority does not make it known that it is taking action in anticipation of something i do not think the secretary of state will be able to stop it unless he is claiming that in addition to everything else he has taken power to read its thoughts <e> <s> the minister says no but how do the government work out that an authority is anticipating something <e> <s> quite frankly i do not care very much whether the amendment is accepted or not <e> <s> i think if an authority wishes to do the sort of thing which the government fear it might do the inclusion of these words will not stop it doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and while i agree with the minister that it is undesirable <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like this important point to pass without some support being given to my noble friend on the matter even although he has of course the invaluable support of the noble lord lord drumalbyn in spite of the fact that he declined to do what he was asked to do to sing it <e> <s> but i do not disagree although i do not like the convention where authority is regarded as being plural and takes are instead of is <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lord jenkins of putney in this matter <e> <s> in doing so i am aware of the fact that the amendment would make only a marginal difference it would be a difference of emphasis and nothing else <e> <s> at the moment support for the theatre and other activities mentioned in the clause is provided by the regional authorities on a wholly voluntary basis <e> <s> they are not under any duty to support theatres <e> <s> they have the opportunity to do so and the district councils have the same opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has referred to what would have been said if i had made the speech <e> <s> the only thing wrong with that is the tense because i am going to make the speech <e> <s> he knows perfectly well from the discussions which we had both before the debate and today that i do not agree with him so whatever else i may be accused of i certainly cannot be accused of cowardice <e> <s> it is a bold man who disagrees with my noble friend particularly when he is sitting on the same bench <e> <s> if my noble friend lord howie of troon is here he will not be supporting me because he has already enunciated the doctrine that anything my noble friend lord ross of marnock says is automatically correct so on that basis i am out again <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to take this opportunity of thanking the minister for fulfilling the undertaking which he gave at the last stage of the bill <e> <s> i have gone through the amendment and compared it with that which was moved by my noble friend lord john-mackie in committee <e> <s> as the noble earl has said this one is identical with just a few minor drafting amendments <e> <s> if i may give as an example the very first one that occurs in the amendment as my noble friend put it forward the act was given its full title and in the amendment as it stands it is just described as the act because in the interpretation clause the act is explained <e> <s> so there is a saving in language <e> <s> that is the sort of alteration which has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am anything i at least claim to recognise what is possible and i know that in matters of this kind even if i had persuaded the minister of state that this was the right thing to do he would have found himself in serious difficulty with his colleagues in another place if he had so far departed from the ideas to which they appear to be so firmly attached <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl concludes his remarks which is a different way of putting before he sits down may i ask him a question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to follow what has been said by the noble lord lord kilmany in this matter which is of great interest to himself and obviously equally to my noble friend lord ross <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but it is enough for me to keep it to members of this house at this stage <e> <s> i particularly would not want to follow it in view of the intervention by the minister when he i thought made a rather oblique reference to scone in comparison <e> <s> so i will leave that alone <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord underhill asked me it was a coincidence that i happened to be here if i would comment on the amendment <e> <s> i am not certain he will be happy that he asked me to do so by the time i have finished <e> <s> i understood him to refer principally to the scottish motorist in england and i shall come back to that <e> <s> i understood the lord advocate to say that the scottish motorist committing an offence in scotland is at no disadvantage compared with an english motorist committing an offence in england so from that point of view i am perfectly satisfied with what the noble and learned lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that this has been done <e> <s> i am only sorry that the bill left this house with this ridiculous clause in it <e> <s> it was spoken against here and i cannot remember the justification that was put forward for imposing a possible fine of on a child making a slide on snow <e> <s> this is one case where obviously the commons have more sense in the matter than we had <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question in reference to the apportionment of expense where there is multiple ownership <e> <s> it has been the position for many years that the basis for the apportionment of such expenditure is the rateable value and in fact in the disposition of many of these tenement properties the title deeds will include a reference to the repairs for instance being apportioned on this basis <e> <s> would i understand therefore that if the authority found it necessary to depart from this basis there would be sound reason for doing so and that otherwise the apportionment according to rateable value would be the normal method of proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords then the answer to the question would be that we would normally proceed on that basis <e> <s> i may mention that by coincidence <e> <s> i have just paid an account for which is my share of the repair on a property <e> <s> the bills vary from to p depending upon the rateable value <e> <s> if it had been divided equally then whoever was paying -odd would have been well off and i should have had to pay a little more than my <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that to a certain extent that gives the answer to the question of another method of apportionment <e> <s> i referred to the title deed because obviously if a repair which is carried out is in the ordinary way to be divided in a particular way according to the ownership of the property then it will be equally reasonable if the local authority carried out work of that kind that they would follow that method <e> <s> that is obviously one way of doing it <e> <s> i would suggest that if there were a close examination of what is happening in all the local authorities in scotland one would find that apportionment by rateable value is by far the most common method although i must accept the information that it is not done by all <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord the minister i am not confused by having the document before me <e> <s> may i ask him a simple question <e> <s> when he says that if the grant is not forthcoming from the eec the government will do their sums again does that open the door to an increase in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i almost feel an intruder in this debate and had it not been for the fact that i had the privilege and the pleasure of chairing the royal commission i should not in fact have ventured in <e> <s> for instance i noticed that my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey stated with total truth that he was able to conceal his enthusiasm for this bill <e> <s> after we leave the part relating to divorce and my remarks will be confined to that i neither feel it necessary to agree nor to disagree with anything that he said because i do not feel any competence whatever in the matter <e> <s> however i do not find myself in agreement with the rather lukewarm welcome if welcome is in any way an appropriate word to use for the first part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i think it is correct to say that it has lost some if its force my lords <e> <s> but if i were now talking as if the royal commission was still sitting i would say that it still remains a sound principle that a whole loaf is better than half a loaf <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate answered the questions that i put to him in relation to the rules <e> <s> can he do that now or would he prefer to write to me on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for that answer <e> <s> in case it does not occur to them to look at these matters is there any particular way in which their attention can be directed to the desirability of doing so <e> <s> can the noble and learned lord do that or can anyone else do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as a variation on the question asked by my noble friend may i ask by how much would the first figure given by the minister have been reduced if the government had not compelled the gas board to raise its prices by per cent <e> <s> more than the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be very interesting but it is not an answer in any way to the question which i have asked which is to what extent would the figure have been less if the government had not imposed this additional burden of per cent <e>", "<cs> i do not think that it would be improper for me to make a comment at this stage <e> <s> at first glance it would seem that what the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside has proposed is very much in line with the recommendations of the royal commission <e> <s> in fact it goes further because the royal commission recommended that the sheriff court should be the only court of first instance in these matters <e> <s> that was contained in our recommendations nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> in recommendation no <e> <s> on divorce we said that the sheriff court should have exclusive jurisdiction as a court of first instance <e> <s> then we made a third recommendation in which we said <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that explanation but i still think that that is not what his amendment does <e>", "<cs> may i be made certain of what the noble and learned lord has in mind <e> <s> i think he and the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey used the words the parties <e> <s> does this mean that in the ordinary course of events the sheriff court would be the one which was most likely to be used in divorce actions once this comes into operation but that if both parties wished to to go to the court of session that could be done under the proposals of the bill <e>", "<cs> further to the remarks of my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey i would draw the committees attention to another recommendation of the royal commission which appears in our chapter where we said on the subject of civil procedure and jurisdiction <e>", "<cs> i am not certain whether what has been suggested will be suitable to the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey but i say right away that it would not be suitable to me <e> <s> in the first instance one aspect of the matter which very much concerned <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend withdraws the amendment i rather take it from what he said and i hope that i am not taking more than he meant that the normal procedure would be that the court would ask for the social worker <e> <s> but if they thought it was a case where the social worker was not going to be the best person or the best qualified person then the court would proceed to this list of other qualified people <e> <s> if that is what he is saying it is a certain source of consolation to me <e> <s> if it is not then i am afraid that i should like to come back to this at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i shall be surprised if the noble and learned lord the lord advocate does not tell us that on a matter of this kind he will obviously have consultations <e> <s> i personally have no objection to the amendments being accepted comforted by the fact that from all past experience when governments and ministers have been obliged to consult people on various matters it has not followed that they have been compelled to act <e> <s> the noble earl is not asking that the lord advocate shall act only with the assent or concurrence of the lord president but that he should consult him <e> <s> i am quite certain that such consultation is the normal procedure in matters of this kind <e>", "<cs> i think in this matter the secretary of state has some very useful ammunition at his disposal in discussing these fees <e> <s> one of the arguments which was advanced before the bill came before the house and which has been advanced since it came before the house is that there is no real reason this has been put forward by those who have practised and hope to continue to practise in the court of session to believe that procedures will be any cheaper in the sheriff court than they would be for a similar action being raised in the court of session <e> <s> so the secretary of state will certainly be able to give these people the opportunity of proving the correctness of their case by adjusting the fees accordingly <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord fraser has referred to the per cent <e> <s> at one point he talked about normal fees and at another point i think he talked about the ordinary fees <e> <s> my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey mentioned the fees that might be paid on the private side <e> <s> surely in arriving at what is a normal or an ordinary fee one does not necessarily take into account the very high fees which may be earned by certain people <e> <s> it is well known that not everybody in the profession commands the same fees in the private market as everybody else <e>", "<cs> my lords having given way to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie who has made what was for him a long speech because he does not usually speak for seven minutes i shall have to cut short my remarks <e> <s> until my noble friend lord ross of marnock had done his research i had not realised how densely populated this house was by former ministers of state for scotland <e> <s> in fact if one looks at the attendance one might say that it is as some of our english colleagues would say almost infested by former scottish ministers of state <e> <s> but there are now two of us present the noble lord lord strathclyde and myself <e> <s> i believe it would be appropriate for me also to extend a word of welcome to the noble lord lord gray of contin <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord the minister for having so helpfully gone through <e>", "<cs> my lords there are some cases where the reference is to codifying and to minor improvements <e> <s> when i listed those which had no change i excluded from my list any which had a reference to minor improvements and those which i listed relate to the clause only being codified in modern language <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt again <e> <s> i think that what the noble lord has said is perfectly reasonable but if there are any of the clauses related to codifying only where there is any change in the law can he perhaps write to me before the committee stage and let me have details of which the clauses are with of course a copy to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he remembers that on a previous occasion a <e>", "<cs> my lords for a successive number of years the government have said that it is still possible for more cuts to be made <e> <s> the minister says that it is still possible to cut expenditure <e> <s> for how many more years does he think it will be possible to do that <e> <s> is he going to the ultimate conclusion where he suggests that local authorities should shut up shop altogether so that there will be no need for exchequer equalisation grants or for rates to be levied <e>", "<cs> i am very surprised that the minister of state should have reacted as he did to this amendment which undoubtedly i think would improve the bill <e> <s> i particularly appreciated what my noble friend lord ross of marnock said on the previous amendment when he was inviting the <e>", "<cs> in the light of what my noble friend lord ross of marnock said about whether this bill was necessary and that a much more reasonable thing would have been to produce a simpler bill giving the additional powers which are contained the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will remember that at second reading the tome to which my noble friend referred arose as the result of an answer which lord gray of contin gave to me that he could not at that time say exactly whether when it was said that this was just codifying there was not in fact a change and that he would circulate more information <e> <s> i must agree with my noble friend so far as i was concerned it certainly arrived but it did not arrive at such a time that i could make much use of it <e> <s> in case the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has any fears on the matter for the next stage of this bill i will give him this assurance that i have no intention of making any use of it to search for yet more amendments <e>", "<cs> i could have understood that explanation if it had cut down elsewhere <e> <s> i would expect that thereafter all one would need to do is refer to the list <e> <s> but right in the very first line of section the words the list of public roads are repeated again so the words in brackets do not remove the need for reference to it <e> <s> for that reason i agree with my noble friend that these words in brackets do not serve any useful purpose <e>", "<cs> it is not <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has not picked me up correctly <e> <s> i said section not clause <e> <s> i should have said subsection and it is the very first line line of that subsection which reads <e>", "<cs> will the noble and learned lord therefore go further and indicate to us what the harmful consequences would be if my noble friends amendment was accepted <e>", "<cs> no one could of course do what would seem to be the straightforward thing and define a list of public roads in the interpretation clause which after all is the easiest place to find it <e>", "<cs> i do not want to make this a duet between us but the noble and learned lord has misrepresented me <e> <s> i said that in one of the acts which are listed and where the changes are taking place the interpretation clause is at the beginning of the bill not that one found interpretations in other clauses at the beginning of a bill <e> <s> it seemed to me that the old way of having interpretation at the beginning of the bill was easier to follow than having it right at the end of the bill <e> <s> it is much easier to turn back to say clause than to look for clause clause or in the case of this bill clause <e> <s> that is what i said <e> <s> i was not suggesting that we go back to the old method although it seemed to be an advantage <e> <s> i believe and i have amendments down later on this issue of interpretation that it will always make a bill easier if wording is used and people do not know exactly what it means that they can turn to the interpretation clause to find the meaning <e> <s> they should not have to search through different parts of the bill to find different parts of the interpretation <e>", "<cs> did the noble lord conclude his remarks by mentioning the simple word alter <e> <s> that is my amendment and i shall come back to it <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord ross of marnock referred to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he has also said that he has down amendments <e> <s> we have worked on the bill quite independently <e> <s> i produced some amendments <e> <s> when we got together to my astonishment at least we found that we had produced alternative versions of the same amendment only in one case and that was amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might interrupt the noble and learned lord <e> <s> is he suggesting that when a local authority renews a road takes off the surface lays it aside and goes to all that expense it then puts it back and tries to make it exactly the same as it was previously <e> <s> renewal must mean alteration <e> <s> it must mean using different materials and so the road must be altered <e>", "<cs> i must come back to this matter again <e> <s> once again the noble and learned lord has brought in a word that does not appear in the bill <e> <s> he is saying that repair or renew would not be covered by alter <e> <s> but the government have not found it necessary to give the authority power to repair a road <e> <s> i take it that one reason for that is that repair could be comprehended in altering or improving <e> <s> but in dealing with these two amendments he has twice used words which do not find their way into the bill <e> <s> he used change and he has now used repair <e> <s> it seems to me that the more he speaks the more he justifies the rejection of the earlier amendment to keep in without prejudice to the generality and having accepted that wording the simpler we keep the later stages the better <e>", "<cs> i now beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have no connection with any cycling clubs or any vested interest to declare <e> <s> i ask a question <e>", "<cs> i wonder how many of the officials responsible in regional authorities for the maintenance of this list realise that it has been kept in conformity with the conditions of an act of or how many of them none of whom could have been born at the time even know that there was such an act of parliament <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that my experience of local authority officials over the years is closer than that of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i am certain that they know what their duty is <e> <s> however i doubt whether they know the act of parliament that requires them to do it <e>", "<cs> when i was seeking to take abutting out it was not because i did not realise that there were circumstances when you could not properly say that a property fronted <e> <s> the place which immediately springs to mind from my local knowledge is arbroath where it is common for the gable end to be that which is on the street and the front of the house sensibly faces not a fairly uninteresting road but looks into the home garden <e> <s> the way i looked at it was that if frontager could be defined as meaning one whose property either fronted or abutted it seemed to me that it would be quite reasonable in the same sort of light to talk about fronting and then define it as including fronting abutting or i would hope the other <e> <s> it has not been done in the past <e> <s> but the dividing up of large gardens has become fairly common and as land becomes more and more expensive will almost certainly continue to be a feature for a number of years ahead <e> <s> as we are seeking to modernise the circumstances it would be better to have equity <e>", "<cs> i must say that my first reaction is that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has accepted this stretching of draftsmanese to the very limit <e> <s> quite honestly i do not see how anybody could possibly take the view that the is made in the position i have put it has any reference other than to the representation <e> <s> however the noble and learned lord has said that he will consider it <e> <s> i do not think that we should legislate in a type of english which nobody would dream of using in everyday life if it is possible to do otherwise <e> <s> i think that what the noble and learned lord has said is very thin indeed but as he has said he is prepared to consider the matter further i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> no i do not <e> <s> further up the subsection we read <e>", "<cs> on the front page of the bill after the words explanatory and financial memorandum it states the bill codifies and modernises but surely if we are to take the word modernises literally we ought to try as far as possible to put legislation into terms which ordinary people can readily understand <e> <s> it may well be that for years or years or years it has been done in a particular way <e> <s> but it is not so many years ago since this house sitting in its judicial capacity took the decision that it did not need to be bound by decisions which the house had previously taken <e> <s> if the house could do that in relation to giving decisions on law surely we do not necessarily need to stick to the form of words which has been hallowed by use over decades or as in the case of this legislation for more than a century <e>", "<cs> i have one further question <e> <s> if the bridge authority fails in its responsibility and the bridge falls taking the road with it does the road authority have a claim against the bridge authority for negligence <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if this motion is agreed to does it not mean that there will be no report stage on this bill <e>", "<cs> i do not think we should accept that <e>", "<cs> i am not at all clear about the matter <e> <s> as the noble lord lord gray of contin explained the effect of the amendment would be to allow the offence to go to any sheriff court <e> <s> i am not clear about what the position would be if the amendment did not go into the bill <e> <s> the clause ends with the words <e>", "<cs> if the minister goes slowly i am sure the advice will come <e>", "<cs> although the noble lord accepted my advice and talked slowly and his noble friend moved fast it has taken an awful long time for the answer to become available <e> <s> the noble lord has not answered my question <e> <s> have i missed a reference in the

do some funny things in legislation but merely to imply which court will deal with the matter is taking things a little too far <e> <s> i think that i have harried the minister enough on the point at this stage <e> <s> as i said i did not expect to be involved in the bill otherwise i should have given him notice that i would query that point <e> <s> i apologise for not giving him notice but i hope that he can enlighten me further before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> we shall note that explanation with interest and keep it in our minds for use on future occasions <e> <s> so often in your lordships committee when amendments have been put forward to a piece of legislation we have been told that they are not necessary because the powers already exist under other legislation <e> <s> in fact that was the answer in relation to the sheriff court that it already exists under other legislation or by implication <e> <s> so here is a case where although the minister says that it already exists under other legislation we are going to make sure <e> <s> we are to have belt and braces and repeat it in this bill <e> <s> it is therefore a useful precedent <e> <s> incidentally the reference to prompts me to say that i think that the noble lord lord gray of contin would be terribly miscast as big brother <e>", "<cs> as the minister has said this is a simple amendment <e> <s> there is no difficulty in under-standing it <e> <s> that is a merit in itself in the present governments legislation <e> <s> i am always anxious to expand my knowledge of legal english as distinct from everyday usage <e> <s> the minister can perhaps tell me the difference between being in command of a boat and being in charge of a boat and why it is necessary to have both <e>", "<cs> that is most interesting <e> <s> it is also quite amusing to find that the minister when asked the difference between being in command and being in charge used all along the term in charge of the boat <e> <s> he did not find it necessary to talk about someone being in command of the boat <e> <s> this seems to be another example of adding needless words to a piece of legislation unless there is some legal difference as i mentioned earlier between being in command or being in charge <e> <s> i do not know <e> <s> but it is certainly not a matter that i would wish to pursue much further unless the latest expedition of the noble lord lord lyell has produced an explanation <e>", "<cs> that would seem to indicate that there should be some change of the law in the box <e>", "<cs> that would seem to be a reason for leaving out in command if even the master is not in command of the boat <e>", "<cs> these four amendments are all in the same pattern and would indicate that when the sections which are at present in the third column were removed there would be nothing left but the preamble or short title <e> <s> was the bill drafted in such a terrible hurry that so many mistakes were made and nobody noticed that if we took out these remaining sections we would be asking the committee to legislate to leave in four acts with only a title and a preamble <e> <s> it certainly does indicate that the usual high standard has hardly been achieved in this bill <e>", "<cs> i would not wish it to become the pattern that we should attack people in this house who are doing a job <e> <s> that was certainly not my intention <e> <s> i did say that this did not come up to the usual high standard <e> <s> frequently perhaps what south of the border would be regarded as odious comparisons have been made between draftsmen south of the border and those in scotland <e> <s> all i said was that this certainly is not up to their normal standards <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think the lord advocate is doing me justice in this matter quite unwittingly obviously <e> <s> i do not alter the language being used <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> moves the wording under <e>",

alternative form of wording will be more acceptable <e>", "<cs> that seems to me a perfectly good reason for accepting the amendment if fewer words can achieve exactly the same purpose <e>", "<cs> may i say that there are a number of occasions where i have only dealt with the first time that some words appear <e> <s> i took a rather charitable view of the governments activities in that if they accepted the amendment they would search through the bill for all the other places where the same thing has to be done <e> <s> i am a firm believer in the doctrine if you have a dog dont do your own barking <e>", "<cs> i am quite satisfied with that explanation and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is it possible within the working of the house to alter the wording from if they so decide to if they think fit <e>", "<cs> may i put it like that <e>", "<cs> in clause on page of the bill subsection makes reference to a principal road <e> <s> in clause there is a reference to a main road <e> <s> but i cannot find in all these descriptions of roads in the interpretation clause any statement as to what a principal road is or what a main road is <e> <s> it may read very simply but

a principal road is <e> <s> similarly there is the description of a main road in clause which i could not find defined anywhere either <e> <s> i do not guarantee that those are the only two places where these words occur having found one of each i thought that was enough to go on with <e>", "<cs> on that basis may i ask the noble and learned lord what is the difference between a principal road and a main road <e> <s> on page there is a reference to a main road <e> <s> it may be all very well for the secretary of state if he is the only person in scotland who knows what a principal road is

when one seeks to elaborate on the language used we are told that the more you define the more you endanger the general principle <e> <s> but when you have these various definitions of roads which at first glance would cover everything and then you have two other adjectives applied which are not interpreted in any way i would suspect there is a possible case where somebody goes to the court and says i am not covered when the judges have to look at the bill there is nothing in it to help them to say what is a main road and what is a principal road <e> <s> from what the noble lord the lord advocate has said it would appear to be perfectly possible to define these roads in such a way as to remove any doubt <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the lord advocate has said i accept that there is some justification for leaving clause as it stands because it relates to the possibility of a road which might not come into existence <e> <s> while he is quite correct in the references in clauses

his reference to the sheriff <e> <s> unless i have missed it i do not think that there is any appeal against the apportionment <e> <s> the sheriff would not come into the matter <e>", "<cs> yes i agree <e> <s> whatever method is adopted will be equitable in the area in which it applies <e> <s> but what i was concerned about was that if different methods were adopted some people would say this isnt equitable <e> <s> they have done it the wrong way <e> <s> i am paying an awful lot more than i should have done because in the adjoining region they have done it another way and on that basis i would have been paying <e>", "<cs> subsection <e>", "<cs> from the way in which the noble and learned lord has explained what would happen under clause we are brought back to the wording where the maximum would be the maximum statutory penalty and on indictment an unlimited fine <e> <s> i think that there is merit in using them both <e> <s> incidentally is there such a word as triable <e>", "<cs> when the noble and learned lord was making his first reply he gave as an example altering the camber of the road <e> <s> i must stress the word altering <e> <s> if you alter the camber of a road will that be included in a definition altering the road <e> <s> surely no one could possibly say that altering the camber of a road was not altering the road <e> <s> if in this bill the banking is part of the road because if it is not this would not apply even within the meaning of the word otherwise then if they change the banking they are also altering the road <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if that is the case and i accept the explanation which the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has given what is the meaning at the beginning of subsection of the words <e>", "<cs> i am quite content with that and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has been very fair and i shall certainly look with great care at the words he puts down in place of those which appear in clause <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was much impressed by what the noble earl lord selkirk said <e> <s> the noble lord will probably agree that what the minister has said about the other piece of legislation is helpful <e> <s> but it is only helpful to the extent that the roads authorities take a reasonable view <e> <s> the places where purpose signposting is most necessary are the roads that bypass existing communities <e> <s> these communities have existed for centuries but suddenly find due to the policy of the roads department that their very existence is imperilled <e> <s> i recall for instance the row a year or two ago when the village of blackford i then lived only a few miles away was by-passed <e> <s> within a matter of months the jobs in that community were almost destroyed <e>", "<cs> on lighting <e>", "<cs> in a way that is quite a satisfactory answer not from the point of view of lighting the road but to have this statement from the lord advocate that there are some cases where the government are prepared to admit that a local authority can be a good judge in its own case <e> <s> in recent years there has not been much evidence of the fact that the government thought that the local authorities had that power to make a proper decision <e>", "<cs> we shall not agree on this because it is a matter of government policy local authorities are free to do as much as they like provided that they do not spend money on it <e>", "<cs> this is probably one of the few amendments which would affect the principles contained in the bill <e> <s> it would be futile to call a division on it at this stage <e> <s> however in withdrawing the amendment and in not moving the other three i give notice to the committee that i intend to return to the matter at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> it may then be possible to deal with it at an earlier stage in the proceedings <e>", "<cs> i notice that in the heading to clause the words works and excavations both appear in the plural <e> <s> then throughout the clause works is always in the plural but in all cases except one excavation remains in the singular <e> <s> the one instance where it is shown in the plural is in subsection where it states <e>", "<cs> i take the opportunity of the debate on whether the clause shall stand part of the bill to ask the government what their intentions are for further debating the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> we had an informal discussion about what would be a reasonable time to adjourn <e> <s> no one can say that we have delayed the legislation <e> <s> we have been exceedingly co-operative <e> <s> but with all the remaining amendments there is no way that we can sensibly conclude proceedings on this bill tonight <e> <s> many of the remaining amendments are government amendments in the name of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and at least one could be the subject of a major debate <e> <s> there are large amendments to the schedules and all the amendments to the schedules are government ones <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that on the last occasion we debated only or so amendments <e> <s> i remind him that tonight we did not start consideration of the bill until ten to six and we adjourned for minutes for dinner which is the equivalent of starting at seven oclock <e> <s> we have been debating the bill for four hours and twenty minutes and have dealt with amendments <e> <s> we are working at least two and a half times the speed that we did on the first occasion <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl will permit me i would say that i do not want to alter the arrangements <e> <s> as the chief whip has said normally the arrangements work perfectly satisfactorily <e> <s> but until dinner there was no indication at all as to how far we might go <e> <s> i doubt very much whether the lord advocate would say that the bill has been handled unreasonably <e> <s> we have spoken briefly on amendments <e> <s> the only amendment on which in fact there was any lengthy debate was one from the noble earl lord selkirk which attracted support from a variety of parts of the chamber <e> <s> apart from that every single amendment has been handled expeditiously <e> <s> so i think that we have done our best <e>", "<cs> ten minutes to six <e>", "<cs> if it had been an english bill there would not have been only one speaker from the opposition benches on it <e>", "<cs> i suggest that the noble lord looks at the timing tomorrow to see how long we have spoken <e>", "<cs> when the minister in his last intervention justified the selling of these houses at a discount he pointed out quite rightly that the value of a house with an occupying tenant is less than a house to which the purchaser can immediately gain entry <e> <s> when the government originally fixed the discounts at figures between and per cent <e> <s> did <e>", "<cs> will the minister give way on this point <e> <s> i am sorry to interrupt him but where in the legislation is any discretion given to the local authority which refuses to sell on the basis that the tenant has obviously and admittedly been a bad tenant <e>", "<cs> i suggest that the noble lord will still be talking tomorrow before he receives that answer <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord the minister give way on this point <e> <s> i promise that i will not interrupt again <e> <s> he has just said as a justification for the two years that where a house is tenanted it reduces the value by per cent <e> <s> i have not had any evidence that in the private market the extent to which the value is diminished is affected in any way whatsoever by the length of the tenancy <e> <s> you do not find that a house in the private market is diminished by per cent <e> <s> because the person has been a tenant for only two years but it becomes per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> because he has been there longer <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has again referred to the pre-emption conditions <e> <s> i wonder whether he can refresh my memory on how this works <e> <s> as i understand the position at present houses are sold at between and per cent <e> <s> of their market value at the time when the sale takes place and if the bill becomes an act in its present form the discount will range from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> of the market value at the time when the transaction takes place <e> <s> let us assume therefore that it has been possible to insert a pre-emption condition in the sale <e> <s> when the house comes on the market if the local authority is to operate the pre-emption condition under what terms does it buy it back <e> <s> does it buy it back at the same discount on the market price at which it was sold or does the pre-emption right enable the authority to buy back the house only at full market value <e> <s> if the second course is correct then of course there is every encouragement for someone to buy so that he can at least pass on a profit to his heirs <e>", "<cs> my lords had the government know in advance how many changes would have to be made in legislation which already exists because of this desire to standardise on the word road i wonder whether they would ever have embarked on the bill at all <e> <s> it is quite obvious that the changes are very much greater than they ever anticipated considering the number of amendments to existing legislation made at the last stage and the ones being made in amendments tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for having made these changes <e> <s> my only regret is that he did not find it possible to get away from fronting or abutting <e> <s> incidentally by a slip of the tongue the noble and learned lord named the last amendment to which he was speaking as <e> <s> it is of course <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am content <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow what my noble friend lord carmichael has said <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate instanced the western isles <e> <s> are there any other authorities which would require this reference to general planning authorities <e> <s> if not why does it not follow the normal pattern of saying an island as district authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for dealing with this <e> <s> the wording which i suggested at the last stage appeared in another part of the bill <e> <s> as the bill stands it almost looks as if the secretary of state is not going to pay any attention to any representations which are made because it seems to indicate that he would go ahead anyway <e> <s> the alternative wording later in the bill is better so i am glad <e>", "<cs> my lords it is gleneagles <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like to leave as my noble friend lord ross of marnock put it for gleneagles and points north because that is a correct description of where i am going without making it quite clear that i am in full agreement with him <e> <s> i am not leaving at this point because i disagree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend on his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if anybody reading clause about snow gates had any doubt as to what snow gate meant and if he were a lawyer for instance and was asked what is a snow gate <e> <s> his answer would be that there would be an interpretation of snow gate somewhere in the act <e> <s> so he would turn to the interpretation clause <e> <s> he wants to find out what is a snow gate in terms of clause <e> <s> when he gets to the definition he finds that it says that it is what it says in clause <e> <s> having said it first in clause why do we need later on in the bill to say to somebody look back to to find out what is a snow gate <e> <s> i think that this is a case which may be perfectly sound from a lawyers point of view but from a laymans point of view it seems to be utter nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak again the noble and learned lord the lord advocate said it is not the purpose of legislation to provide work for lawyers <e> <s> i think we must accept that but he must admit that it has a frequent side effect working that way <e>", "<cs> i should like to intervene briefly to make three points <e> <s> the first relates particularly to what the minister of state has said <e> <s> he referred to the various inquiries which have taken place <e> <s> probably the most important of these was the layfield committee of inquiry <e> <s> that committee reported on its proceedings before the government gave their undertaking at the election that it would be part of their programme to abolish domestic rates <e> <s> one of two things obviously emerges from what he has said <e> <s> either the government made that undertaking purely for electoral purposes without having gone into the matter at all or if they went into the matter fully we should like to know the reasons which have emerged since to make them state that they were wrong in <e>", "<cs> i cannot possibly agree with the minister that if this amendment is carried the secretary of state will lose flexibility <e> <s> in reading the wording of the bill the minister will see that flexibility does stay <e> <s> the bill would read <e>", "<cs> if the minister is right in his contention how does he interpret the words may have regard to <e> <s> how can that phrase be interpreted as being obligatory on the secretary of state <e> <s> we have had many arguments in parliament about may or shall <e> <s> may quite obviously does not always mean shall or must <e> <s> i submit that may have regard to gives the secretary of state all the discretion that he requires <e> <s> it has been sufficient in many acts of parliament in the past without including the words in his opinion <e>", "<cs> may i put a question to the minister <e> <s> does he agree with what my noble friend has said and which i backed up that these words make the secretary of states decision unchallengeable in the courts <e>", "<cs> that is very interesting but i repeat my question <e> <s> does the minister agree that the inclusion of the words in his opinion makes the secretary of states decision unchallengeable in the courts <e>", "<cs> i think the answer has just come along <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is a council of europe convention on extradition and that when the assembly of the council of europe was addressed last year by the spanish prime minister he had a question from a british delegate who asked about the treaty with spain <e> <s> he replied that spain had ratified the convention but that britain had not ratified it <e> <s> would <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for that explanation <e> <s> i shall read it with interest because at the moment i do not feel that i have elucidation <e> <s> however i wish to assure him that in this matter i have no fear i lost all that way back about march or april of this year when we were wading through the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the point raised by the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood about unfenced roads and with reference to the terms of amendment no <e> <s> would the putting up of a notice saying beware of sheep on unfenced roads be regarded as having taken all reasonable steps not to prevent the animal straying but to warn people of the possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords there is another momentous matter to be raised <e> <s> in the amendments to schedule the sort of rough change from feet to metres has now been made into the exact figure which makes me wonder why in amendments nos <e> <s> and four metres becomes but in amendment no <e> <s> four metres for some reason becomes metres <e> <s> just so that i do not lie awake at night wondering why this is done can the lord advocate explain it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be pleased to hear that not every scot will be dissatisfied with his original answer <e> <s> if what the noble lord lord stodart of leaston was asking did take place scottish banknotes like scottish beef might be easier to find south of the border than in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords now that amendment no <e> <s> has not been moved i take it that it will not be necessary to move an amendment to line on page to put the first word into the plural instead of the way in which it appears in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before that is done could i have an answer to the question which i put to the lord advocate <e> <s> i did not think it was a stumper <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has referred to the possible confiscation of traced profits of convicted traffickers <e> <s> having regard to the difficulty of tracing these profits have the government considered placing the onus on a convicted trafficker to show that any assets he has have not come from drug trafficking <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not feel it necessary to apologise to the noble lord lord crawshaw of aintree for not following him though i found what he had to say both interesting and informative <e> <s> but coming as i do from a small community far off in scotland where if during the summer we saw a black man or a yellow man our thought would be that the holidaymakers are coming from far away this year i could not talk with any knowledge at all on that subject <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to your lordships in general and to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate in particular for the fact that my name does not appear on the list of speakers <e> <s> he used the lovely phrase returned from my peregrinations which is difficult for me to say so i shall not repeat it but i was in norway as part of a visit from the western european union when we met the ministers of defence and foreign affairs and parliamentarians <e> <s> when i went there i was not certain whether i should be back yesterday or today so i did not arrange for my name to be put down <e> <s> i tried this morning to get my name added to the list through the usual channels but on this occasion the channels must have been blocked somewhere so i have just come in as a blank speaker unnamed <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord the lord advocate tells us that he is going to accept these amendments i am looking to see whether he is nodding his head or merely smiling i should like to add some further words to what my noble friend has said <e> <s> the first amendment amendment no <e> <s> substituting the word services is not merely paying obeisance to what the royal commission said when it suggested setting up a legal services commission <e> <s> i remarked on second reading that it did not matter whether it was called a commission or a board <e> <s> the word services is however deliberately put in because although some of the functions suggested by the royal commission for such a body could not come under the description of legal aid they have a bearing very much on legal aid its availability and what is known about it <e>", "<cs> two statements have been made and with one of them i find myself in total agreement <e> <s> that was the one made by the noble and learned lord lord wheatley that everyone in scotland wants to see the best form of legal aid possible <e> <s> i have no difficulty in accepting that because i think that it is absolutely true <e> <s> i have more difficulty with the other statement <e> <s> more than one noble lord has said that there is great disquiet in scotland about the bill <e> <s> i do not believe for one moment that where two or three or or or or people are gathered together the main subject of conversation among them is the bills inequities <e> <s> as far as i know the general public may be vaguely aware of the bills existence but they know nothing about its contents <e> <s> i accept that there is considerable disquiet in the legal profession about the <e>", "<cs> i think i said or if i did not i meant to say that at least eight members should be from the legal profession <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> says that there should be four members appointed by the faculty of advocates and four by the law society <e> <s> i know that my arithmetic is correct four and four make eight <e> <s> i do not go as far as that but i agree with the noble earl that it is nonsense to say that there should be only one member from each body <e> <s> as my noble friend lord morton of shuna said if the board is to meet on two days a week and we appoint someone who is experienced we shall confine ourselves to someone who has retired from active work and who has ample spare time to sit on the board <e>", "<cs> i cannot pretend that i begin to regard that as a satisfactory answer <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has just said that it does not mean that only people on supplementary benefit will be entitled to get legal aid and i do not think that the noble earl lord selkirk ever suggested that <e> <s> what he was objecting to and what i am going to object to is a permanent linking to the supplementary benefit levels <e> <s> i accept that this is perhaps a field where it is more desirable than otherwise for the levels on both sides of the border to be the same <e> <s> i would not dissent from that <e> <s> what i dissent from is that it should be linked to the limits in supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> on that basis and hopeful that the noble and learned lord may get an early reply from his right honourable friend the secretary of state perhaps he will let me know before the next stage if any progress has been made i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my response to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate must be the same as the previous one <e> <s> if there is anything wrong with what is being done it is in the linkage <e> <s> unless i can hear something more helpful before the report stage of the <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate is giving away practically nothing <e> <s> even now he does not say that it will be done <e> <s> he uses the words so far as i can envisage <e> <s> but his eyesight might be wrong <e> <s> we have in fact really got nowhere <e> <s> i wonder how often a solicitor is placed in the invidious position of having to say to a client yes we could take this case <e> <s> i am certain that we would win the case <e> <s> i am certain that you would get what you expect but i must tell you that after my expenses are paid and counsels expenses are paid there is nothing left for you <e> <s> so in these circumstances i must with reluctance advise you not to do anything about it <e> <s> on the assumption that the solicitor will inevitably give the best advice available to his client there must be cases when he has to send a client away totally dissatisfied on the basis that he has been told that he has a perfectly good case and that he is almost certain to recover what he is suing for but that it will never reach his own pocket <e>", "<cs> may i ask that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate advises his noble friend that this is a case where one would be entitled at the next stage to give an undertaking that such regulations will be introduced <e>", "<cs> i might also mention that when the noble and learned lord did not feel able to accept amendment no <e> <s> our amendments to clause which included a system of lay advice and representation before tribunals his attitude was that this is going far beyond the purpose of the board <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord does not intend to encourage the system of lay advice which obviously at best would be in the simplest of cases he should not at the same time be discouraging the provision of legal advice in what almost inevitably will be the complicated cases <e>", "<cs> i should like to add to what i said earlier that the royal commission laid down proposals which would rule out frivolous or otherwise unnecessary actions of the kind to which apparently the noble and learned lord lord denning has referred as frequently arising or possibly frequently arising in the english courts <e> <s> we have not made any headway with the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and i have now the distinction in this amendment of having lost some ground because for the first time the noble and learned lord lord denning has found it necessary to oppose an amendment <e> <s> we seem to be backtracking rather than improving <e>", "<cs> on a second front this is different from anything that has gone before because for the first time in proceedings in committee the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has found some support <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the most revealing comment made by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e>", "<cs> am i wrong in thinking that somewhere in the bill there is a definition of disposable income to the extent of stating the factors that must be excluded <e> <s> i cannot remember where i saw that <e>", "<cs> my lords i was rather astonished to find the noble and learned lord the lord advocate praying any remarks of mine in aid in refusing this amendment <e> <s> it is perfectly true that at an earlier stage in our proceedings i did not accept the argument that a body appointed entirely by a minister without necessarily consulting other people would be a body which was wholly dependent on the secretary of state for its opinions or that it did not itself exercise an independent point of view <e> <s> i felt obliged to say that because having on more than one occasion been a member of a body appointed by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too ask a question about this <e> <s> would the board be entitled to interpret this subsection as giving it the right to disregard the guidance of the secretary of state if it felt that though the guidance was given in good faith it was not the best way in which the board could operate <e> <s> would it be entitled just to regard it as advice and therefore be free not to follow it <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws his amendment as i gathered he said he might do may i say that these words which are preceded by the word or would seem to indicate that the provision is intended to deal with a matter which is either a question of principle or in the public interest <e> <s> the very least that the minister should do is to give an undertaking to my noble friend that he will show how these words can be applied in a way which includes both the public interest and a matter of principle <e> <s> at the moment it sounds as if it is an alternative <e>", "<cs> in putting myself in danger of being regarded by the minister of state as being of inferior <e>", "<cs> it

dundee are asking that it would be an opportunity for associations to be formed for the purpose principally or perhaps solely of avoiding the right to buy <e> <s> where this position exists in england is there any evidence perhaps even where there are local authorities which the government dislike because of their attitude to sales that any housing association of the kind that he apparently fears

<e> <s> i would suggest to the noble lord that the worst possible thing to do is to put ones head down and drive on <e> <s> there comes disaster <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to support my noble friend in his objection to this being handled in this way <e> <s> my reason for doing so is not tied to the absence of lord glenarthur it is because lord skelmersdale in supporting this new clause stated that he accepted that it would have been possible and proper for this change to be made in the scottish housing bill which is before us <e> <s> but he then went on to excuse its absence from that bill by saying that it was now too late in the proceedings to put it in the scottish bill <e>", "<cs> when the noble and learned lord lord denning made his speech he said that if anyone had only the bill and the amendments he could not possibly understand what this was about <e> <s> as these are the only documents that i have if i have the matter wrong i must plead that in my defence <e> <s> however i do not think that i have got it wrong because of consultations which i have had in the interval <e> <s> when the noble and learned lord lord denning constantly referred to the law of england i thought it was just the usual mistake which people made when they meant the united kingdom and that they thought the two were the same <e> <s> however i lost that idea when the noble and learned lord read amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble and learned lord read it in its entirety and i shall repeat the subsection <e>", "<cs> when the noble and learned lord lord denning came to the word british he waved his hand towards me <e> <s> does that mean that he intends to reword amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord indicated that he would read some of the questions which were put <e> <s> is he prepared to make the complete list available in the library of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the minister seemed to indicate when moving the earlier motion that he was not likely to accept this amendment <e> <s> let me say that i am very surprised at the governments attitude <e> <s> i regret to say that in scotland the labour party generally and labour-controlled authorities in particular were much slower than the conservative party to recognise the benefits of housing associations <e> <s> it was due very much to conservative government activities that the housing association movement in scotland got off the ground <e> <s> today housing associations are not a matter for partisan argument in scotland or anywhere else <e> <s> therefore it seems to me amazing that the party which did so much to create the opportunities in scotland should apparently be setting its face against the creation of new charitable associations along the lines mentioned by the noble earl lord perth <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that it was out of order to quote what was said in another place except in the case of a minister <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a happy chance that my place on the list should be immediately after that of the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour with whom i have regularly had the most amicable disagreements <e> <s> nothing that she has said in this debate today will change the need for disagreement but i hope that it will not require me not to continue to be amicable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble baroness asked me that because i meant to mention this figure <e> <s> one of the things i asked the finance department was what it expected the community charge to be in tayside <e> <s> i was told it was expected to be <e> <s> i said but the scottish peers met the people from cosla on thursday last week and the figure mentioned there was from to and i should not have thought that tayside would have been so far up the scale as <e> <s> he said id better have <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not quite correct on that point because the student will not be paying per cent <e> <s> of the figure in the borders because he is to pay per cent <e> <s> of a notional figure which will be laid down and which is expected to be the average for scotland <e> <s> if he is in a low community charge area he will benefit

i do not know his source of that information but if it is correct it means that p off income tax is then meaningless to half the people in scotland <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord glenarthur has to be congratulated on having passed that hot potato on to his noble friend <e> <s> when the noble earl read the paper in front of him did it read better to him than it did to the rest of us <e>", "<cs> i must apologise if what i am now asking was dealt with last week <e> <s> unfortunately last week i was suffering from a cough and it would have been an even greater source of suffering to the committee if i had been here <e> <s> i followed my doctors advice and stayed at home <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter did me an injustice when he said that what i said had nothing to do with the amendment <e> <s> i wanted to tie the points together <e> <s> i was raising a second case in which a local authority would be deprived of revenue <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will at least do me the justice of assuming that i listened to what my noble friend said and that i knew what the purpose of his amendment was <e> <s> my noble friend was drawing attention to the situation where a local authority would be deprived of possible revenue because of exemptions <e> <s> he suggested a way in which that could be remedied <e> <s> whether the noble lord agrees that it is a good way is beside the point <e> <s> obviously we have different views on that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he said <e> <s> i shall certainly take the opportunity of reading what was said last week <e> <s> i have no doubt that my noble friend lord ross can tell me whether i should look at the report of monday tuesday or thursday to save me ploughing through the lot because it does not sound like the most interesting reading <e>", "<cs> following on from what the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour has said is it the intention of the government to indicate to employers that this is the way in which they wish the matter to be dealt with <e> <s> the minister has already said that discussions about alternatives to the rent or rate-free accommodation are going wide of the bill <e> <s> the noble baroness lady carnegy is saying that the obvious answer is that if a notional value of x pounds is placed on what is being given in the rate-free accommodation and he ceases to get it and has to pay then x pounds should be added to the actual sum that is paid <e> <s> is that the governments intention <e> <s> it would appear that it was the intention of the noble baroness lady carnegy but she has not yet reached the front bench <e>", "<cs> i did not suggest that we would legislate <e> <s> what i asked was whether this was the sort of guidance that the government would give to employers that this is what they would expect them to do <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord glenarthur concentrated his remarks on uninhabitable properties and said that the prescription will make it clear that such properties will not be liable to the charge <e> <s> however most of our discussion has not been about uninhabitable houses it has been about uninhabited and unfurnished houses <e> <s> that is what happens when someone moves from one home to another and then finds that he cannot sell the house that he has vacated <e> <s> the explanatory memorandum makes it clear that <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has to be congratulated that this time he was handed an easier one <e>", "<cs> may i also come in on that point <e> <s> i thought that the minister indicated that housing body would be defined somewhere as district council scottish special housing association and the new town development corporations <e> <s> if it were so confined then obviously that is all right <e> <s> but if there is not a tight definition then one would find that housing associations would be roped in as a housing body because in ordinary language housing association is a housing body <e> <s> but i do not think that the government are intending to involve it in this work <e>", "<cs> in view of the point raised by the noble lord lord renton concerning the difficulty of finding interpretations and knowing where to look for them perhaps the minister may consider specifying a scottish housing association or a new town development corporation in such places instead of saying or any housing body <e> <s> then it becomes perfectly clear that the matter is being confined to the district council the ssha and the new town development corporations <e> <s> will he keep that suggestion in mind as a possibility <e>", "<cs> reference was made to the possibility of a student being designated <e> <s> my noble friend lord carmichael mentioned that possibility <e> <s> it is fairly common certainly in edinburgh and possibly in glasgow for flats to be occupied by three four or even more students and for them to be the only occupants <e> <s> however subject to anything else which may come up in connection with students as they will not be paying the community charge the position will arise that nobody in that flat will pay the community charge for the flat <e> <s> how does the registration officer satisfy himself that they are all students and that therefore nobody should be designated for that flat <e>", "<cs> it is so brief as to be totally unhelpful <e>", "<cs> the three lines which my noble friend lord ross has asked to be excluded contain words in brackets <e> <s> they read <e>", "<cs> partly yes <e> <s> but the noble lord has not answered the other point that i raised <e> <s> who is that person <e> <s> is it the inquirer or somebody who is listed as being at the address <e>", "<cs> the words in brackets are <e>", "<cs> i am happy to accept that the minister believes that is the position <e> <s> he has not convinced me however <e>", "<cs> the noble lord having found in his reference to section of the act what he later described as a pitfall following what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter had to say about it now seeks to justify the schedule by saying that it is just a reenactment of what is in the act <e> <s> however what i took from what he said is that the principle of seeking to have a check on local authority expenditure did not start in <e> <s> therefore what was in the bill in would not be the first time that this matter came up <e> <s> if it was necessary in to put into the bill something which had been acted upon for years before that is an added argument for having it in the present bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak briefly in support of this amendment although quite frankly it would not have been my choice <e> <s> i would put it forward as a third possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended to intervene earlier and indicated this to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter but at the stage when i thought of doing so the minister was obviously anxious to get up <e> <s> he made an attempt which was frustrated so i thought it would be wrong to come in with what might be different points after the minister had spoken thus obliging him to say with the leave of the house which he might have done though more likely he would simply have ignored what i had said <e> <s> one course would have been distasteful to him and the other to me <e>", "<cs> my lords did not that figure arise from the fact that in the original proposal the charge was not to be related to the area but to a notional figure which the scottish office then estimated would be <e>", "<cs> it is not in any thirst for legal knowledge that i venture to intervene but just mild <e>", "<cs> especially when one of them will not work <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say a few words <e> <s> i must apologise to the minister <e> <s> i was out seeking information when he rose to speak <e> <s> in the light of one of the remarks he made i do not think that i am being unfair in coming into the debate at this stage <e>", "<cs> i do not know what my noble friend thinks about what the minister has said on the assurances given about consultation but i should be very surprised if he is in any way satisfied with the answer given by the minister to the first amendment we were discussing which was to leave a subsection out of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble earl lord perth indicated his intention to put forward a motion on scottish matters he indicated that as it was coming from the scottish peers association an all-party organisation he thought it would be proper that they should endeavour to find something which would not be party political <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in thinking that the secretary of state said that businesses opened <e>", "<cs> when the minister answered lord pestons point about who would raise the action he indicated that any ratepayer could apply for a judicial review <e> <s> then he went on to talk about the powers of the auditor which seemed to be a fall-back position <e> <s> if no ratepayer wanted to involve himself in seeking a judicial review there would still be this other matter <e> <s> am i right in thinking that when he talks about the powers of the auditor he is referring to the new clause in amendment no <e> <s> ba and the new schedule after schedule which empowers the auditor to issue prohibition orders against an authority which is infringing any of the provisions in the bill <e> <s> if so what happens in scotland which is specifically excepted from the new clause and the new schedule <e>", "<cs> i should like to return to my little play within the play and the origin of the matter in respect of an offence <e> <s> the minister said to his noble friend lord campbell of alloway who was about to leave but has now stopped that he thought it would be judicial review <e> <s> i think that the minister is right about that matter <e> <s> at the bottom of page is set out the power of the auditor to apply for judicial review in the new schedule <e> <s> i should like to be certain as to the position of scottish local authorities in respect of that matter <e> <s> this schedule and the clause which refers to it are specifically stated to apply only to england and wales <e> <s> i do not expect the minister to answer my question even though he has just been joined by the noble earl lord dundee <e> <s> however in order that i might know whether i need do anything at the next stage i should appreciate it if the minister would write to me outlining the scottish position <e>", "<cs> i should like to make the same point as the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> if this amendment is not put in the bill would the judge be unable to draw such inferences as he thought fit <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble and learned lord is considering the word expertise he might care to bear in mind that it does not present any difficulty whatsoever to ordinary people <e> <s> i doubt very much whether lawyers or judges would find difficulty in understanding what it means <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister to take the matter a little further <e> <s> if a document enclosed with the voting paper is neither on it nor attached to it can he stretch the words on the voting paper to include such an unattached enclosure or to take the question further if the union has plenty of money and puts the document in a separate envelope but posts it at the same time as the ballot paper where does that leave the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to object <e> <s> the minister of state has described the housing scotland bill as perhaps the greatest housing bill since that of <e> <s> my chief whip is getting behind me and i am not going to pay the slightest attention to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to come back to what happened before the house rose for pleasure <e> <s> when the house was about to be adjourned i intended to ask the government to state their intentions in view of the fact that we were starting consideration of the housing scotland bill so very late <e> <s> unfortunately the noble lord in the chair did not hear what i said and i was deprived of the opportunity <e> <s> i understand however that further discussions through the usual channels indicate that we shall not proceed tonight beyond amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that is a reasonable basis and so i am content <e>", "<cs> i also should like to support these amendments <e> <s> i note that the explanatory and financial memorandum where it deals with scottish homes includes the words <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend lord carmichael of kelvingrove i support the spirit of what the noble viscount lord thurso has put forward <e> <s> he introduced an interesting case for the appointment of advisory committees <e> <s> unfortunately so far as i can see that is not what the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is a rather unusual development <e> <s> the noble lord lord gray of contin describes the amendment as outrageous and then proceeds to delay its withdrawal <e>", "<cs> the reference which the noble earl lord selkirk made to the number of functions makes me think of a rather stupid little point and perhaps i may be forgiven for raising it <e> <s> i noticed in looking through the functions that we proceeded from letter h to letter j in order i presume to avoid a conflict with the roman numeral i

rights of housing associations <e> <s> those rights are available at the present time according to the information which i have <e> <s> on this question of succession the minister when speaking on

the statement made by the minister sounded extremely favourable throughout but like other members of the committee i should like to read it tomorrow <e> <s> it is not that i suspect that somewhere within it there is something in small print that cancels out other points but rather because some of the views that have been expressed may be capable of further discussion <e>", "<cs> the way in which the minister has put forward the amendment makes it sound totally reasonable and i thought that he would proceed to an amendment dealing with clause a <e> <s> i am certain that not every member of the committee from south of the border will understand it <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble earl lord selkirk <e> <s> i pray in aid something which the minister said

come back with three schedules that were understandable the selkirk version in triplicate if i may so put it but not for heavens sake the drafters version in triplicate <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord said just now that it would be better to have a good leaven of scots <e> <s> does that mean that there will be more than one scot among the commissioners <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister

hesitate to enter a discussion on this english item <e> <s> however there appears to be a repercussion for scotland <e> <s> i have looked at the scottish act and i cannot see any equivalent section

that there is no power given to any officer of a local authority in scotland to compel his authority to make such appointments as he demands <e> <s> that is an important point <e> <s> i had not noticed this extraordinary power which is proposed in an english form <e> <s> i should have felt that we had made an awful mess in dealing with the earlier act if we had allowed something like that to creep into it <e>", "<cs> with the best will in the world that is not an answer <e> <s> i am asking about the position in the scottish act <e>", "<cs> as far as i can see the noble lord is now talking to the previous amendment <e> <s> this has nothing to do with unlawful action <e> <s> he has missed the boat <e>", "<cs> i do not disagree with the governments idea that if a local authority frustrates the intentions of parliament by understaffing or under-equipping its departments there should be a method of dealing with it <e> <s> in recent legislation there has been more than one case in which english law has been adapted to follow the pattern in scotland <e> <s> this is a case where the government can achieve their objectives in england in exactly the same way as they can achieve them in scotland <e> <s> the local authority is given the responsibility of appointing the necessary staff <e> <s> if the finance officer who is the official concerned in this case feels that he cannot carry out his functions for the reasons which i quoted from the scottish act he can report to the secretary of state that the authority is depriving him of the necessary powers <e> <s> the secretary of state can then require the authority to provide the necessary staff and the secretary of state himself may determine what is required <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness lady stedman says that she does not intend to move her amendment perhaps i may ask the minister the noble earl lord caithness to look at the scottish position and give me information about it in writing <e>", "<cs> i am interested to hear the minister say that the differentials in scotland are not nearly so great as they are in certain london boroughs <e> <s> some people in scotland will be very glad to hear that <e> <s> we have been accumstomed over the past year or two to hear the scottish office the secretary of state and other ministers talk of certain local authorities in scotland as though

conceive of a one-sentence letter coming out of the scottish office <e> <s> i suggest that that is on the same parallel as the possibility raised by the noble lord lord gray of mr benn being the next

the bill but even if the amendment were carried if the provisions of the bill otherwise remain the same the chairman would have a casting vote so if the question of the co-option of members arises after the board is constituted and it takes a decision to co-opt members i cannot envisage the possibility that that decision will not have been preceded by the election of a chairman <e> <s> as the bill specifically states that the chairman and vice-chairman may not be staff members that guarantees that the first chairman and vice-chairman will be from the parent members <e> <s> however clause which refers to the election of a chairman does not say from among the parent members but from among the members <e> <s> therefore if a chairman is to be elected after the co-opted members are in it would seem that the chairman could be one of the co-opted members <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support my noble friend <e> <s> the best solution would be for the minister to make it possible for a representative to appear as a member of the board <e> <s> however as a fall-hack the position referred to by the noble baroness lady carnegy may be workable but only if the board went to the length of setting up a community education committee <e> <s> otherwise the committee can handle only the matters referred to it by the board <e> <s> therefore if the board refers nothing under the community education to the committee nothing would happen <e> <s> it is possible that the board could set up a committee for this purpose <e> <s> perhaps the minister can make such a provision <e> <s> after consideration of the multifarious advice which will be given on setting up the boards perhaps he can give an indication that such a committee may in certain circumstances be a desirable way of going about it or that it would to use the phrase of the noble baroness lady carnegy which was in less than her usual elegant language do the trick <e>", "<cs> can the minister even in thought have been adding yes they can but it is most unlikely that their colleagues will permit it <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that the noble baroness lady carnegy should have made those remarks <e> <s> my noble friend has quoted the law on the matter <e> <s> it lays down that the question must be decided by lot <e> <s> i can remember a long time back an amusing experience that occurred when i was a member of the council <e> <s> the cause of the experience was not amusing because it was the regrettable death of the lord provost a year before his term of office expired <e> <s> there were two nominations for the post at the succeeding meeting <e> <s> one was a senior magistrate who by virtue of his position occupied the chair <e> <s> there was equality in the voting and the senior magistrate voted himself into the lord provostship by use of a casting vote <e> <s> he was months through his -month period of office when it was discovered that he had broken the law <e> <s> the choice should have been settled by lot <e> <s> it was interesting that some time later the matter of equality of votes arose again in the appointment of the lord provost and the matter had to be settled by lot <e> <s> i have a feeling that the man who was lucky enough to draw an eight was elected because his opponent chose a deuce <e>", "<cs> is the minister implying that the boards will be specifically told by the department that they must draw up standing orders to regulate the proceedings so that they will not be in a position where they can either have standing orders or do without standing orders <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord sanderson of bowden decides not to call for a report the one proviso that helps the situation would be removed <e> <s> in those circumstances will the minister undertake to have a look at the situation suggested in the amendment <e>", "<cs> one of the points made by the noble lord lord addington was that the proposal would not affect many people because most meetings would almost certainly take place in the evening <e> <s> therefore the loss of earnings would be limited as he has suggested perhaps to people who may lose evening work by attending a meeting <e> <s> as it stands the bill refers to payment of subsistence allowances <e> <s> if a man or woman loses wages he or she has lost subsistence for that period <e> <s> therefore should such payments not fall quite naturally under the payment of a subsistence allowance <e>", "<cs> unlike the noble baroness lady carnegy i do not attach the weight to the views of the head teachers that she does <e> <s> it would be astonishing if they were to write to the secretary of state to say no we do not think a head teacher should be the chairman <e> <s> it would be almost like crying stinking fish in their own shop <e>", "<cs> i thought that the amendment was an important one but it did not occur to me for one moment that it was so important as to justify this lengthy intervention by the noble and learned lord in the course of which he demonstrated that he is well qualified to keep us on our toes so far as the law is concerned <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the noble and learned lord has answered the question <e> <s> will there be an equal number plus one or is it assumed that the headmaster must be a nominee of one of the groups <e>", "<cs> is it clear that the education authority would have the power to make a temporary appointment <e> <s> that is not stated in the bill but is it stated elsewhere <e>", "<cs> there is some merit in what the minister said and i am inclined to think that my noble friend will accept it subject to reading those comments later <e> <s> in the great majority of schools the parents will fairly quickly become aware of what is going on <e> <s> the difficulty will be in the large schools in the cities and in the senior secondary schools in the county areas <e> <s> it will not be so easy informally to contact the parents <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the only reason i stood up was to draw attention to the fact that was wrong and to prove that i had read the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is not on the list of speakers but that is purely through inadvertence because i came prepared to speak <e> <s> however it would not be fair nor would it be other than a dangerous precedent in a time controlled debate to take advantage of the gap <e> <s> therefore i hope to say what i had intended to say on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say on what the scottish office bases its figures and where it obtained the numbers who are likely to be involved <e> <s> can the minister also tell us the percentage who it is expected will be making payment <e> <s> i understand that in perth and in kinross where i live the government estimated that people would pay but the registration officer has been unable to find of them <e> <s> therefore the local authority can base its figure <e>", "<cs> my lords in dealing with my question the minister gave a very interesting answer that had nothing at all to do with the question <e> <s> after the noble lord has had time to look into the matter would he be good enough to write to me about it <e>", "<cs> as an interested spectator but not an applicant for an id card i ask the minister whether the admission card of a guest of the club will have to have a photograph attached to it <e> <s> if so that will rule out the people about whom my noble friend is asking <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the reference to ethnic or other groups if mrs whitehouses organisation should object to the posters about pregnancy which appear all over the london underground will the authorities then decide to withdraw them because they give offence to her although i am quite certain that she will not be threatening to bomb the underground <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be in order to tell the minister that when she says she is speaking only for herself her answers are better than those from her department which she reads out <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding my name i should not have felt it necessary to intervene in an amendment concerning wales but for the remarks of the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> he suspected that the reason why scotland is not included is because of the political situation there <e> <s> there is no evidence whatever that the government pay the slightest attention to the political situation in scotland and that could not possibly be the reason <e> <s> it is because several years ago the scottish office had the courage to take action regarding these matters <e> <s> legislation was passed concering drink in public places and especially at football matches <e> <s> that is the reason why hooliganism was controlled much earlier in scotland and before any sign of it being controlled in england <e>", "<cs> following on from that question perhaps i may ask the minister whether she considers <e>", "<cs> i have just been warning my noble friend that he may not regard this intervention as helpful but i was once a member of the north of scotland hydro-electric board <e> <s> we had a request sponsored by the late sir david robertson for the supply to somebody who was in such a remote <e>", "<cs> at this stage i also wish to support the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e> <s> i only add the words at this stage because the noble lord lord campbell of croy said the provision would be dealt with by order <e> <s> i looked at the words at the top of page of the bill but i could not find a reference to an order <e> <s> i presume that there is a reference in some other part of the bill <e> <s> clause for instance mentions order-making powers <e> <s> i do not know whether that is the reference i have missed <e> <s> either that or i have <e>", "<cs> is that stated on page <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> that takes care of my first point <e> <s> the only other thing i wish to mention is that the noble lord said he would be willing to accept an order rather than have his provision inserted in the bill <e> <s> he said that if it were inserted in the bill there would be a danger that the bill would be made hybrid and that would result in delay <e> <s> i have a feeling that i am not the only member of the committee who would regard such a consequence as being totally desirable <e>", "<cs> when i spoke earlier i indicated a certain reservation <e> <s> i should like to say now that what the noble lord lord sanderson of bowden has just said is totally satisfactory <e> <s> it reassures me completely and it will be a delight to have it on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all be grateful to the noble lord lord mccluskey for the powerful speech he made in introducing this short debate <e> <s> his qualifications for taking part in such a debate are obvious as he has just proved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lords pardon i still have two minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall begin by joining the noble lord lord stodart of leaston and my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey in expressing pleasure that the noble and learned lord lord emslie has broken his silence of the past decade <e> <s> it is many more years than that since i first met the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it was when this house was considering a scottish provisional order <e> <s> he appeared for one of the parties arguing against the provisions contained in part of that order <e> <s> it is perhaps an indication of the quality of his advocacy at that time that the committee in its entirety accepted the views he expressed and that that part of the order was not implemented <e> <s> i too hope that we shall enjoy the benefit of his experience during the committee stage of this bill <e>", "<cs> i was interested in what the noble and learned lord lord hailsham had to say about the change in legal aid <e> <s> he mentioned that the per cent <e> <s> which the late lord elwyn-jones achieved had been whittled away <e> <s> my noble friend lord mishcon confirmed the per cent <e> <s> figure <e> <s> he said that the figure had been drastically reduced <e> <s> when we on the scottish royal commission considered legal aid we found that the position then it obviously has not improved in the interval could be summed up in the phrase which was put to us which was that only the very poor and the very rich could afford to litigate <e> <s> is the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor prepared to allow legal aid to remain in that position <e>", "<cs> when the noble and learned lord the lord advocate objected to amendments nos <e> <s> and he did so on the ground that what was already in the bill the more general form was preferable to the detail that these amendments provide <e> <s> however this amendment and i speak with no knowledge of the law whatsoever substitutes a very long new clause for a comparatively short one <e> <s> is there any provision in subsections and of the new clause which could not be undertaken by the courts under the terms of the clause as it now stands <e>", "<cs> if nothing eventually goes to the sheriff court the first three subsections will be unnecessary <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord morton of shuna referred to the royal commission of which i was proud to be chairman <e> <s> we sat for four years and it is now years since our proposals were published <e> <s> a good part of our time was taken up with the subject of conveyancing <e> <s> i do not think it can be argued that there was total satisfaction at that time with the solicitors monopoly in conveyancing <e> <s> the evidence which was given to us showed that there was widespread feeling on the matter but on other subjects also <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be grateful to the noble baroness lady stedman for giving us the opportunity to discuss this matter today <e> <s> i should like to add to that my congratulations on the way in which she presented her case <e> <s> i agreed with almost everything she said although i am not so sure about a local income tax <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that there tended to be lower taxes in a year where there are elections <e> <s> i should say that there will be elections in scotland in may <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the noble earl is risking disagreeing with the noble and learned lord lord hailsham perhaps i may ask whether the advice he has received is from a legal quarter a civil servant or a draftsman <e>", "<cs> my lords when i sat on that bench opposite i was always very pleased when i was able to say that an amendment was not acceptable because it contradicted what we intended to do <e> <s> on more than one occasion i refused to accept a brief which told me that i should not accept the amendment because it was already covered in <e>", "<cs> for the benefit of those of us who have followed the debate with great interest but little understanding perhaps i may ask what is a barefoot pleader <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i now understand at least that part <e>", "<cs> i wish to support my noble friend lord carmichael of kelvingrove on this very important amendment <e> <s> the minister of state in another place when he argued against such action seemed almost to be under the impression that outside the highlands and islands area conditions in the remainder of scotland were such as existed only in the main parts of the central belt <e> <s> but in parts of scotland the rural remote parts conditions are very similar to those which exist in the highlands and islands <e>", "<cs> i was rather disappointed by what the minister said perhaps because of the contradictions <e> <s> i almost gained the impression that he was speaking from briefs written by two different people supplemented by as we are accustomed to expect from him his own remarks which were altogether apart from the brief <e>", "<cs> it is not very usual for one colleague to rise to correct another <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe interprets the amendment a little wider than the amendment states <e> <s> in the phrase <e>", "<cs> when i occupied the position which the noble lord lord sanderson now occupies i frequently refused to accept the sort of brief which he has which effectively says <e> <s> all the things which you want can be done <e> <s> all the things which you want will be done and then goes on to say but we shall not put it in the bill <e> <s> i invite the minister of state to look back nearly years <e> <s> he will then find a number of occasions when the sort of amendment which he is now resisting was accepted by me <e> <s> if everything is to be done and it is a principle like this it ought to be in the bill to make matters absolutely clear <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for what the minister said about the extent to which he is prepared to disregard briefs and the fact that he is not going to prejudge the amendments <e> <s> the proof of the pudding will be in the eating <e> <s> it will be interesting to see when we get to the end of the evening how many briefs show that he is merely saying what is already written on paper before him <e>", "<cs> i wish to support my noble friend in this amendment and to point out that it is very similar to what appears in the next clause in relation to highlands and islands enterprise with the necessary alterations for instance instead of highlands and islands in clause clause says scottish <e> <s> then one clause mentions economic and social development but social development is left out of the other <e> <s> it just mentions economic development <e>", "<cs> the minister of state pointed out something that we must have noticed namely that there are no government amendments down to the bill <e> <s> i come back to what i said earlier and i hope that in due course i shall be proved wrong <e> <s> the ministers brief can be summed up in the following terms we want this bill back without any change whatsoever <e>", "<cs> i did not catch what the minister said <e> <s> what was the reference to clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to what i said <e> <s> i am glad that i made those remarks because it evoked the response from the minister that when he gave that assurance he was not reading from a brief <e> <s> i said that perhaps at an earlier stage he appeared to be reading from briefs which had been written by two different people plus the words of a third his own <e> <s> i am glad that the comment was in his own words and not from the brief <e>", "<cs> this is the part of the bill in which i have the greatest interest because of my past connection with new towns <e> <s> i strongly support the amendment for reasons arising from that experience <e> <s> when i became chairman of glenrothes development corporation in the pattern was very similar to that found in new towns whether in england or in scotland <e> <s> the relationships between an existing local authority and the new town was not always of the best because the local authority tended to regard the new town development corporation as carrying out functions which more properly should rest with the elected authority <e> <s> from time to time there were differences between them <e> <s> we were always accused of not being an elected body but a creature of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i do not want to interrupt the noble baroness but she has overlooked one point <e> <s> the new town development corporations in scotland each included at least two elected members of the local authority <e> <s> that is still the position <e> <s> there are still local authority members in new town corporations <e> <s> we must accept that as regards the industrial and commercial enterprises the development companies will be the successors of the development corporations <e> <s> if it worked with the development corporations i can see no reason why it would not work with the development companies <e>", "<cs> i was very interested in what the minister had to say about this matter <e> <s> he said that there would probably be a limited company with shareholders <e> <s> will the participation about which he spoke more than once that the local authority will be able to undertake include the district council being entitled for example to take up shares in the company <e>", "<cs> that is fair enough <e> <s> perhaps the minister will be good enough to write to me when he knows the answer <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will find it possible to accept the amendment or something similar <e> <s> i have spoken of my experience in new towns <e> <s> i also have long experience in local government <e> <s> one of the biggest mistakes in housing made by local authorities was building enormous housing estates with a lack of facilities <e>", "<cs> the minister said that he would refer to housing <e> <s> are we discussing amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> i assumed that it was only amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> can the minister ensure that at least four members on this side have copies of that document before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i have been passed a note referring to the ministers comment that local authorities might become shareholders <e> <s> i do not understand the note which reads <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should be happier if i had not received my note <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend <e> <s> i have received representations on practically every conceivable aspect of this from the new towns in scotland <e> <s> the chairman of the glenrothes residents association telephoned me a week last sunday to let me know that a very recent survey showed that per cent <e> <s> of those who replied wished to transfer to the district council <e> <s> in livingston the chairmen of five different tenants associations they appear to be organised on a sort of ward basis there have all written to say that they wish to have the right among others to transfer to the district council <e> <s> the same applied in east kilbride <e>", "<cs> the minister says <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could phrase my question another way <e> <s> does consider include accept <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will give the assurance that the main consideration which the government take into account in the options will be the option the tenant wants <e>", "<cs> the government may take into account what tenants want but will they necessarily accept what the tenants want <e>", "<cs> did the minister answer my question regarding where the white paper commitment appeared in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to sound like tweedledum and tweedledee but if the governments commitment is absolute what is the objection to having it in the bill <e>", "<cs> i hope the minister will reconsider this amendment otherwise we must come back at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> he appears to be arguing against the amendment under the misapprehension that it relates to compulsory transfer to district councils <e> <s> all that the amendment does is insist that the district councils are among the options available <e> <s> if that is what is said in the document that the minister has in front of him i cannot see the objection to putting it in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to intervene on this matter because the noble lord lord nugent of guildford said that not many noble lords understood the mysteries of our procedure in this house <e> <s> i am very much in that position <e> <s> i do not understand why the amendment we are discussing was said to be out of order as it did not come within the long title of the bill <e> <s> as i understand the position when we start the committee stage of the bill we start on the basis that the long title should be postponed <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support my noble friend lord carmichael on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware that a considerable part of that took place while i was chairman of east kilbride development corporation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not need to add much to what the noble lord lord carmichael has said other than that i agree with everything he said
