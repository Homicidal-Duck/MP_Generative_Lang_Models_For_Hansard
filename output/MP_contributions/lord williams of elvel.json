["<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to associate myself with my noble and learned friend lord silkin of dulwich and the noble baroness lady warnock in thanking your lordships for the courtesy that you have extended to me and my fellow maidens if i may use that expression today and indeed on our arrival in your house <e> <s> many noble lords have been kind enough to tell us about what we should be doing and should not be doing <e> <s> i retain with special affection the advice of a noble lord who told me that it would take me at least five years to find my way around this house <e> <s> in the context of todays debate where a number of noble lords have complained about the absence of figures i regard the presence of this particular figure as being of fundamental importance <e> <s> however it seems to me at the present stage to be a serious under-estimate of the time it will take me to get established here <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the noble earls courteous and complete exposition of government policy i should like in my turn to pay a somewhat unexpected tribute to the government and to congratulate them on the constancy of stated purpose in their economic policy <e> <s> i believe that nobody can complain that the government have not stated and restated on many occasions and with great clarity the central thrust of their policy <e> <s> if i may sum it up it is that inflation must be defeated and the defeat of inflation is the best way to achieve growth and full employment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that this tin council fiasco would never have taken place had the london metal exchange a proper centrally-organised clearing system <e> <s> the exchange has persistently refused to join the international commodities clearing house which has been owned for some time by the united kingdom clearing banks and provides a similar system for the soft commodity markets <e> <s> what does that say to the noble lord about the virtues of self-regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first echo the previous comments of noble lords about the distinction of the maiden speeches which the house has heard this afternoon <e> <s> i am sure that all three noble lords concerned will in the future make a very great contribution to the debates in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down do i understand that he is prepared to concede the principle of an inquiry or inquiries after the negotiations have been completed <e> <s> i deliberately put that phrase in because as i said earlier in my speech i do not wish to complicate the process of negotiation <e> <s> once that has been done i think the house would like to see an inquiry go ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord beswick has done us a great service in tabling this motion for short debate <e> <s> he is quite right in his assertion that the commercial banking system has been creating money in a somewhat uncontrolled <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord obrien for his intervention <e> <s> that is exactly the term in which i used the expression the policy being that the monetary weapon can do the whole job without accompanying fiscal policy or even physical controls <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne for his intervention <e> <s> i hope i did not say that the government had no means of control over the sterling m or whatever other monetary variable it might be <e> <s> the point i was making was that the method of control was by acting on the demand side rather than the supply side <e> <s> that is to say you choke off with the demand for money by high interest rates rather than controlling the supply <e> <s> if you want to control the supply then you get into problems with monetary base control which is another problem altogether with which i did not deal <e> <s> following on this question of the reliability of monetary statistics mr peter bull of the banks financial statistics division found flaws in nearly all the monetary dials which until quite recently formed the basis of policy planning <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> would he be kind enough to say something about my remarks on mo and the reliability of government financial statistics <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that the last review of institutions in the competition sector was in by the so-called liesner committee which was published in the form of a green paper and that there has been no review since then of those institutions <e> <s> in view of his noble friends question is it not about time that we had a formal review to see whether we can rationalise the procedure further <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining the substance of the draft order <e> <s> we on this side of the house do not intend to oppose the order because it seems to be fairly straightforward <e> <s> on the other hand i should like to make one or two points of a relatively minor nature and of which the noble lord might like to take account <e>", "<cs> my lords not litres <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord clarify two points <e> <s> before asking my questions may i say that i very much regret the attitude of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe in respect of the suggestion of my noble friend lord barnett that the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i perhaps help the noble lord by putting some figures on the categories that the noble lord lord grimond has mentioned in his original question <e> <s> inflation is at per cent <e> <s> chairmen and directors according to the institute of directors up per cent <e> <s> top management up depending on whether you believe charterhouse <e> <s> inbucon or hay-msl between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> and the top salaries review board up per cent <e> <s> in the light of these figures can the noble lord perhaps give a more considered reply to some of the questions that have been raised in this house this afternoon or are we to be told again that the top people can have their bread but the peasants are invited to eat cake <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in his answer he has given support to the labour party position which is that we should have a national balance sheet as i think the noble lord lord wolfson implied and the public sector borrowing requirement should be projected in the function of that balance sheet <e> <s> is he also aware that we in our party are grateful to him for his support for that concept <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will pay attention to what the noble lord said and that he will be able to give us those assurances <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand in this latest instance of government intervention in the markets that a european solution is to be favoured over an american solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am particularly grateful to my noble friend lord gallacher for tabling this motion for short debate <e> <s> it has been welcome to see how on all sides of the house he has had support for some of his propositions and indeed what degree of unanimity there is on all sides of the house about what needs to be done <e> <s> debates on competition policy are few and far between partly because the subject matter tends to be rather dry and technical and partly because the issues of controversy that exist do not necessarily cause great political collisions and therefore are not an object of political controversy but they are none the less controversial <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> it is true that the monopolies and mergers commission can recommend to the secretary of state and the secretary of state can make an order on companies where the monopolies and mergers commission find something wrong <e> <s> it is extremely rare in my experience in fact i cannot cite any cases when the monopolies and mergers commission have cleared a merger and even <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> will he kindly tell us whether the director general looked at the westland case which after all fell within his remit as a partial merger <e> <s> did he make any recommendations to the secretary of state on that subject <e> <s> if so what did the secretary of state do with those recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords if as the noble lord claims the government have no wages policy and hence no policy of restraint on wages can he tell us by what logic wage settlements can be regarded as excessive and why ministers keep on trying to talk down wage settlements <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us what the non-oil growth rate was during that period <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us whether there has been any change in the velocity of circulation as a result of the issuance of the new coins as opposed to the old note and whether any such change has had an effect on the governments favourite monetary variable mo <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the ministers comments can he tell the house when he expects the output of industry to be higher than it was in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the right reverend prelate the bishop of rochester a question on part iii of the ecclesiastical fees measure clause <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord very kindly give us figures for public investment which is a major component of public spending calculated as a percentage of the gross domestic product as he requests for the periods that my noble friend lord molloy refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to return to the dispatch box but perhaps i can help the noble lord <e> <s> public investment on the national accounts basis percentage of gross domestic product in was per cent <e> <s> in it is estimated to be per cent <e> <s> in real terms public investment is estimated to decline by nearly per cent <e> <s> will the noble lord please accept for once that the cuts in investment have bitten deepest in public investment where the national need is greatest <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for that response <e> <s> in view of the substantial decline in oil prices since the autumn statement and hence the projected shortfall of revenue in both this financial year and more importantly the next will the noble lord kindly tell us whether the government have any policy towards the oil price and if so what it is and whether they have any corresponding policy towards the exchange rate and if so what that is <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> will he not agree that the powers in the companies act which he has just cited are rather blockbuster powers and that a mechanism is required to discover the real ownership of shares such as may determine for instance the outcome of the westland case or where holdings may be built up in strategic industries by and through nominee names <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that the opening offer price made by general motors for the commercial vehicle division was zero on the grounds that if there were any value in the business it would be eroded by the cost of redundancies which it estimates at million <e> <s> furthermore will the noble lord tell the house who are the professional advisers acting for the government and for british leyland in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord ezra in saying that this debate has come at a particularly opportune moment <e> <s> since november we have had a preview of what i would call and i mean no disrespect to the noble lord lord aldington the aldington nightmare in which declining north sea oil production produces a <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us when the terms of reference of this review will be published and how long he expects this review to take <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for his response which does indeed echo the terms of the white paper <e> <s> in the event of commercial failure of the project from whatever cause and one can think of many that might intervene would the government let the project go as normal into liquidation would there be no government bail-out and would we therefore be left with perhaps two or four holes in the ground <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell us how brazil and argentina in those two cases are going to pay for the arms given their present financial situation <e>", "<cs> my lords in giving primacy to the competition criterion in references to the monopolies and mergers commission are not the government encouraging conglomerate takeovers and discouraging proper industrial concentration <e> <s> unless the government can show that conglomerates can manage assets better than other people what is the sense in that policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his response <e> <s> i am sure that the whole house will deplore the inability of the members of the international tin council to live up fully to their obligations <e> <s> however is it not the case that the bank of england informed the noble lords department many months before the crisis broke that the tin councils position was becoming untenable and that his department did nothing about it <e> <s> what legal advice have the government received on whether the obligations of the signatories to the tin agreement are joint and several or only several in the sense that if it is joint and several we shall be liable for all the obligations of the international tin agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords can i press the noble lord a little further for an answer to my supplementary question on the matter of the legal advice that the government are receiving <e> <s> the sums of money involved are enormous million immediate debts and possibly billion in terms of compensation <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that banks are claiming that the obligation of signatories under this agreement is joint and several <e> <s> it does not matter which jurisdiction we are talking about it will be fought in whatever jurisdiction is convenient to the banks <e> <s> what legal advice are the government receiving on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not also a separate problem in that the iranian national oil company is established in this country as a trader in hydrocarbon products <e> <s> if the offices of this company are being used for other purposes then the declarations that are made to the inland revenue in that respect may well be false <e> <s> would the noble lord therefore agree that the inland revenue itself has powers under the income and corporation taxes act to investigate this company particularly in respect of business expenses if that activity is being carried on <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope not to detain your lordships very long <e> <s> it is quite right of the noble lord lord teviot to raise this matter in his unstarred question <e> <s> i have had a slight disappointment because at one stage in his speech i had hoped that we would have a debate about the relative merits of south sea islands and holiday packages but i find that we now come to the rather narrow issue of the dispute between abta and the bcc which is the point on which the noble lord concentrated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord teviot for his intervention <e> <s> indeed that is the case <e> <s> i was talking as a matter of general principle <e> <s> i think i said that if generally across the board there were any such failure and i am not claiming that there was abta would be the people who would be regarded certainly by the media as being the governing association and i think quite properly the chief executive of abta would be required to answer the questions of newspaper and television reporters <e>", "<cs> my lords given the noble lords oft-repeated concern at the current rate of unemployment which i shall accept as genuine at least until i hear the answer to my question and given that the chancellor after the fall in oil prices and by his own arithmetic has allocated billion for tax cuts does the noble lord genuinely believe that the most effective use of those funds to reduce the unemployment level is to cut p off the basic rate of income tax <e>", "<cs> my lords if as the noble lord says the index has declined by per cent <e> <s> of input costs why is it that manufacturers output costs are still rising <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his response <e> <s> is he aware that vice-president bush of the united states has recently gone on record to the effect that if the oil price stabilised at dollars a barrel or less the united states government would be forced to intervene to rescue certain financial institutions in the united states which in his words would be badly hurt <e> <s> do the government feel the same responsibility toward uk financial institutions which would be similarly badly hurt and will the government not join with vice-president bush in seeking ways of stabilising oil prices so as to protect the world financial system from the danger of collapse <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to the baker plan <e> <s> do the government really genuinely believe that the baker plan is still alive and that it will still work <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion before your lordships which has been so ably moved by my noble friend lord bruce of donington has come at a very opportune moment <e> <s> as many noble lords have remarked during the debate it is part of a continuing discussion which we have been having in your lordships house indeed which is being maintained in other places about the future when we come to the end of north sea oil <e> <s> what we are witnessing in one form or another is the beginning of the end of the north sea oil bonanza <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak at the moment of course for myself but i believe that i will speak for my party in the future <e> <s> yes i think that we <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> we have to recognise that there is a complete difference of opinion between the noble lord and myself and indeed my party <e> <s> it is clear as the noble lord himself put it that there are strong opinions held on this <e> <s> i do not believe that what he says is true in france in japan or even in germany <e> <s> i do not believe that what he says is true in the united states <e> <s> we have to be in the area of a mixed economy <e> <s> i have no doubt that there is a majority among your lordships for this type of solution <e> <s> i have no doubt that there would be a majority in another place to unite behind the government if they adopted this sort of solution <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start by declaring a small conflict of interest <e> <s> i am chairman of a company called barclay exploration and production plc which is a small company exploring in the north sea <e> <s> it is a very minor company in the context of the company we are discussing but i feel i have to put it before your lordships as a possible conflict partly because this company would hope to become a supplier in the future to whatever authority is set up under this new legislation and partly because in view of the remarks of the noble lord lord ezra i feel this company might easily be gobbled up by the british gas corporation once it is in a position to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give us figures for the visible non-oil trade balance between the united kingdom and west germany over the past three years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back again to the noble lord but i asked for the visible trade balance which of course includes imports as well as exports <e>", "<cs> i speak as my noble friend lord stoddart of swindon said as the only person in your lordships chamber who has actually sat across the table from the chairman of the gas corporation in an investigatory capacity <e> <s> as i mentioned in my speech on second reading when i was chairman of the price commission we produced a major report on british gas corporation gas prices and allied charges <e> <s> this involved a great deal of hard work and study <e> <s> i say this in order to illustrate not only that i have some experience in this field of regulation but also to make the point that at that time our relations in the price commission with sir dennis rooke and the gas board were extremely cordial <e> <s> they were extremely tough but very cordial negotiations and i have absolutely no complaint to make about the way sir dennis rooke and his colleagues comported themselves <e> <s> i found them very expert but very tough and very concerned to press their point of view <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has not addressed the point of the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> nobody is asking for a select committee of this house to make the appointment <e> <s> the amendment specifically refers to consultation <e> <s> if i may go back some years to my appointment as chairman of the price commission as commissar i think the noble lord referred to it at an earlier stage this afternoon it was not done in consultation with anybody <e> <s> i know how these appointments are made <e> <s> the civil service comes up with a list of names <e> <s> the list of names is known throughout whitehall <e> <s> certain names are chosen for good or for bad reasons <e> <s> then somebody comes along and selects the appropriate name <e>", "<cs> i want to make two points very briefly <e> <s> first of all this is the last amendment as i understand it which deals with possible parliamentary control or influence on the appointment of the director at this stage of the proceedings in committee <e> <s> once we pass this amendment we then get on to different matters <e> <s> if the amendment is not accepted we then lose it seems the ability of parliament to influence the appointment of the director <e>", "<cs> i just want to join with my noble friend lord bruce of donington briefly and repeat something that i said in an earlier intervention this afternoon <e> <s> i believe that i am the only member of the committee who has run a regulatory authority and who has had the opportunity to have the sort of discussion that i think a future director will have with the chairman of british gas <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord able to tell us today exactly what are the obligations of individual member governments under the international tin agreement whether the obligations are joint and several or merely several and what is the total potential liability of the united kingdom government under that agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord accept that his analogy with other industries is quite false and that for over years the tin agreement has been designed to keep the prices in the market different from those which would prevail in the free market <e> <s> does he agree that the collapse of the tin agreement in october as he rightly said created a completely new situation which had not been faced by other industries <e> <s> in the light of that would he not agree that there is a case for some transitional arrangements to allow the cornish tin industry to adjust to a totally new market situation which has developed only in the last few months <e>", "<cs> there is one further point which perhaps the noble viscount has not made <e> <s> if you take consequentially periods of five years after a long period of time you will reach years which i understand is the period of the authorisation <e> <s> i hope that the minister will agree that it is undesirable for the appointment of any director to be coterminous with the end of an authorisation and that he has to straddle a reauthorisation <e> <s> that is why we ask the minister either to clarify that that will not be the case or to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too shall not detain your lordships very long <e> <s> i must express the gratitude of the opposition to the noble lord lord birdwood for raising this question because it is a question of the technology of the future and also a question of what government could or should be doing to support the development of technology <e> <s> at the outset i must say that we on this side of the house take fully the point made by the noble lord lord birdwood that you cannot be the man in the middle of this technology <e> <s> you have to have the full range otherwise you will be dominated by the man who stands in the middle and you will be in an inferior position compared with your competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> indeed there are companies that are making an investment but the message of the coupland report and of the noble lord lord birdwood is crystal clear <e> <s> i doubt whether your lordships can get away from it <e> <s> that investment is a drop in the ocean compared with what is really required to realise this market which may be of the order of billion dollars a year or may be of the order of billion dollars a year <e> <s> that is a matter to be determined in the future <e> <s> the investment actually being made is really no more than a small drop compared to what is required <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one more point on which i should like the noble lord lord brabazon to comment and that is the expenditure recommended in the coupland report <e> <s> on page of <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble minister for his response to this amendment <e> <s> before accepting his offer to take this away so that it max be further studied by the government perhaps i may refer him to notes on clauses and in particular to the comment on subsection <e> <s> perhaps i may quote it verbatim <e> <s> it refers to clause and says <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord tell the committee who will be the accounting officer for the gas consumers council <e>", "<cs> i find this a most interesting amendment <e> <s> i am afraid that we on this side of the committee may be trespassing somewhat on a family feud between those on the opposite side who wish to see the conservative party manifesto put into action and those who do not wish the conservative party manifesto of put into action <e> <s> as i understand it the amendments purpose is to suggest an improved form of privatisation <e> <s> in other words the movers of the amendment the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne was very clear on second reading that he took this view feel that the way in which the government are setting about this privatisation is an unsatisfactory one <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord could reflect on one or two points that he has made in his reply <e> <s> in the united states of america the buy america act is very influential indeed predominent in the purchasing policy of utilities <e> <s> it was not very long ago that one of the texan utilities tried to buy a transformer from outside the united states <e> <s> it was effectively not allowed to do so and was required to go to westinghouse for its transformer <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that in its note to the national economic development council the treasury pointed out that the definition of profit-linked income would have to go down as far as the business and profit centre <e> <s> if so will he agree that this procedure involves the publication to interested parties like employees of disaggregated profit and loss statements for businesses and profit centres <e> <s> will he accept that this goes far beyond the present practice and present requirement <e> <s> will he also agree that some noble lords opposite might well worry about the ability of management to manage in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister tell us whether it is the governments intention to privatise the north of scotland hydro-electric board <e>", "<cs> may i answer the two points raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and in so doing answer one point raised by the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> there is no attempt at all to rewrite the companies act in this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter pointed out directors have responsibilities under that legislation and clearly this is not the place to reconsider that legislation <e> <s> any director who may represent employees is bound by the companies legislation and will continue to be bound by the companies legislation and this amendment is not designed to change that <e> <s> nevertheless there is a case in the context of that companies legislation for having as the noble lord lord auckland said somebody on the board or some people on the board who may represent the interests of the employees <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord tordoff would agree with that <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl saying that the british telecom arrangements will be duplicated and that employees will be subsidised to take up shareholdings <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble earl whether he will consider the possibility of having an employees trust the beneficiaries of which are the employees because i do not think his remarks exactly responded to the point i was making <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> will he respond to the point made by his noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that if a foreign operator gained a predominant position in one of these airports it might by lack of investment let it run down to the detriment of that airport versus the european competition <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed with the noble earls reply as i am sure he will recognise <e> <s> i did not expect to get a party-political blast as a result of these amendments <e> <s> we are not asking for the noble earl to write the conservative party manifesto into the bill <e> <s> all we are asking is for continuing reports on what goes on <e> <s> after all as my noble friend lord underhill said earlier this is the first major country which is to have a privatised airport system <e> <s> it seems only right that parliament should be informed by the responsible authority which at the end of the day is the secretary of state on a continuing basis on how that is going <e>", "<cs> in the light of the noble earls remarks i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to the noble earl for giving us the explanation of the clause <e> <s> am i right in thinking it may be a slip of the tongue that he was referring to clause as being the enabling measure which allows the secretary of state to acquire securities rather than clause which is entitled <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl and i am sorry to take up the committees time <e> <s> but if we can just concentrate on the debt equity ratio i can fully understand that the government wish to have a proper capital structure of the successor company and that they rightly wish to redeem for themselves the money that they have lent from the national loans fund <e> <s> that i understand perfectly <e> <s> what i am worried about is the total amount of money that the government are to accept in securities of the successor company versus the total amount of loans from the national loans fund <e> <s> whether the total in privatised securities are in debentures convertible debentures preferred shares or shares does not seem to affect the issue <e> <s> as the noble earl quite rightly says it is a question of the debt equity ratio <e> <s> i am talking about the total amounts and perhaps he would address himself to that <e>", "<cs> may i help to resolve the noble earls confusion <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble earl lord dudley has moved a perfectly serious and sensible drafting amendment <e> <s> he complains i think rightly that the existing clause in the bill is too restrictive and the expression in line on page which in fact stops local authorities from presenting a scheme which is in some circumstances going to be more flexible than the bill would allow <e>", "<cs> in responding to these amendments the noble earl described them as superficially attractive and also wrecking <e> <s> if it is indeed superficially attractive to wreck the bill who am i to quarrel with the noble earl the minister <e> <s> however i think he has underestimated the force of the argument behind in particular amendment no <e> <s> and the consequential amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i very much hope that he will look at this again <e>", "<cs> did the noble earl make his last remark in the light of clause or not <e>", "<cs> we shall come to this on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is a question of clause and the restrictions on companies <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just add a short word to what the noble viscount has said <e> <s> the amendment calls for the secretary of state who presumably is responsible across the range of these various fuels <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> i do not dissociate myself at all from the views of my noble friends and if i may say so the noble lord the minister is being slightly mischievous in suggesting that i was doing so <e> <s> i was trying to concentrate the ministers mind on a particularly narrow point in order to help him with his thinking which seems sometimes to be somewhat diffuse <e> <s> i was concentrating his thinking on the point made by the noble baroness lady seear and i was trying to focus that on advertising and marketing as between a public company a plc and a nationalised industry <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord belstead when he was replying to an amendment concerning the functions of the director referred the committee to notes on clauses and particularly to annex a in the notes on clause spelling out the duties of the director <e> <s> some members of the committee on this side were not entirely happy that the duties of the director should be relegated to an annex in notes on clauses which so far as we can see has no particular legal validity <e> <s> therefore the thought which i think is a proper and sensible thought emerged that the noble lord might consider putting the duties of the director fairly and squarely in the bill rather than relegating them to an annex in notes on clauses <e> <s> i think we should support this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his reply <e> <s> i wonder whether i could ask him to reply to the second point that i made in speaking to this amendment <e> <s> i understand that notifications are made and that the secretary of state has to process them that is quite proper <e> <s> i also understand that the secretary of state has to take all sorts of factors into account <e> <s> the point that i am really stressing is that notifications may be made by companies which form part of a group <e> <s> for all sorts of reasons nothing to do with the company which is making the notification other parts of the group may get into financial problems and drag with them the notifier <e> <s> this is the problem i am afraid i may have put it badly at the time i moved the amendment that i am trying to get at <e> <s> the secretary of state should take into account in considering notifications the financial <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord help me on one point <e> <s> in his response he said that in considering those who had notified were in a position to notify would or might become gas suppliers or are gas suppliers under this clause the secretary of state would presumably i think he used the word presumably consider the other companies of a group of which such a gas supplier might or might not be a member <e> <s> if the noble lord can remove the word presumably and give us the assurance that the secretary of state would consider the circumstances of other members of a group that would meet our point <e>", "<cs> i fail to see the problem that the noble lord the minister has in giving us an assurance that the secretary of state and the director would look at other

greatest respect is to address himself to the arguments that i put forward particularly in respect of the straitjacket and of including borrowing which at present is not part of the psbr into the psbr

friend lord graham <e> <s> these were of considerable importance <e> <s> i wonder whether he will also reassure me on one particular point <e> <s> in his original reply he said that the proposed authorisation that would become the authorisation contained a requirement to abide by a code of practice <e> <s> there have been a number of debates during the committee stage about how such authorisation might be modified <e> <s> i hope to have an assurance from the noble lord that one of the things least likely to be modified is the requirement to adhere to the code of practice <e> <s>

ems is compatible with our policies and the price of entry looks not unreasonable we are certainly not going to rule it out <e> <s> we would be much encouraged however if entry into erm and full membership of ems would be accompanied by a programme either of co-ordinated european expansion which has been much discussed or as my noble friend lord lever said if it were accompanied by some

explanation of the new clause <e> <s> he is right in saying that this amendment is already in the gas bill which is in committee of your lordships house and i hope your lordships will excuse me if

amendment that we shall be moving on the same clause more or less on the same subject <e>", "<cs> my lords did i hear the noble earl correctly <e> <s> i raise this question by way of clarification <e>

this <e>", "<cs> my lords how can you issue a share without selling the share <e> <s> i am trying to clarify the point <e> <s> clearly if there is a share issue someone has to buy the share <e> <s>

sold to foreigners or not <e> <s> it is an argument that has no relevance whatsoever <e> <s> nevertheless i do not think that the foreign ownership point is central to the point that i am making <e>", "<cs> i was most interested to hear from the noble lord that the government intended to make the british gas issue in a series of tranches <e> <s> this is not the time to pursue this point but he will be coming back to it on report because it is something which i think your lordships would wish to hear more about <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> will he kindly give me an

comments of mr lamfalussy the chairman of the bank for international settlements that the generalised fall in the inflation rate of the major industrial countries has been largely due to the very sharp fall in commodity prices including oil <e> <s> does he further agree that this fall has had a severe impact on the national income of commodity exporting countries <e> <s> does not the noble

services bill is not going to work successfully it seems to me that the powers should be strengthened <e>", "<cs> if i may respond to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter the idea running through this

future of building societies looking over a to year span <e> <s> my view is that the building societies and this relates to the debate that has just taken place on the question of premises will no longer be able to sustain the retail thrust that they <e>", "<cs> as the noble lords knows we are a party of very rich contrasts <e> <s> we can adopt <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his response <e> <s> i understand and i am grateful to him for the clarification that amendments nos <e> <s> and are redundant because their substance is covered under the bill <e> <s> if i read the bill again and discover other methods of financing which are not covered i shall certainly write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak to amendment no <e> <s> if the noble lord is going to move the amendments separately <e> <s> i tried to follow the noble lord lord skelmersdale in what he was saying about amendment no <e> <s> which is the substantive amendment <e> <s> i am not sure that i fully followed him but no doubt i shall be able to read tomorrow in <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister to comment briefly on a matter that i raised on second reading concerning what i called much to the objection of some noble lords securitised mortgages <e> <s> we are talking here about advances made by building societies <e> <s> our concern is that advances may be in the form that will allow them to be tradeable <e> <s> if that is not the case and if the bill as drafted and as enacted prohibits or inhibits such action then i shall be perfectly happy with a ministerial assurance that that is so <e> <s> however if the bill does not then it raises a whole host of questions as to the circumstances in which such advances might be sold on to a third party and under what conditions that might be done <e> <s> i shall be grateful if the minister will give the committee an indication of what the bill says on that topic <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord give the committee a rough timetable as to when those discussions will be brought to fruition <e> <s> it is as he will be aware a matter of enormous importance not only in the context of what building societies can do with their assets but also to the public <e> <s> it would be unwise for the committee to consider this bill as complete until we have received some response to the outcome of the discussions <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may raise a point for clarification because this is the first time that we have really had a look at these amendments <e> <s> the amendment says <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for reading out the rest of his brief on this amendment <e> <s> i shall have to look at <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that response <e> <s> i understand that building societies are not meant to be money funds or anything else other than building societies but i still have a problem about this <e> <s> what happens if involuntarily a building society finds itself in a position where its liquid assets are per cent <e> <s> of the total balance sheet <e> <s> it may be that they can do nothing about this and it simply happens because the timing of loans has gone wrong or it may have been engaged in a money market operation or have raised wholesale funds and has to keep those funds in cash balances <e> <s> it seems rather extraordinary to put a limitation of such a precise amount without apparently having any way of granting exceptions to building societies who may find themselves temporarily in breach of this regulation <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord the minister can help me <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he is right in saying that it is only part of the answer <e> <s> these things happen very suddenly and the commission may not be in a position to grant that sort of notice <e> <s> if he can write to me shedding further light on this aspect i should be most grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i understand the thrust of these amendments and there is no particular problem although i should like to have a look in <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but here i must part company with the minister <e> <s> if you hedge for the avoidance of risk of loss you hedge to make a profit <e> <s> there is no difference in practice between the two <e> <s> i do not understand how this wording covers the point that i was making <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord plummer who has great experience can help <e> <s> i do not agree with the minister <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord and to the noble lord lord plummer for his intervention which was very well taken <e>", "<cs> i note what the noble lord said <e> <s> i understand that it is perhaps not fair to ask him to be more specific at this point and at this stage of the bill <e> <s> i hope very much that we may be able to make a little more progress on this which i think is an extremely important problem as i believe the noble lord recognises <e> <s> but in the light of what he has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i just say i am very pleased that the government are introducing these amendments because it is an important part of the armoury of the commission particularly when you get interest rate swaps in futures because these are dangerous areas <e> <s> so i certainly welcome these amendments <e>", "<cs> i understand that we are promised notes on these new amendments and i think that we must wait for those notes at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i congratulate the noble lord on having read through the schedule <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord strabolgi <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord elaborate on two points that he has made <e> <s> first he said that the protection was not in the financial services bill as at present drafted and as it will come to your lordships house <e> <s> is there no provision in the re-writing of the bill that i understand is at present taking place for putting it in the bill or in one of the schedules <e>", "<cs> when shall we have a sight of this amendment allowing building societies to deal in personal equity plans so that we can study it <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> will he assure us that in amendment no <e> <s> we are under the same principle that he announced when we were discussing the amendment moved by my noble friend lord houghton that the authority making the order would place this order before parliament through a treasury minister <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in recent days we have had several bills in this house which have sought to define the public interest for that particular purpose <e> <s> i refer for instance to the gas bill the airports bill and indeed other bills <e> <s> we are now in a state where the public interest to which the monopolies and mergers commission is required to address itself has several different definitions for several different purposes <e> <s> is it not right therefore that the review should decide where and how the public interest should be defined and that this should be properly codified <e>", "<cs> the noble lord in his reply to the amendment a reply with which incidentally i did not disagree pleaded in aid the powers of the office of fair trading the office having general supervision <e> <s> on previous occasions we have had in this chamber bills where the office of fair trading and competition law were pleaded in aid <e> <s> the question i would put to the noble lord is is he satisfied or will he give us an assurance that the office of fair trading will be adequately staffed to meet the extra demands that different bills are placing upon it <e>", "<cs> i should like to clarify one point of clause <e> <s> clause defines the determination notification and effect and the appeal procedures <e> <s> it seems to me that a situation could arise in which until the determination to ascertain a building societys powers has actually been made it is not realised by the society or by anybody that a certain activity is outside the powers of the society <e> <s> i should <e>", "<cs> may i raise a question on clause with the leave of the committee <e> <s> again this refers to the power to direct application to renew an authorisation <e> <s> when we look at clause it will be noted that the commission may direct a society to apply to renew its authorisation if the commission has reason to believe that the societys business is or may be being conducted in a way that may not adequately protect the investors <e> <s> as far as i can see there is no machinery for appeal against such a direction <e> <s> there is a right of appeal against a subsequent refusal to grant renewal of authorisation but this would involve a society having to go through the process of renewing its application for authorisation which it would not have to do if the original direction to apply for renewal were wrongly made <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord the minister specifically concentrate on the point whether or not in addition there should be a right of appeal against a direction requiring a society to apply for renewal of its authorisation <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord morris for his advice but i am <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister and i apologise to the committee for being somewhat provoked by the noble lord lord morris into intervening at an improper time <e> <s> but i am perfectly satisfied that the government will take all possible measures to make sure that the membership of the tribunal is fair independent and as the noble lord said perfectly objective <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for speaking to so many amendments at the same time and also for explaining so clearly exactly what is the thrust of the amendments <e> <s> i understand the problem the government have got themselves into that they are creating a number of supervisory bodies in all directions and some of those supervisory bodies have not yet come before this chamber officially so that we do not know what their powers are going to be or indeed what noble lords may decide their powers should be in the future <e> <s> so i reserve our position on these amendments until we have gone through the relevant legislation particularly the financial services bill and can see exactly how noble lords think the supervisory bodies should perform <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> when he replied to i think the noble lord lord foot on the first amendment that the committee discussed this afternoon he mentioned that competition law was adequate to deal with certain circumstances <e> <s> i took him to mean by competition law that it would be the intervention and i think he specified the intervention of the office of fair trading and eventually should that take place a reference to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> i am grateful for his answer and i do not wish to press him too far but is he satisfied that the case that he mentioned in his reply to the noble lord lord foot is covered by his answer and that the office of fair trading would have adequate information coming from the privileged sources under this bill to take action <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it appears that advice has not arrived magically from a certain quarter and therefore i shall rely on the noble lords assurance that he will be communicating with me in due course <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> this is what comes of having civil servants who are able to brief you rather than not having civil servants <e> <s> the noble lord has explained the position quite clearly and i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i find the ministers reply wholly unsatisfactory <e> <s> first i know of no case where a co-opted director has not been elected at a subsequent agm <e> <s> that is the normal procedure with companies where a co-opted director goes for re-election to the agm <e> <s> i myself have been co-opted to the boards of a number of companies and i see my noble friends nodding at this and i have never been rejected at the subsequent agm having been co-opted and having come forward with the recommendation of the <e>", "<cs> it has been an interesting debate <e> <s> i am bound to say that i am glad the noble lords lord plummer and lord campbell of croy intervened <e> <s> they are of course chairmen or directors <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord could help us on one point <e> <s> what exactly is the definition of a justified estimate <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his presentation of the amendments and also for the fact that he referred to the amendments standing in the name of my noble friend lord barnett and myself amendment nos <e> <s> and to which i can perhaps also refer <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i did not quite catch his reference <e> <s> was it clause of the bill in which he said the commission has powers to look at audit <e> <s> i wonder whether he would kindly refresh my memory on that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord i have found it <e> <s> the problem is that this clause deals with the disclosure of information <e> <s> i fully understand that if disciplinary procedures are to be taken against an auditor a commission under this clause to which the noble lord has referred the committee is entitled to disclose information <e> <s> what the clause does not do and in my view there should be some provision in the bill that this should happen is to allow the commission to intervene where it feels that an audit is unsatisfactory or that an accounting firm needs to be complemented as the noble lord said by a second accounting firm <e> <s> the noble lord may be able to point me to another part of the bill where that can happen <e> <s> if there is no place in the bill where it happens i hope very much that the noble lord will consider this point and perhaps bring it back at report stage <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> it is very important from our point of view <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will recognise that <e> <s> in the light of what has been said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it is a difficult point <e> <s> i fully accept that the best auditing firms send a management letter each year which describes what the audit firm sees as being wrong with the internal control <e> <s> i use the expression best auditors <e> <s> it is by no means universal practice <e> <s> it is done by the best auditors <e> <s> i have been in receipt of many management letters in my time and i know that they are penetrating and sensible documents <e>", "<cs> i understand the noble lords last point <e> <s> i hope that the professions will take it into account <e> <s> in my last words i was paraphrasing the words of the former chairman of the accounting standards committee of the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales <e> <s> in the light of what the noble lord has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that explanation <e> <s> i hope that i heard him aright when he said that the commission would be issuing a guidance note which would contain the principles which we are attempting to embody through this amendment <e> <s> i am grateful for that information and on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am again grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he has the advantage over me in that he has knowledge of certain guidance notes that are undoubtedly going to be sent out which i do not have <e> <s> i accept that if there is in some guidance note a general principle that the auditors should discuss these questions and i think the noble lord said verify their points before they send the report off to the commission that is tantamount to consultation and so i have no particular problem with that <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble lords construction of the word consultation means quite what he says but that is a matter of semantics <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord brabazon of tara is quite right when he says that he has drawn the short straw <e> <s> these amendments and the issues they raise have been the subject of intense debate in the press and elsewhere for a number of months now indeed ever since the johnson matthey affair and the chancellors committee of inquiry which was set up after that event and reported last august <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that there is a very serious difference of opinion between myself and the noble lord lord brabazon of tara <e> <s> he says in his justification of these amendments that they are a reserve power but perhaps i may just read to the committee what is said in amendment no <e> <s> in subsection which is to be inserted <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i misunderstood the noble lord <e> <s> i understood him to say that the whole amendment was a reserve power because he preferred to have the professions setting out their own guidelines and that it was only if they tailed to do that that these arrangements would be invoked <e> <s> i hope that i have not misunderstood the noble lord on that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful <e> <s> i understand that and i know what happens to orders when they come before parliament under the annulment procedure <e> <s> nevertheless i think that they are reserve powers and i think that the noble lord said that he hoped very much and the government hoped very much that the professions would sort it out themselves <e> <s> we should like the professions to be left to sort it out for themslves <e> <s> in case i seem too academic to my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby i would say that i really feel that this is something on which my noble friend and i would agree and that if i appear academic it does not mean to say that i do not feel very strongly about it <e> <s> i would continue to oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining what these amendments are about <e> <s> however i cannot quite see the purpose <e> <s> can he explain to us why these amendments need to be put down and what is the reason for them <e>", "<cs> it does help to clarify the position i think <e> <s> however it raises all sorts of other questions <e> <s> we have had our debate on the whole question of whether building societies should be allowed to convert to plcs <e> <s> if the noble lord is now saying that there are a number of oversights in the bill as originally drafted which would tend to encourage a speculative flow of funds if there is to use his words a rumour that a building society might convert into a plc presumably there will be a much greater speculative flow when a building society decides that it is going to turn itself into a plc <e> <s> as we all know the waiting period of two years before you can get your cash distribution is a relatively short time <e> <s> i wonder whether this oversight in the bill is now corrected <e> <s> i wonder not that i am encouraging further government amendments whether there should not be further government study on exactly how this transition is going to take place <e> <s> i think that this is an extremely difficult problem <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to quarrel with the substance of the amendment but i find it rather extraordinary that we have got to the committee stage in your lordships house having gone through the whole procedure in another place and we have an inconsistency in this bill which has to be rectified by a technical amendment at this stage <e> <s> i will not oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am always delighted with the noble lords clarifications <e> <s> i only wish that they had come a little earlier in the stages of the bill <e>", "<cs> i understand that this is in the notes with which we have been provided and is regarded as a technical amendment <e> <s> indeed the noble lord repeated that it was a technical amendment <e> <s> i am not sure that it is entirely as technical as the noble lord and indeed the notes make out <e> <s> here we are talking about the value to be placed on an investors shareholding for example on a members entitlement to vote on resolutions <e> <s> the building societies association i understand reading from the notes with which the noble lord kindly provided me is broadly content with this definition but the fact that it is broadly content may give rise to some controversy <e> <s> if it is a question of the building societies association being broadly content this is clearly not a technical amendment but an amendment of some substance <e> <s> am i right or wrong <e>", "<cs> not to me <e>", "<cs> i understood that the noble lord might be speaking also to amendments nos <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would like to reconsider what he has said in the light of what i have put down in amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> it seems to me that these refer to treasury powers to make transitional and saving provisions under the act <e> <s> is that what the noble lord was speaking to <e> <s> i did not quite understand <e>", "<cs> i am very glad that the noble lord lord skelmersdale has had his thoughts so concentrated on these points <e> <s> it seems to me that in amendment no <e> <s> if i may speak to it there are some very substantial powers being given to the treasury on the provisional arrangements <e> <s> although at this late stage i do not want to oppose these amendments i think we must recognise that these are not inconsiderable powers and i think the committee should be aware of that <e>", "<cs> i should like to study in <e>", "<cs> may i thank the noble lord lord brabazon for the way in which he has handled the committee on behalf of the government and also the noble lord lord skelmersdale for the courtesy that he has extended to us <e> <s> i wish also to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for spending so much time on what was a most interesting debate <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord did not think that we on the opposition front bench had taken trappist vows <e> <s> we did not wish to intervene on a subject that was the concern of expertise other than our own <e>",

accounting firm which will no doubt be involved in this legislation as it goes through <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i should like to support the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> in his amendment <e>

had discussion of what might be coming before a committee of your lordships house by way of amendments to these various arrangements that are at present set out in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness could interpret the words circumstances are such as may be prescribed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord banks and my noble friend lady turner of camden in asking firstly who is being consulted on the question of what is a reasonable period when these consultations will come to fruition and whether we shall know this before third reading and secondly to pick up a point made by the noble lord lord banks are those who are in possession of a deferred pension in an occupational pension scheme ruled out from this provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness can explain the true purpose of this amendment because i am bound to say that i have some difficulty in understanding it <e> <s> if i heard what she said correctly and interpreted it correctly the member of an occupation pension scheme or any other scheme including the state scheme who has an entitlement to a benefit which increases with the gross national product as i <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may accept the kind offer of the noble baroness to write to me about this saying exactly what it does mean <e>", "<cs>

great problem <e> <s> i note that the noble baroness lady trumpington did not reply to my question about the treatment of holders of deferred pensions which i asked earlier <e> <s> these are the early leavers to whom the noble lord lord banks refers <e> <s> i think that the government ought to think rather carefully about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name

the chancellor of the exchequer was doing no more than talking in the air <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the secretary of state reaffirm that it is government policy and i quote from the medium-term financial strategy of that there is no question of departing from money supply policy which is essential to the success of any anti-inflationary strategy <e> <s> is this the policy of the government or is it not <e> <s> if this is the policy of the government will the noble lord please answer my original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for my voice but i am suffering from a cold <e> <s> i think i have to declare an interest because i am a financial adviser to christ church oxford which as the right reverend prelate will know is a substantial holder of patronages <e> <s>

consequential upon certain other things that have happened <e> <s> however i cannot let the occasion pass without objecting yet again to the expression british national overseas <e> <s> however i am not going to oppose the amendments simply for that objection which is an objection of principle and not an objection that relates to this particular bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for his succinct and clear explanation of this draft order <e> <s> i am very glad to hear that its provisions are not to use his words as confusing as might at first appear

approval for this particular expenditure will be advanced as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for this concession <e> <s> in the context of these amendments

clarified at an earlier stage of the bill <e> <s> we shall not oppose it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby in respect of this amendment <e> <s> we expressed our concern at the committee stage on the whole question of the election of directors in building societies and a number of my noble friends made the point that to date the record of building societies in having full fair and free elections although maintained in most reputable societies in some societies was open to criticism <e> <s> we would like to see the vote take place in an absolutely clean manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i am somewhat disappointed at the noble lords reply as i am sure he understands <e> <s> it seems to us to be fundamental that this market should not

made <e> <s> i shall leave aside the question of personal equity plans and whether they are worth a row of beans <e> <s> my view is consistent with that of the chairman of the stock exchange who believes that they will not encourage anything at all they are not radical enough <e> <s> but i shall not comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby on this amendment <e> <s> it is in my view the mildest amendment that he could possibly have put down <e> <s> after all it only specifies nomination and it does not specify that the individual concerned the full-time employee should be representing employees because in our discussions on previous bills we have had a number of problems about employee directors that is directors who are seen to represent employees and not fulfill their duties under other parts of either the companys legislation or in this case this bill <e> <s> so the amendment that my noble friend has put down seems to me to avoid any of those problems <e> <s> it seems to me extremely mild extremely sensible and i hope that the government will be able to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i accept his view that we are on the same side of the fence as it were on this issue <e> <s> it is essential that interests of directors in these important societies with substantially

clarification of this <e> <s> may i take my time at the dispatch box asking for this information in the hope that advice can arrive from a certain quarter to clarify that issue <e>", "<cs> in that case would the noble lord consider extending this amendment at a later stage to include options on platinum and other precious metals which are indeed traded <e>", "<cs> i did not realise that the noble lord lord hacking was also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i perfectly understand the motives of the noble viscount lord colville of culross and his noble friend lord boardman in moving this amendment <e> <s> i fully understand that the bill as drafted poses a major problem in defining what is commercial and what is not commercial <e> <s> this is the problem that i referred to in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> which is bothering the london metal exchange and other dealers because the fact of the matter is that dealers whether in banks if i may say so to the noble lord

may intervene on this point <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord boardman that there is a problem here <e> <s> personally i am not entirely happy that his amendment actually deals with it and in that i join with the noble lord the minister <e> <s> nevertheless there is a problem <e> <s> i think one has to recognise the problem which is that one starts off with a clear commercial transaction

which perhaps the government may like to think about in the intervening period <e>", "<cs> this is a useful clarification which the government are putting forward <e> <s> i wonder whether there are further clarifications that are required on this particular paragraph paragraph of the schedule <e> <s> the noble lord has pointed out that a member of an occupational pension scheme has an interest in the investments held for the purposes of the scheme but such an interest should not be deemed in the words of his amendment to be an investment <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i am at a disadvantage here because we did not receive the governments groupings of this series of amendments <e> <s> i did not realise that the noble lord was going to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and which

stupidity rather than the drafting of the bill <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrupting <e> <s> i did not quite hear to which new clause the noble lord was referring <e> <s> can he refer us again to the new amendment <e>", "<cs> on the basis that the noble lord describes i think that we are perfectly happy to postpone discussion of these matters until a later stage <e> <s> i notice that on page of the marshalled list after clause there is something called listed money market institutions <e> <s> no doubt when we come to it we shall discuss what listed money market institutions means because some of us are in great doubt as to whether there is such a list and on what basis it is compiled <e> <s> but i agree with the noble lord that we will discuss this matter when the time comes <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene at this point but i do not think i understood from the noble lord and i am sure it was by omission rather than intention exactly what the definition of a connected person is for the purposes of this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord referred to connected persons in his presentation of this amendment <e> <s> i posed a number of questions about who is in the same group as whom and what are joint enterprises and the noble lords reply concerned connected persons <e> <s> i should be grateful if the minister could give us a definition as to what he means by connected persons <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord the minister but that is if i may say so an absolutely circular response <e> <s> originally when i realised that the noble lord was speaking to amendment no <e> <s> i asked the noble lord for the definition of a group in paragraph al <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord i had read that passage <e> <s> i should like to ask the same question as i asked before <e> <s> if a body corporate is part of a group in the sense as described on page i assume that it is a subsidiary of a company under the meaning of the companies act <e> <s> a subsidiary under the meaning of the companies act is either where the equity is over per cent <e> <s> held by the holding company or where the board of directors is controlled by a company <e> <s> those are the two definitions under the companies act <e> <s> my question is what happens when all these dealings take place by companies which may be part of the group for the purposes of this bill which may be per cent <e> <s> owned by a company but that company has power to appoint the whole board of directors or which may be per cent <e> <s> owned by a company <e> <s> what happens to the minorities <e> <s> are they treated fairly <e> <s> are there any guarantees <e> <s> what are the accounting provisions between one member of the group and another <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will not telephone me at home <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for indicating that he is prepared to consider represent-ations because this particular amendment seems to raise a number of problems <e> <s> he is quite right in saying that it is a very complex issue <e> <s> as i understand it if a private company is sold as to per cent <e>

it and if necessary vote upon it <e> <s> it is up to the government to take this back and have another look at it <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne that as it at present stands it

problem here and it is not simply a question of overlap <e> <s> it is a question of the number of sros if i may use that abbreviation in this early stage of the bill to which various people have to belong in order to satisfy the different criteria <e> <s> a number of people in the city of london are extremely worried that they may have to belong to a whole succession or series of sros <e> <s> if the government found some way of eliminating not only the overlap on investments but also the consequential overlap on belonging to sros and being able to conduct business in those investments i think the whole city would benefit <e> <s> i support the noble lord lord hacking in this amendment although i am bound to say i have problems with his wording <e> <s> the expression ancillary causes me difficulty <e>", "<cs> again i am grateful to the noble lord lord hacking for introducing this thought <e> <s> i suppose that there could be warrants to <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble lord can tell us whether the expression a joint enterprise will figure in any future version of this bill that the government may produce and whether it has any precedent in other companies legislation <e> <s> if so can he say what that precedent is and what it means or is it just an expression invented for the purposes of this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord hacking for raising this matter and to the noble lord lord lucas for his response <e> <s> i hope that he and his honourable friend will consult the london metal exchange which has a major problem with this part of the schedule <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he recognises that there is a problem in secondary legislation being produced which amends via the negative procedure the primary legislation which your lordships house is passing <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord lucas for his response and i am also most grateful to noble lords who have joined in this debate <e> <s> i am bound to say that i found the first intervention by the noble and learned lord lord denning rather more to my taste than his second intervention and i am sure that the noble and learned lord will understand why <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> perhaps i may speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and because i have no particular comments to offer on the amendments tabled by the noble viscount lord colville of culross <e> <s> the thrust of amendments nos <e> <s> and is as a result of a submission to us from the law society of scotland <e> <s> they adhere to the view that they

"<cs> i am now clear on what this means and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> we have had a very interesting debate <e> <s> the more the debate goes on the more matters of substance seem to arise out of what appeared originally to be an entirely semantic problem <e> <s> i think there is a problem of substance as to how guidance is to

reading that i am on the national board of a spanish bank <e> <s> that particular spanish bank has one branch in london and apparently finds itself having to join four sros for the different activities in which it engages <e> <s> that is the point which i wish to bring to the noble lords attention <e> <s> it seemed to be slightly unreason-able <e> <s> but having said that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for i find it admirably clear but it does not answer the point i was trying to make <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that there has been extensive correspon-dence between the chairman of the city capital markets committee and the noble lords honourable friend on the question of how insurance companies manage their investments <e> <s> his honourable friend in another place has indicated i think that there will be some form of letter or assurance under these arrange <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to discuss this question at whatever point the noble lord the minister seeks to discuss it <e> <s> in fact as he will notice i have put down another amendment to one of the schedules which seeks to achieve the same thing <e> <s> i am perfectly happy to discuss it when we reach amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i would only plead in my defence that these amendments are coming along at a very rapid rate and sometimes it is rather difficult to catch up with all the government amendments that are coming through <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt at this stage but did i also understand the noble lord to say that there was a subsequent government amendment tabled on similar lines as regards friendly societies as well as insurance companies <e>", "<cs> then with the leave of the committee i should like to discuss the question of the funds of friendly societies because i would make exactly the same arguments about friendly societies and the way they manage their funds <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for his words and in the light of his assurance that he will take this on board and that we will discuss it at a later stage of the bill i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to seek clarification on something which i am afraid i do not understand it is on clause <e>", "<cs> not quite <e> <s> i am sorry to come back to the noble lord <e> <s> does the noble lord mean that any operator of a scheme approved under clause in a community country can conduct any investment business as defined in schedule to the bill so long as it is <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i do not want to weary the committee with my argument but i shall summarise if i can the stage that we have reached <e> <s> i shall take the example of robeco which is a dutch unit trust <e> <s> as i understand it robeco would be recognised <e> <s> its operator would therefore be automatically authorised <e> <s> as a dutch unit trust robecos operator would be allowed to conduct investment business in connection with or for the purposes of robeco mv <e> <s> specifically in clause of the bill the government wish to place restrictions on the activities of authorised unit trust schemes in the united kingdom <e> <s> so the operator of a dutch unit trust <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if my expositior has been less clear than the minister requires <e> <s> i shall read in <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house express our gratitude to the noble lords lord brabazon and lord skelmersdale for the way they have conducted the proceedings on this bill <e> <s> it is an extremely complex measure and we have had some very interesting debates but we have always felt that we have had the best possible co-operation from the government front bench and i should like to record our appreciation of that fact <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for his response <e> <s> can we take it from what he said that such a provision will form part of the regulations that will be imposed <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for his response <e> <s> i accept that his explanation of what is in the bill as at present drafted is a requirement of european directives <e> <s> i think that i shall have to read what the noble and learned lord has said consider it and perhaps return to this whole question of how people who are authorised in the community to do certain things can be authorised either automatically or not or under certain circumstances in the united kingdom to do certain things <e> <s> this is a question to which we shall return at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lucas in introducing this seems to have presented us with a new bill <e> <s> i was grateful to him when he said that a consultative document on this schedule would be issued <e> <s> i hope that it will be issued before the report stage in your lordships house because we now have a completely new list in addition to other lists which are there under the banking act and other acts such as the companies act <e> <s> we have another list of money market institutions which the noble lord defined in rather broad-brush terms <e> <s> we on our side are interested to know exactly who qualifies for this list and what are the criteria for getting on this list because obviously membership of this list confers considerable benefits on those who are there <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his explanation <e> <s> i am sorry as he corrected me in my interpretation of what he said about a consultative document that gloom suddenly descended upon the chamber <e> <s> indeed gloom descended on me <e> <s> i had rather expected that we were to receive a document which would explain the details of all this <e> <s> however i am grateful for his assurance that he will consult other parties <e> <s> perhaps i can issue myself an invitation as one of those who might be consulted as i might have something constructive to offer <e>", "<cs> i am referring in particular to deals concluded on the commodity exchanges and particularly on the london metal exchange <e> <s> we do not know whether when the lme joins icch the contracts which will be dealt in outside what is known as the memo the -day basic contract which is dealt in on the ring will be cleared in a clearing house or not <e> <s> it seems to me that the clearing house may decide that although they are not dealt in on the ring they may well be part of the operations in the clearing house <e> <s> therefore the expression on the exchange is perhaps too narrow for that purpose <e> <s> this is what i had in mind but if the noble lord assures me that that will be covered then i am very happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for his response <e> <s> as i understand him he is saying in his typically clear manner that we shall be discussing miscellaneous exemptions and technical adjustments <e> <s> if that is so and if that is all we are talking about then i shall be happy to accept the noble lords assurance and withdraw my amendment <e> <s> if on the other hand the noble and learned lord has any reservations then perhaps he will say so and i shall think again <e>", "<cs> i shall study carefully the noble and learned lords remarks <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to comment on subsection of the new clause <e> <s> i imagine that i address my remarks to the noble earl who moved the amendment <e> <s> are the committee and the noble earl satisfied that in practical terms it is possible to avoid cross-subsidisation among different classes of investment business in the same firm <e>", "<cs> may i say that it is not because i have taken a trappist vow that i remain silent but becaue the noble lords noble friend in my view has put an extremely cogent case and on our side we would support it <e>", "<cs> we are not on the sib mailing list <e> <s> if we were or if we had civil servants to back us up perhaps we would be better informed <e>", "<cs> can the noble and learned lord say whether those amendments will be available in committee or whether they will come to us at the report stage <e>", "<cs> we shall have to look at this because it raises some important issues but i do not want at this stage to discuss them <e> <s> we shall not oppose the amendments <e> <s> we shall look at it and come back on report if we feel it necessary <e>", "<cs> i shall wait to comment on this amendment until we come to the question whether clause shall stand part <e>", "<cs> we have come to a part of the bill which is of particular interest to the committee because whereas in previous parts of the bill we may have been dealing with professional business we are now dealing with investment schemes which are widely available to the general public <e> <s> it is therefore important indeed more than ever important that the provisions of the bill should be right and properly understood <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the interventions of the noble baroness lady seear and the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is quite right <e> <s> this is an important bill and it is important to the city of london <e> <s> however may i say to the noble and learned lord and i am sure he would agree with me that it is vitally important that this bill should be right <e> <s> it is not a question of getting through any bill it is a question of getting through a bill that is right <e>", "<cs> i did not ask why time sharing is excluded <e> <s> i understand perfectly why time sharing is excluded <e> <s> i was not asking that question although i might ask a supplementary question <e> <s> if there are two properties in a time-sharing scheme that would appear to come into a direct investment scheme while if there were only one that would appear to be excluded <e>", "<cs> before replying to the noble lord may i ask him about something he said <e> <s> i understood him to say that the relationship between the share price for an open-ended investment company and the value of the property to which those shares relate would be fixed by order <e> <s> is my understanding right or did i mishear the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that piece of information and also for the information the noble lord gave to the noble lord lord tryon that investment trusts are not included in open-ended investment companies because i cannot for the life of me see what open-ended companies are if they are not investment trusts <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his response <e> <s> i now understand that we are dealing with organisations that can intervene with their own funds on the stock market to keep their shares up or down as the case may be <e> <s> it is if i may say so a somewhat surprising concept beyond the stabilisation period which is normal in terms of new issues <e> <s> nevertheless if that is what the noble lord says then so be it <e> <s> i understand that we shall get a consultation document on the latter part of subsection and that the consultation document will no doubt answer all my questions <e> <s> i am a little concerned that we are writing into statute things that we will not know until the consultative document appears <e> <s> but i understand that if you are going to have a statute you might as well write in the ucits directive and see <e>", "<cs> i have a simple question about clause <e> <s> will the regulations that the secretary of state or the designated agency makes stipulate the ownership of management companies of authorised unit trust schemes and the level which other operators in the investment business may hold <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his indication that a consultative document on yet another clause will be published <e> <s> i hate to come back on this question looking as i do at the noble earl lord limerick who is a very distinguished figure in an institution which has a large holding in a management company of a unit trust scheme but i do not wish to single out the noble earl there are other people involved <e> <s> indeed there are other banks which have ownership in management companies of unit trusts <e>", "<cs> i have a very simple question <e> <s> clause refers to the trustees giving notice to the secretary of state of any proposal to replace the manager of the scheme <e> <s> would the trustees also be obliged to notify the secretary of state if the existing manager of the scheme the company managing the unit trust in question were bought by somebody else in other words if there was a change of ownership or control <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his assurance <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord although his was in a sense a half answer <e> <s> the half of his answer that was right was that i am dealing with questions of conflicts of interest between people who own management companies of unit trust schemes and the unit trusts themselves <e> <s> it must be fundamental and as i understand it this is in this legislation that unit trusts shall be independent self-standing bodies that will not be subject to pressures from people who might own the management company <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> we shall wait to see what the conduct of business rules actually state <e> <s> if they are unsatisfactory then we shall have to return to this point in some manner or form <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his explanation <e> <s> i did not know what he has just told the committee and i understand that however unsatisfactory it may be it probably has to be contained in our statute <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his very full response <e> <s> i think the proper thing for me to do is to read in the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that he was speaking also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i accept that these are extremely complicated questions <e> <s> this is a whole new clause <e> <s> i should prefer to read the provisions quietly and come back to the matter with any amendments that we may have when we come to the report stage in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i have to make the same response as i made before on new clauses <e> <s> we shall have to study them and if we have any problems we shall have to move amendments on report <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for introducing these new clauses which are almost tantamount to a new bill <e> <s> we shall have to look at them carefully <e> <s> again it is impossible for me to respond at this stage as i am sure he recognises <e> <s> if necessary we shall move amendments on report <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene but the noble lord has mentioned my name and what i said <e> <s> i specifically said that at the time the takeover panel was set up in it derived its authority from the bank of england and at that time the bank of england had very great authority in the markets <e> <s> the bank of england has no longer such authority in the markets which is why i am saying that a commission is required an sib which has that same authority over a wide range as that which in my view the bank of england no longer has <e>", "<cs> perhaps we may reserve this discussion of the authority of the takeover panel and its consequences until we come to that amendment <e>", "<cs> like the bank of england <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene so early in the noble lords intervention but i did not say that the bank of england lacked any authority <e> <s> i said that the bank of england which had the authority to set up the takeover panel as a direct dependency of the bank in did not in my view have the authority to supervise the sib or to set up direct dependencies today <e> <s> that is why i would resist the idea that the sib should be a dependency of the bank of england <e> <s> i believe that the sib should be a dependency of the crown <e> <s> that was the argument i was making <e> <s> whereas in the bank was very powerful in that area we are now on a wider canvas and i think the sib should be based on the crown <e>", "<cs> i would certainly accept what the noble lord lord boardman has said <e> <s> if i said or implied in any way that the bank of englands authority over the banks under its supervision or the bank of englands general status had been undermined i certainly withdraw the remark i made <e> <s> what i was trying to imply was that the takeover panel was created as the noble lord lord obrien will tell us if he intervenes under certain circumstances in when the bank of england enjoyed a role in life slightly different from the role it enjoys at the moment <e> <s> perhaps i may refer to the regulation of the london metal exchange over which when i knew it the bank of england had very little authority other than that there was a small commodities division inside the bank which looked after certain matters <e> <s> as professor gower pointed out <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may suggest as a compromise to the committee that the noble lord lord hacking moves his amendment again on report <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord but i am rather less clear than when i started i am afraid <e> <s> the noble lord has mentioned two things which in his view are clearly uncompetitive but which he says are in the nature of investor protection and therefore should be accepted by the committee as being uncompetitive but nevertheless should be in mitigation of the general rule that there should be a pursuance of competition <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> maybe my amendment was poorly phrased <e> <s> perhaps i ought to have written to the minister or done it in some other way <e> <s> at present i cannot understand what competition means in the context of clause and clause <e> <s> if the noble lord has any further views on what competition means the definition of the word competition and the context of competition i should <e>", "<cs> i hope it will <e>", "<cs> on the promise of a letter of slightly unspecified dimension and unspecified content i beg leave to withdraw the amendment with the right to bring it back at report stage should i not be satisfied by the letter <e>", "<cs> it is a great pleasure to have further conversations with the noble lord lord brabazon of tara on a subject on which we have had conversations on previous bills <e> <s> it is the question of the staffing of the office of fair trading <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to disagree with the noble lord but the staffing of the office of fair trading is not the responsibility of the director <e> <s> he has made repeated requests to his sponsoring department if i may put it like that to have futher increments without betraying any confidences <e> <s> i do not believe that he is allowed to go out and recruit staff which would be the case if the staffing of his office were his responsibility <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord means what he says in good faith but i must ask him again whether the government are prepared to see that the office is properly staffed both in numbers and in expertise to discharge those functions <e>", "<cs> i have to say what i have said on many previous occasions that we shall have to look at this clause and return to it on report should we feel that there is something objectionable <e> <s> used to know the restrictive trade practices act almost off by heart <e> <s> i am afraid that my knowledge has slightly withered on the vine <e> <s> i shall look at it again and return to the matter on report <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord whether all the matters in chapter xi of the bill will be subject to the current review of competition policy at present being conducted by dr leisner <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i shall repeat my question in the hope that guidance will arrive by carrier pigeon <e> <s> will the matters referred to in chapter xi of the bill be the subject of the current review of competition policy conducted by dr leisner <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord marshall of leeds for his clear explanation of where the insurance companies stand this leads me to press my amendment <e> <s> those of us who have long-term life insurance contracts are also perhaps investors in unit trusts <e> <s> we may have occupational pensions and all sorts of other things where we have long-term assets <e> <s> i simply do not grasp the argument that the noble lord lord marshall has put forward that in some way insurance companies managing investments on behalf of beneficiaries as do other institutions and all people who manage funds should be subject to different rules <e> <s> if under another act the rules are similar to those which will be imposed on collective investment schemes or investment business under the bill i am perfectly happy <e> <s> i should however like that assurance

half of it and by the end i believed two-thirds <e> <s> perhaps if i read it carefully i may believe the whole lot <e> <s> i shall have to see but we may come back on report <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his long explanation of friendly societies their history their social objectives and their responsibilities for

have said and make my own comments on them <e> <s> i was very grateful for the support of the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> he put his finger as always right on the main problem which is

in my view to a major anomaly <e> <s> the noble lord lord obrien quite rightly referred as he has on previous occasions to the history of the takeover panel <e> <s> i hope that i made it abundantly clear to the committee that i personally and we on this side had no particular complaints about the job that the takeover panel had done over the years <e> <s> we think that it has done a good job and

another form <e> <s> i am not quarreling with the principle <e> <s> we support the principle and i support my honourable friend mr gould in another place <e> <s> however i am a little concerned that it should be in primary legislation rather than in another form <e>", "<cs> i wish to raise essentially the same question that i raised in respect of the question whether clause shall stand part only

for instance that the swiss the americans the italians the australians and others have exactly these provisions but without actually writing them into primary legislation <e> <s> it is very difficult to form a banking operation in switzerland and i speak as one who knows although there is nothing in swiss law which says that reciprocal arrangements shall by statute apply <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord is not trying to make mischief between my noble friend lord bruce of donington and myself <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee is grateful to the noble lord lord lucas for his exposition of the new clause <e> <s> it raises as i am sure he realises and as i think he mentioned a number of extremely complex issues <e> <s> indeed the noble lord has himself identified a certain number of issues where the clause is if i may say so incomplete or at least the explanation is incomplete because there is still the question of which schemes will be excluded and whether pensioner trustees will be in or out of authorisation <e> <s> so we have to wait and see what the government finally intend before discussing this new clause as fully as we should like <e>", "<cs> as the noble

of the bill <e> <s> because i think it would be of use to the noble lord lord hacking i should also like to say that it would help us enormously if we could have a consolidation as it were of notes on clauses and notes on amendments so that in the new reprinted bill we have a clear idea of the governments intention on each clause <e>", "<cs> it was interesting to hear the noble lord lord marshall

settled <e> <s> it is up to noble lords to decide what they will do and whether they wish to speak further on this <e> <s> i shall be consulting with my noble friend about how we handle this particular amendment but i cannot refrain from saying that i find this procedure quite extraordinary <e>", "<cs> to summarise the oppositions position on the ministers proposal it takes us somewhat by surprise that the government have produced a bill laid it before your lordships <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if the noble lord can help me with one or two questions of interpretation <e> <s> this is an exceedingly complex clause in its drafting <e> <s> it is not an easy one for the layman to read <e> <s> if i mention one or two examples of my problems i hope that the noble lord will not think that i am being exhaustive <e> <s> i am sure that many others can cite all kinds of instances where similar problems arise <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies perhaps i may say that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway in a sense took the words out of my mouth <e> <s> the point that i was going to make which was referring to our last debate and is contrary to the point of the noble lord lord henderson of brompton whose advice we normally accept on matters of this type is that it now appears from this debate that the whole of part iii really depends on <e>", "<cs> does sums under those circumstances mean sums of money plus money represented by vouchers of value <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for these numerous clause stand part debates but i am sure that the committee will <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i understand that an authorised person in this clause means an authorised person under the financial services act <e> <s> however as members opposite know there are certain exemptions in the financial services act of people who do not need authorisation <e> <s> when the noble lord says that these people are not consumers i have then to ask him what is a consumer <e> <s> these people may be acting on behalf of a private individual <e> <s> indeed we had a long debate on schedule of the financial services act i remember it well about private individuals going into the foreign exchange market via agents <e> <s> i am slightly confused about the noble lords response and i should be grateful if he could look at this more carefully and perhaps write to me if he comes up with any different conclusions <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord the minister is taking our amendment as seriously as it warrants <e> <s> the clause as presently drafted states <e>", "<cs> i raise again a point which was raised on a number of occasions in your lordships house on second reading and which was raised once or twice in committee <e> <s> clause lays the onus on the secretary of state to lay a report before each house of parliament but in doing so he has obviously to call for reports from the various enforcement authorities and this lays yet another burden on the enforcement authorities <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply and for the intervention of the noble lord lord brougham and vaux <e> <s> i am very surprised that the minister should quote in evidence an act passed by a previous government under a previous administration with a different attitude towards local authority finance <e> <s> if it were the case that the present government were going to adopt the attitude of the previous labour government to local authority finance i should be quite happy that he quotes in evidence the act that we passed <e> <s> but the fact is that the present government have shown a pretty stingy attitude towards local authority expenditure and i am surprised again that the noble lord seeks to pin in some way the responsibility on us for what is after all government policy <e>", "<cs> this is perhaps a small point <e> <s> we note in clause that there are savings for certain privileges and privileges as defined are <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i hope he accepts that i am speaking because of representations that have been made to me by certain accountants that particularly under part iii on misleading price indications auditors may get involved may have confidential communications if you like and may be in a position in which lawyers would normally find themselves as a matter of practice <e>", "<cs> yet again the minister says that consultations are in progress and that in the course of time something will come out of them <e> <s> may we please have an indication from the noble lord because this matter was raised at second reading and he gave if i may say so more or less the same reply then as he has given this evening as to when his consultations will come to a conclusion and when he can bring before the house some indication to his noble friend that his problems have been met <e>", "<cs> on the noble lords point do i understand that the whole of the act will be consolidated in this new bill or only parts of it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that what is needed are not only the learning and teaching of foreign languages but also more substantial backup in terms of personnel and equipment <e> <s> for example word processors should be able to cope with french accents <e> <s> how many word processors in use in this country can produce documents in japanese for example <e> <s> is this not something that the government should look at <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us what progress has been made in completing the internal market on services particuarly financial services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> but can he assure us that this is a government priority because we are told that we are very good at selling services and perhaps not so good in other respects <e> <s> if that is the case will the government make it a priority that we should try to get a free market in services <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house what proportion of those exports are financed under united kingdom government guarantees <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very easy supplementary question <e> <s> is the noble lord aware and does he agree with me that approximately per cent <e> <s> i do not have the exact figure but no doubt the noble lord will give it are under ecgd guarantees <e> <s> does not the noble lord agree that that is very important assistance to british aerospace <e> <s> will the noble lord give on behalf of the government an unequivocal commitment that the assistance to british aerospace will continue in its present form <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the question from the noble baroness lady carnegy will the minister reply to this question does he feel that horticultural training is adequately covered in the schemes that he has in mind <e> <s> is there no further progress that needs to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> is he aware that there is serious disquiet in the british banking community which is shared by the bank of england that major british banks may now be open to takeover from foreign institutions without proper control <e> <s> is he aware that there is nothing in the banking bill so far which prevents this <e> <s> are the government flexible on this issue or is their mind closed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl tell us whether the government intend to impose this arrangement if they fail to reach agreement with the prison officers association <e> <s> if they intend to impose the arrangement are they prepared to face the chaos which may result in our prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords i must press the minister on two questions <e> <s> he accused me of being mischievous about the privatisation plans which may lie behind the rover corporate plan <e> <s> is not he himself being less than frank <e> <s> is he now saying that the corporate plan has been devised not for the purposes of privatisation but for the purposes of ensuring that this company will remain in the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships house will be most grateful to the noble lord lord sherfield for his clear exposition of the contents of the report <e> <s> i should like to join the noble baroness lady hooper in thanking him for his contribution as well as thanking other noble lords who served on his committee <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be grateful to the noble viscount for raising this question <e> <s> with great respect <e> <s> i take issue with him on <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to disagree with the noble lord lord obrien <e> <s> a majority of people in this country do not have bank accounts <e> <s> indeed although i do not have any figures in mind i suspect that at some time in their lives more people use a solicitor than use a bank <e> <s> at the last count some per cent <e> <s> of the population did not have a bank account <e> <s> the building society movement is of course different because more people have a building society account or share account than have a bank account <e> <s> therefore i am not sure that the noble lords point is entirely correct <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene in the committee stage so late and also on a scottish bill but i gave notice to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate that i might at some stage in the proceedings this afternoon comment on some of the points which seemed to me to be extremely important and which he has very kindly undertaken to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords first i have to declare an interest <e> <s> i am a member of the national committee of the board of a spanish bank <e> <s> i hope that that admission does not disqualify me from talking about this bill <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord young for granting me permission to continue <e>", "<cs> it gives me an opportunity my lords to correct a statement that i made during the debate on polarisation that we had in your lordships house the other day <e> <s> in response to an intervention i was unwise enough to say that the latest information that i possessed was that a minority of the adult population had current accounts in banks <e> <s> the noble lord lord boardman picked up this point and was kind enough to write to me <e> <s> i am therefore very happy to correct the statement that i made and to <e>", "<cs> my lords on these benches we have considerable sympathy with the noble lord lord airedale in his amendment <e> <s> in committee it was my understanding that he received a fairly favourable reception from the government in principle <e> <s> i thought that they were going to go away and think about the matter <e> <s> he has made a fair and valid point <e> <s> if my understanding of the tone of the governments response in committee was mistaken i hope the tone of the governments response may be more sympathetic this time around <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to support this amendment from the opposition benches i have no wish to repeat what the noble lord lord allen has said in introducing his amendment <e> <s> nor indeed have i any wish to repeat the arguments that we went through in committee on the general question of the development risks defence because i think that the noble lord lord allen has wisely taken a rather more narrow point which is specifically the one relating to drugs or pharmaceuticals <e>", "<cs> my lords i said at the outset that i did not regard my amendment as being <e>", "<cs> my lords we would regard this as a wrecking amendment of part ii <e> <s> if this amendment is accepted by the government we would regard it as changing the whole basis of part ii for the very reasons which the noble lord lord mottistone has introduced <e> <s> therefore if the government feel at all tempted we wish to divide the house against it <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will not accept this amendment and will stick firmly to the course which is plainly chartered in the bill as drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for his explanation of the amendment which has been tabled in response to interventions made in committee by the noble lord lord hacking and myself <e> <s> i was fearful that i should have to respond on behalf of the noble lord lord hacking but i notice that as if by magic he appeared in the chamber while the noble lord the minister was speaking and is now in his place <e> <s> i think the noble lord heard approximately one-half to five-eighths of what the minister said so i will try very hard to summarise for his benefit the three-eighths which are important and which he perhaps did not hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i should certainly like to congratulate all noble lords who have taken part in this most interesting debate on the motion if i may pay the compliment to my noble friend so eloquently moved by lord cledwyn of penrhos <e> <s> i believe these congratulations are in order not only because your lordships have demonstrated very considerable wisdom but i think you have demonstrated without any doubt at all if ever there was any doubt that in the words of my noble friends motion manufacturing is important and indeed centrally important to the economic prosperity of britain <e> <s> there was universal or almost universal agreement to that the only discordant voice perhaps being that of the noble lord lord bauer to whom i shall return later <e> <s> i say if ever there was any doubt because at one time i believe there was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lords the lord advocate and lord denning <e> <s> they illustrate precisely my difficulties <e> <s> i understand that the noble and learned lord lord denning finds this language extremely easy but he has had long experience in the courts <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate finds it equally easy because he has long experience as a lawyer <e> <s> however speaking as a non-lawyer i find the language extremely difficult to understand and because the bill must be understood by non-lawyers as well as by lawyers i hoped that the government might be able to find some better wording <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord lord mottistone in fact have no such expectation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for the indication which i have no doubt was not misleading the noble lord lord mottistone proved my point absolutely <e> <s> he had no expectation <e> <s> he expressed the fact that he had no expectation <e> <s> that is how we knew that he had an expectation or did not have an expectation <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand the noble lord to say that an estimate is not a price indication whereas a quotation is a price indication in the context of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his patience in explaining what i think is an extremely difficult area <e> <s> i believe that it is fairly easy to determine what is the price of a physical good <e> <s> if it is seen in a shop window with a price of p on it then p is the price indication or we assume that it is <e> <s> it is rather more difficult in the case of a service <e> <s> as clause deals mostly with services i was anxious to have this debate to elicit exactly what in the governments view was meant by misleading price indications in a variety of services <e> <s> the fact that we have even had this problem between estimate and quotation justifies my pursuing into report stage the debate that was stated in committee on clause stand part <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not accept that the noble lord lord campbell is entitled to a rather fuller reply to his question which raises an important point <e> <s> if fimbra fails to meet the requirements of the sib and therefore cannot become an sro is it not the case that the sib have to do the job themselves in other words that there is a special sro set up for the purpose by the sib <e> <s> or will the sib try to push building societies and others into another sro <e> <s> what is the governments attitude to all this <e> <s> there is a problem here to which the government need to pay attention <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining exactly what the amendment means <e> <s> i had taken the amendment to be similar to our amendment no <e> <s> however from what the noble lord has said it applies only to those people who are seconded to the bank and who are therefore part of the bank staff at the particular moment when the bank is performing its functions under the act <e> <s> as such it is a welcome clarification <e> <s> i was intending to include in the discussion our amendment no <e> <s> however in the light of what the noble lord has said we shall move amendment no separately <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his response <e> <s> in my introduction i think i recognised that i was raising problems that had been discussed in the context of the building societies act and the financial services act <e> <s> i realise that if a precedent were to be set here it would have to be followed by amendments to those acts <e> <s> nevertheless i find it hard to accept the arguments of the noble lord just as hard to accept them today as when we were discussing the building societies bill and the financial services bill <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as i mentioned when i was moving both these amendments they were in the nature of probing amendments to see what the scope and intention of clause was <e> <s> there is no intention at all from these benches to try to diminish in any way the role of the bank in this respect <e> <s> clearly the supervisory authority must have immunity from damages when it is acting in a proper legal and sensible manner in accordance with the legislation which we are now discussing <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i look forward to receiving his letter and when we have it we shall decide what if anything we need to do at another stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he responded to my half invitation to say that my amendment was too extreme <e> <s> i believe that was the thrust of what he had to say <e> <s> i admitted that the amendment was perhaps designed to elicit some further response than simply that it would not work <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord and i recognise the difficulty which he is in <e> <s> he cannot set policy for the next six months <e> <s> therefore we shall have to wait and see what appointments are made to the board <e> <s> nevertheless i should draw his attention again to the problem that i have outlined <e> <s> i should also draw his attention to the fact that so far as i am aware these arrangements are not only different to the securities and investments board but also to the building societies commission which does not have building societies executives forming the whole of the independent sector of the building societies commission <e> <s> as much as the government have tried to introduce this as the third part of a financial regulatory system if i may put it that way we have a system in the bill the crucial system of the bill which is the board of banking supervision <e> <s> that is different in nature to the others <e> <s> that is the point upon which we have to reflect <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply to the noble lord lord tordoff on behalf of my noble friend lord bruce of donington and also make one or two comments concerning the intervention of the noble lord lord obrien <e>", "<cs> when tabling amendments members do not necessarily stick to every conceivable word in committee <e> <s> we are allowed to change our minds in the light of discussion <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls not recognise that the rigidity he is talking about is there whether one uses the word regular or monthly <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the secretary of state <e> <s> i think this has been a very useful exchange because we have established that there is a certain rigidity though its type may change <e> <s> i hope <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> we now see that the bank shall make regular or irregular reports as the case may be <e> <s> it is very important to get these understandings absolutely clear in our minds <e> <s> they are important and we need to have the board and particularly the independent members properly informed about what is going on <e> <s> i take the noble lords point absolutely about the independent members having the power under the clause as drafted to ask for supplementary information <e> <s> they can clearly use that should they consider the information they are getting which the bank considered relevant not to be relevant <e> <s> they can ask for more information <e> <s> as long as the request for further information is reasonable as i am sure it would be there is the necessary power under that clause <e> <s> so i take the noble lords point on that and i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> i am still very interested in looking at what the noble lord said about the regular reports and regularity <e> <s> i shall read his remarks carefully in <e>", "<cs> as it happens i was not going to move amendment no <e> <s> if that satisfies the noble lord lord tordoff i now beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> do i understand that it is the governments intention to maintain always a majority of independent members on the board <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the secretary of state and to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> this is exactly the assurance i was looking for that there will be at all times a majority of independent members on the board of supervision <e> <s> having received that assurance from the government i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must beg the pardon of the secretary of state <e> <s> i tried to point out that there was an <e>", "<cs> i should be perfectly happy with whatever amendment the noble lord lord tordoff feels is more acceptable <e> <s> i said that i did not see that there had to be a report on procedure in every annual report <e> <s> i envisage that it would start with procedure in the first annual report saying this is how we operate <e> <s> then subsequent annual reports would give any deviation from that procedure <e> <s> but the report would be the vehicle <e>", "<cs> yes i am very happy to write to the noble lord explaining what i mean and what i think the noble lord lord tordoff interprets us to be saying <e> <s> perhaps we may come back to it <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord the secretary of state tell me whether the treasury is consulted on facilities remuneration and allowances for members of the building societies commission <e>", "<cs> i ask this question because i am making a point <e> <s> all along on all sides of the committee we have accepted the governments view that this is the third leg of legislation to do with the financial markets <e> <s> therefore the more that the third leg if i may use the expression about this rather extraordinary animal is similar to the other various legs the better off we are <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i see that we cannot get very much further with this today and i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> am i to understand that my amendment is unnecessary in all respects and that the expression classes of transaction is superfluous because there are already arrangements under this clause which make it so <e>", "<cs> i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i understand the argument that he puts forward against this amendment and i am inclined to accept it <e> <s> it was something that i had overlooked <e> <s> however is he saying that a deferred share in a building society that is incorporated and has yet to be authorised is in fact a deposit for the purposes of this bill <e>", "<cs> in that case i understand and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> what about scottish banks <e> <s> are they also exempted <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i fully accept as i said in my introduction that at the moment i cannot see anything other than rather esoteric transactions involving deposits made and repaid at a discount but i can see the possibility of that happening <e> <s> i accept what the noble lord says that the treasury has the power to make an order to cope with any such eventuality <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> if the act is to be repealed will sterling <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> i was going to press the noble lord on money market operations which do not involve the issue of paper but i shall not worry him with it <e> <s> perhaps he will be kind enough to look at the matter and write to me <e> <s> in the meantime <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he has certainly covered a totally different point from the one i made <e> <s> i agree that if my amendment were accepted it would widen the ambit in the way that he has suggested <e> <s> he may think that that is undesirable <e> <s> i was not directing my attention to that <e> <s> i was concerned that there are businesses which by any commonsense definition would be deposit-taking businesses yet which finance their loan book in such a manner that they would be excluded because they were financing themselves by more than half three-quarters or per cent <e> <s> whatever it might be from transactions which were not under this bill deposits because they were wholesale money market transactions that is inter-bank deposits <e> <s> that was the point i was making <e>", "<cs> that is an interesting and slightly novel point of view

who take some form of retail deposit require such authorisation <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly have to think about that and read very carefully what the noble lord has said in <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly consider what the noble lord has said <e> <s> perhaps he will be kind enough to think about the problem and drop me a line clearly confirming the position of the government <e> <s> at the moment i am in some doubt about the exact position <e> <s> if he can do that i shall be most grateful <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord and to the noble lord lord elton <e> <s> it is a very important point <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i hoped that i had explained the purpose of my amendment <e> <s> i accept that the wording may be defective <e> <s> the treasury should have some duty when redefining or defining deposit taking businesses to consult the securities and investments board or whatever designated agency there may be or indeed <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> probably we do not need those words if the accountant is as specified because it is already approved under the companies act <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his undertaking to look at this matter again <e> <s> i can do no more than reiterate the points that have been made both by myself in introducing this amendment and talking to amendment no and also by my noble friend lord bruce of donington <e> <s> if we are to have something on the face of the bill it seems to me that it should be specific and quite clear in what it intends <e> <s> if the noble lord is prepared to look at it again in that light i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i did not wish to prevent the noble earl from making his observations but i thought it would be useful and time-saving for the committee if i put forward our view in speaking to amendment no <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his response <e> <s> if he assures me as he appears to be doing that amendment no is not necessary i am perfectly happy with that explanation <e> <s> it needs a slightly complicated mind to work its way through the provisions of the bill to decide that it is not necessary but if the noble lord tells me that i am prepared to accept it <e>", "<cs> that technical discussion was very interesting <e> <s> it brings into play the whole question of permanent floating rate notes which are regarded as the capital of banks by the bank of england and raises all sorts of technical questions which i do not want to go into at this stage <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for his response which was worth putting on the record <e> <s> this matter was discussed quite extensively in another place as he said and i do not intend to pursue this amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i hear all that he says <e> <s> i understand every word that he says but it does not seem to answer the point which is that the bank has powers under the bill as drafted to revoke an authorisation under circumstances where it is as he says uncertain as to whether the criteria may or may not have been fulfilled <e> <s> although that may be open to appeal to a tribunal to have the threat of revocation even on an appealable basis hanging over an institution seems to be a powerful weapon <e> <s> i am not sure that the words in the bill as drafted although they repeat previous legislation are entirely satisfactory nevertheless i shall read carefully what the noble lord says <e> <s> if there is anything that he wishes to say to me before i decide what to do with the amendment perhaps he would like to intervene <e>", "<cs> i accept that the bank should intervene where there is a problem related to the protection of depositors <e> <s> that was not clear in the act <e> <s> i accept the noble lords explanation <e> <s> revocation of authorisation is a big gun <e> <s> unless the bank is satisfied that it has the appropriate backing for that rather dramatic step it should not take it <e> <s> i am sure that the bank will operate in a wise manner but if we are to write legislation it should be properly expressed <e> <s> that is the point that i was making <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his assurance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord and the noble earl lord limerick and the noble lord lord obrien <e> <s> i agree with the noble earl when he said as i said on second reading that with the spread of modern technology it is rumours rather than actual action that cause modern runs on a bank <e> <s> on second reading i said that the continental illinois went bust in twenty seconds simply because there was a rumour that the chicago board of trade had withdrawn a deposit of million dollars <e> <s> that rumour set off a whole series of market operations which nearly broke a very major bank <e>", "<cs> before we agree clause i should like to seek an assurance from the government that clauses and in fact apply even though an authorised institution may surrender its authorisation under clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for stating what is perilously near the obvious <e> <s> i do not want to anticipate the discussions that will take place at a later stage as regards where government policy might impact on principles of lending <e> <s> therefore at this moment i shall not seek to pursue the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw the attention of the committee to clause e <e> <s> under this clause the bank may give an institution directions and those directions are spelt out <e> <s> clause e states that the bank for the purposes of safeguarding its assets and so forth <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for

of improvements to the bill during its passage through the house <e> <s> they have perhaps not been in full the improvements that we should have liked to have seen but there has been some progress and on some issues the government have shown a welcome flexibility for which we are grateful <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for entering into the debate at a rather late stage <e> <s> the debate has been interesting and indeed somewhat complex <e> <s> i rise merely to support one of the points made by my noble friend lord stallard in moving his amendment that is the question of the cost of

simply like to leave it there <e> <s> i accept that there may be problems between myself and the noble lord lord elton about its meaning but nevertheless the problem still remains <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will not think me rude but i am sure he would agree with me that mr tony benn has always been a defender of the national interest <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne has raised a very important point and we must recognise that and be grateful to him <e> <s> there is a distinction between financial services in the broad run and banking itself <e> <s> it may be a fine point but i believe that there is a distinction <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point <e> <s> he will remember that when paribas was floated again on the french stock market it had a golden share as did tsb <e> <s> tsb has certain provisions to make sure that it cannot be taken over by other people for a certain period of time <e> <s> i used the phrase golden share to explain that <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrupting the noble lord <e> <s> is he telling us that the criteria which were used in the case of the hong kong and shanghai bank attempted acquisition of the royal bank of scotland will remain in the fair trading act and will be used in the future in analogous acquisitions <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i did not understand that it was grouped with no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> there is only one point on which i wish to press the secretary of state the terms of his request to his right honourable friend the secretary of state in his competition review to look at <e>", "<cs> perhaps it is time for the opposition front bench to have a word in this argument <e> <s> it has been difficult to get a word in edgeways <e> <s> however i have been interested to hear what noble and distinguished lords have had to say about the problem <e> <s> it is probably the first occasion in this chamber when i have found myself in almost total agreement with the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> it is gratifying that that should be so <e>", "<cs> that was my last point and since there have been so many contributions i shall let the matter rest there <e>", "<cs> before we leave this clause i should like to express some concern since this is a new clause in the banking bill which was not in the act <e> <s> i refer to the phrase in subsection <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord but he addressed the question of why the treatment of unsolicited calls in this bill is different to the treatment in the financial services act which i fully understand and the reasons for it <e> <s> that is not my question <e> <s> in the light of the problems under the financial services act i asked what is the governments definition of the expression <e>", "<cs> before we leave clause there are two questions that i should like to put to the noble lord <e> <s> am i right in thinking that because of the wider definition of deposit in subsection of this clause clause covers fraudulent inducement to make a loan as well as a deposit <e> <s> clause defines deposit and in that clause subsection excludes deposits made by authorised institutions the bank etc <e>", "<cs> this amendment obviously makes sense <e> <s> i am glad that the government are not trying to extend united kingdom jurisdiction into foreign jurisdictions <e> <s> nevertheless i wonder whether it covers fully the point that the noble lord is getting at <e> <s> i understand that if the amendment is accepted the authorised institution has to be incorporated in the united kingdom <e> <s> if it is incorporated in the united kingdom but is the subsidiary of a foreign institution an american spanish or french bank or whatever it may be and if a significant shareholder of say per cent <e> <s> is introduced does that transaction fall under the clause as amended if the government amendment is accepted <e> <s> in that case it may well encounter the same problem as we had before in that the us institution which is taking per cent <e> <s> of the bank incorporated in the united kingdom may not he aware of the requirements <e>", "<cs> before we leave this clause may i quickly ask the noble lord to confirm that my understanding is correct <e> <s> in clause b the bill as drafted refers to <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord strathclyde for moving his amendments and explaining them <e> <s> when he put down this amendment i was uncertain whether related company included an associated company but he says that it does <e> <s> i am now uncertain as to whether it moves upwards as well as downwards <e> <s> i can understand that outside a group in terms of the companies act it is sensible to have powers of investigation into a company that is not controlled in the full companies act sense of the term <e> <s> i am wondering whether he means by related company a company that is a shareholder which has a relation with the authorised hank into which it is to conduct the investigation <e> <s> no doubt the minister will be able to satisfy us all that this is either covered by the bill or else that it requires the amendment in question <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to the minister and say that i think he is right <e> <s> on the whole i believe that these amendments are right <e> <s> nevertheless it would be wrong to allow the amendments to be accepted as they are by the government without noticing as the noble lord has <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord and indeed the government what will happen if there is an underwriting stick and there is a rights issue by a company which is underwritten by an authorised institution which does not sell in the market as a result of which the authorised institution finds itself in the position of controlling per cent <e> <s> of a company <e> <s> this can happen <e> <s> in the past it has happened <e> <s> if the authorised institution is <e> <s> for one reason or another under investigation is it proper and right that the related company which through no fault of its own has gone to that authorised institution for the underwriting and finds itself temporarily

lord lord elton should think that the secretary of state needs any support on this issue <e> <s> it seems to me that the secretary of state is perfectly able to respond to the intervention of the noble lord without any support whatsoever <e>", "<cs> i cannot quite understand why the amendment is necessary but no doubt the noble lord will explain <e> <s> is not information also in documentary form <e> <s> it can be information in whatever form is appropriate <e> <s> if the insertion is or documents why not or in recorded telephone conversations or in tapes or whatever <e> <s> i believe that the expression information is as broad as one can get without having to qualify it by putting in the expression or documents <e> <s> no doubt the draftsman had in mind something which i have missed <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to press the noble lord on this matter but i cannot understand why it is necessary <e> <s> if it is necessary to specify documents should we not specify other forms of information which are required <e>", "<cs> i raise a small point in relation to clause in the light of amendments moved by the noble lord lord strathclyde which widen the scope of the clause <e> <s> i refer to clause b under which <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> my question relates to the case of an unwitting related company <e> <s> it is a narrow question <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord might also consider a point in clause <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to press the noble lord a little further <e> <s> this is a new clause which was not in the act and therefore it is worth while spending a little time on it <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord elton for pointing out that my original objection should have been slightly wider than it was <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to know how the government see the officer servant or agent of the bank with proper authority going into a completely different bank without a court order and saying we have reasonable cause to believe that there are certain documents which may be in your possession and which you may have removed tampered with or destroyed <e>", "<cs> i am not talking about forced entry or people breaking the door down <e> <s> i am talking about an agent or a servant of a bank going round with a proper authority to another bank <e> <s> if someone from the bank of england arrives at a bank and says i should like this that and the other information nobody will close the door and say you cant have it because that authority comes from the bank of england <e> <s> it is not a question of forced entry or anything like that <e> <s> it is a question of whether these powers are right to require a third party bank to betray what is normally known as banking secrecy without an order from the court <e> <s> while the noble lord lord elton is making a case for the individual i am making the case for a bank <e> <s> that is all <e>", "<cs> this is a very small point <e> <s> it concerns clause and <e> <s> clause enshrines the well known legal privilege <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord regard conversations or potential conversations between a customer and a banker as not being privileged in that sense <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for moving this amendment which we support <e> <s> i can only express some surprise that the negative procedure appeared in the first place because we had this debate on the building societies act in your lordships house where we fought it out twice once in committee and once on report and we achieved in the end the affirmative procedure <e> <s> we had this debate on the financial services act in your lordships house and we fought it out twice to the same end and got the affirmative procedure instead of the negative one <e>", "<cs> we do not think that the opposition are being treated in an underhand way at all <e> <s> i should have thought that almost all those points are matters which should be resolved at official level rather than in this chamber <e> <s> nevertheless the noble lord has a prefect right to raise the points and carry on with them <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord will recognise that there is another regulator the building societies commission <e> <s> if the building societies were represented in this place they might have other points <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord and his officials will wish to look at the single regulator in the light of not only the banking bill but the building societies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth is not here to move his motion <e> <s> nevertheless on behalf of the opposition perhaps i may speak to the regulations and hope that he will be present in the chamber to answer the points that i raise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> my question related particularly to the european community and whether there was any possibility of standardisation within the community <e> <s> i was not asking about the world-wide situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for introducing this draft order <e> <s> it is on the face of it a fairly harmless looking order but it raises a number of problems both of a general and of a particular nature <e> <s> may i put the two general problems first <e> <s> your lordships will be aware that the balance of payments statistics have caused if i may put it at its lowest a good deal of trouble in the last few months <e> <s> those of your lordships who attended question time the other day when the noble lord lord diamond raised the point of the revision of the outturn will be aware of what i mean <e>", "<cs> my lords it means that my scepticism was fully justified <e>", "<cs> the companies act <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord says that net value means assets why does he not say net asset value <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord but i do not think that he has answered my question fully if i may say so <e> <s> i wonder whether he has understood all the questions that i have put <e> <s> nevertheless i understand that in his view companies are able to answer these questions however imperfect they may be <e> <s> i understand the governments view that if they wish to write this into legislation even if we do not understand it that is really their business <e> <s> i understand that he wishes to introduce what in trade union terms is called a closed shop so that everybody should be involved in the same procedure and those who have opted out of it may be caught <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount has asked about the attitude of the labour front bench <e> <s> the labour front bench in this house is the front bench for this house <e> <s> what discussions may have taken place among members of another place is confidential to those people and is not a matter that properly concerns your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords in quoting his figures will the minister recognise that the increases in manufacturing productivity since to which he refers have been entirely due to the shedding of labour and that this has created unemployment in the manufacturing sector <e> <s> does he further agree that the increase in productivity in the whole economy as opposed simply to manufacturing which now represents only per cent <e> <s> of total national output is round about the level of the average western european country and significantly below that of japan <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the secretary of state for his full reply <e> <s> i agreed with two-thirds of what he said <e> <s> his introduction to the subsection and his stressing the importance of the independent members all that i agreed with and i think that the opposition would certainly go along with that <e> <s> nevertheless i am bound to say that i started to disagree when he said that the provision for the independent members to express their view was fully catered for <e> <s> that was his expression <e> <s> we do not believe that it is fully catered for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for pursuing the discussion which we had in committee and about which he wrote to me <e> <s> i am still not entirely happy that the definition is fully clear cut and that everybody will understand it <e> <s> however i accept that to try to change the clause at this stage would throw the bill into some confusion <e> <s> i do not intend to press the amendment <e> <s> nevertheless i think it only fair to say that i still have certain concerns about the definition of deposit and the way it carries through into clause and into deposit-taking businesses <e> <s> i am comforted by what the noble lord has said in referring me to clause which gives the treasury power to amend the meaning of deposit <e> <s> i suspect that we shall have to see how the bill when enacted operates and then if necessary the treasury may have to step in and redefine deposit in the appropriate manner <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> however i still have the two problems <e> <s> i accept that under clause the treasury may make an order varying the exemption provisions <e> <s> companies do issue notes securities and commercial paper on a tap basis and they will continue to do so <e> <s> we hope they will because they benefit from that and it is not something which should be stopped <e> <s> therefore just one occasion does not seem to me to cover that important activity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be convenient for the house if i speak also to amendment no <e> <s> in the names of my noble friend lord bruce of donington and myself <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat all the arguments which the noble lord lord elton has set out <e> <s> many of them were set out by both of us at the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> but the noble lord has brought forward some new developments since then which are very interesting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to return to the point but the noble lord did not seem to answer the question i was putting <e> <s> i understand that the definition of unsolicited call in this bill is exactly the same as the definition of unsolicited call in the financial services act <e> <s> i was not making the point that there was any difference <e> <s> i accepted that in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he seemed to me to be relying on the courts to determine materiality under clause lb and since the courts are clearly instructed on material facts under clause a there seems to me to be a dissonance if i can put it that way between the two subsections <e> <s> nevertheless i accept that this is repeating the language of the financial services act and obviously that is not something one would wish to disturb <e> <s> the noble lord might like to bear in mind of course that recklessly is a word which gave us a great deal of trouble in connection with that act and recklessly in scottish courts so i am advised by my noble friend lord morton of shuna has a meaning rather different from its meaning in the courts of england and wales <e> <s> that was a debate we had in connection with the financial services act but i see that it has not had much impact on the government <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords leaving aside cause and effect will the noble lord give the house the governments estimate for for both manufacturing trade deficit and the expected loss of employment in manufacturing <e>", "<cs> my lords since this bill has given rise to a certain amount of controversy i do not think that it would be right to let it leave your lordships house without making one or two comments <e> <s> i do not intend to detain your lordships for very long <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not accept that the government which after all still have nearly half of the equity of british telecom are in a perfect position to instruct british telecom to spend a minuscule part of the monopoly profits that it makes on the humanitarian service which the noble lord asks about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lords lord bruce-gardyne and lord obrien and indeed to the minister for speaking to the amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may take up the point made by the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> clearly if the chancellor instructs the bank to do something which is against the advice of the board of banking supervision it might be considered rather otiose for the independent members to go to him and present their advice which had been disregarded <e> <s> nevertheless as the noble lord and i well know there are various ways and means of placing that advice before the chancellor and of letting it be known that that advice was disregarded <e> <s> therefore there is a lever which should not be underestimated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for confirming my understanding <e> <s> i am glad to have that matter on the record <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome this redefinition if i may so express it of the powers under section of the financial services act <e> <s> i am still unclear as to what reciprocity really

i would say this to the noble lord the secretary of state if he were here defended their position extremely well on the control of major financial institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not believe that anything the secretary of state said was different from what mr tebbit said in <e> <s> indeed the secretary of state went out of his way to say that it was exactly what

departments of all the major firms on the stock exchange have been overwhelmed by the vast number of small bargains which have resulted particularly from the tsb and british gas issues <e> <s> what steps can the government take to ensure that small shareholders can deal properly and without excessive cost or delay <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the governments refusal to support the european programme together with their unenthusiastic response to the report of your lordships select committee on science and technology and the answer given by the noble baroness to a question on a similar topic are all rapidly giving the impression that the government are anti-science <e> <s> it is that impression above all that is causing the scientific brain-drain from this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the japanese are not impressed by ministerial statements or by british ministers who visit tokyo uttering dire threats like a latter-day king lear <e> <s> they are not impressed unless action is taken <e> <s> either the government are going to take action or they should keep quiet <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in understanding the noble lord when he refers to a qualifying merger under the fair trading act to be referring to the assets threshold below which mergers cannot be considered for reference by the secretary of state <e> <s> if that is the case is there an assurance that the price that is to be paid in other words the assets that have been acquired including the goodwill will come above the threshold and that that is why the office of fair trading is considering it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord satisfied that the law as it stands i refer to the financial services act gives proper protection to those people in receipt of direct mail for schemes dubious or otherwise so that they are not unnecessarily taken in <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what the noble lord lord campbell of croy has said what action

before the noble lord finishes this point i wonder whether he will kindly clarify one matter about which i am still doubtful <e> <s> as i understand it the regulations made by sib if the delegation order goes ahead derive from the powers conferred on the secretary of state and are therefore part of the statute law of the land <e> <s> am i right or am i wrong on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his explanation of the orders <e> <s> i would make only three small points which were made by the friendly societies to the director general of fair trading when he was studying these orders <e> <s> first there is a problem with the cost of meeting some of the sib requirements which may be disproportionately heavy for small societies <e> <s> secondly there are societies with membership limited to particular trades and professions whose voluntary representatives may face particular problems in meeting the standards of advice required <e> <s> thirdly there are commercial societies with a limited product range the sale of whose products would be limited by the reduction in the number of independent intermediaries <e> <s> i put those points on the record

document <e> <s> we do not propose to reintroduce the old form of exchange controls because we think that we have a repatriation policy on portfolio investment which is rather better <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for explaining the reasons for the commons amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am bound to say that we are somewhat disappointed that the government did not accept the amendment that was passed on division in your lordships house on report <e> <s> i am the more disappointed because in another place when this bill was discussed the minister in his second reading speech said that he wished to hear the views of both sides of the house before reaching a final decision <e> <s> that was on th april <e> <s> as i understand those words they meant that he had something of an open mind <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for explaining the reasons that the government introduced this amendment in another place and why we are now being asked

association recently did a study on the sale of wine in public houses and came to the conclusion that not only did quantity and quality vary but also that price apparently had no relation to either of those matters <e> <s> what is the governments view of that study <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that a central component of a successful manufacturing investment is a stepped-up effort

have been addressed to him <e> <s> we accept that there are certain procedures which have to be gone through before the secretary of state can make up his mind whether to refer this merger to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> nevertheless even at this stage i should like to ask the noble lord a series of questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to clarify one point with the secretary of state <e> <s> he said that it was a requirement of the takeover panel that the merger should lapse if there were a referral <e> <s> i believe i am right in saying that it is a requirement of the takeover panel that the particular terms of the offer should lapse but not the intention to merge <e> <s> that is the point i was getting at <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of comments made on all sides of the house will not the secretary of state recognise that the timetable is set by him and the director general can report to him in the fullness of time or tomorrow as the case may be <e> <s> it would be no problem for the secretary of state to announce now he can correct me if i am wrong under the fair trading act that whatever the recommendation of the director general of fair trading may be he the secretary of state intends to refer this to the monopolies and mergers <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord beaverbrook for introducing the second reading of this bill which we on this side of the house support <e> <s> i shall not detain your lordships for very long but there are one or two points that i feel i ought to make because this bill

understand the reply but i find it a bit odd if i may say so <e> <s> serials such as many which we have seen on television seem to be part of one entity <e> <s> to have a split period of copyright

totality and should possibly be seen as discrete <e> <s> i use that word purely in the sense of boundaries in that there are clear limits <e> <s> there is a beginning and an end to such serials and

competition policy starts to intervene <e> <s> competition policy in this country is dominated by the fair trading act and competition policy comes under articles and of the treaty of rome <e> <s>

one of substance <e> <s> as such i do not wish to challenge it <e> <s> i wish to reiterate my view that a greater definition of general licence is required before the bill can be allowed to become a

in committee and i think we covered the ground very fully <e> <s> for my part although i started off with a view which the noble lord lord rodney takes i was more or less persuaded by the government

explanation will arrive very <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the government on arriving at what i think is about the only possible compromise in a very difficult situation <e> <s> a lot of noble

debate that we had in committee <e> <s> i believe that on balance the government have reached a reasonable conclusion <e> <s> it is always necessary to strike a balance and we shall object to the

amendment no <e> <s> in my name and that of my noble friend lord morton of shuna <e>", "<cs> my lords our objection to the formulation in the bill in clause was not that industry should not pay properly for copyright material that it uses in its research <e> <s> it was on the grounds of difficulty of enforceability that we could not tell what was commercial research and what was not commercial research and whether people in academic institutions were working half for one company and half for themselves that is half commercial and half non-commercial <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the government for giving consideration to the doubts about clause which we expressed in committee <e> <s> the new draft which is presented by the noble lord in amendments nos <e> <s> and

understand why he resists amendment no <e> <s> on the grounds that there is a copyright tribunal to which these matters can properly be referred <e> <s> i suppose that if every educational establishment is overcharged by some library or other and the matter goes to the copyright tribunal with all the problems of red tape and so on one could resolve it but it seems to be rather doubtful

stage <e>", "<cs> my lords as will have been clear from our attitude on the crown copyright we would certainly support the noble lord lord mottistone in any diminution of crown copyright <e> <s> it seems to us that any related purpose is a phrase without any restriction whatsoever and the crown should be restricted in what it can do in relation to copyright <e> <s> we would very strongly support the noble lord in pressing this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord also speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> b c and d <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> gives rise to considerable complexity as i think the noble lord adumbrated in his introduction <e> <s> if it is possible for auctioneers or anyone else to copy artistic works in a catalogue to sell that catalogue and to produce

auctioneer merely to produce a catalogue is it an infringement for the person who buys such a catalogue or receives it gratis to pass it on to a friend or to sell it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble minister decides what to do with the amendment would it not be better in all honesty that he should withdraw it and come back on third reading with a better formulation <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the government for recognising that the original formulation of this clause made no sense whatever i think that we pointed that out in committee <e> <s> the new formulation seems to us to be an enormous improvement <e> <s> we now understand that where an artist has sold the copyright he has sold the copyright <e> <s> therefore the copyright is no longer his and if he infringes that he is infringing copyright <e> <s> so we are content with this amendment and again are glad that the government have recognised that the opposition have made some cogent arguments in committee

the house <e> <s> i understand that it is not proper for a noble lord to say why he is not moving an amendment <e> <s> an amendment must be moved a reply must be given and then it can be withdrawn

that the noble lord <e> <s> lord jenkin will be able to explain away my difficulty <e> <s> i can understand what he and the amendment are getting at <e> <s> nevertheless i suspect that the thrust of what he is trying to do may be covered by clause a in the bill as drafted that is to say <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for setting out in great detail how the government have arrived at the new series of amendments which the noble lord has tabled <e> <s> in general we on this side of the house are sympathetic to the aims of the noble lord and the government and to the amendments <e> <s> i do not wish to raise matters of principle on these amendments in view of the sensitivity of the subject but there are one or two rather small points about which i should like to ask the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his replies to the questions that i asked <e> <s> before he sits down i should like to suggest that he may wish to give a certain amount of attention to the last question <e> <s> it is difficult to present a notice at the point of contact as it were rather than after one can leave any sort of notice on the pavement <e> <s> however when one is making the seizure it is difficult to present a notice other than one which is drafted in clearly defined terms specifying the powers under which the notice is issued <e> <s> it seems to me to be important for a street trader if those are the people with whom we are dealing to be assured that the notice is in the prescribed form and the prescribed form should be one which is clearly understood by him <e> <s> that is my point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i believe that he has taken the right course of action for the government <e> <s> i can only applaud his good sense in accepting the amendment and his graciousness in admitting that sometimes on this side of the house we have some important points to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased that the government have cut the gordian knot because it was becoming complicated on presumptions of subsistence of copyright <e> <s> the only minor complaint i have is that the noble lord has consistently referred to the law of england as opposed to the law of england and wales <e> <s> however he makes a distinction between england and wales and scotland <e>",

ground <e> <s> i am concerned about the definition of a manager who is not a director a secretary or an official as defined under the companies act <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that by inserting the word manager to which i am sure we will all agree he has opened up something of a pandoras box in the definition which may have implications for future companies legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments housekeeping has been extremely effective if i may say so and has produced a very large group of amendments which quite rightly seek to clear up and clarify the drafting of this particular chapter <e> <s> we are perfectly happy with their conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords would the performance of the royal lancers jazz band or whatever the noble lord is referring to on a private occasion be part of the crown copyright <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed in the response of the noble lord <e> <s> i thought that in committee we were moving towards some community of interest if not a meeting of minds <e> <s> on this side of the house we shall support whatever needs to be done in crown copyright to ensure the defence of the realm and national security <e> <s>

what publication means is vital in interpreting the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords does the thrust of the noble lords amendment mean that a board minute of a board properly constituted produced by the secretary of a company and signed by the chairman and normally conforming to the articles of association but without a seal is not valid <e>", "<cs> my lords why does the company seal have to be affixed with any assignment of copyright <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for introducing the amendments <e> <s> they correspond to similar amendments that he moved earlier <e> <s> i too was surprised that they did not occur in the grouping which crossed the frontiers of the bill but i assumed that the arrival of the noble viscount lord long on the government front bench meant that he would be responding to this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord but i do feel there is a certain inconsistency in treatment of different parts of the bill and it is a matter on which as the noble lord knows we concentrated in our discussions and to sonic extent in committee <e> <s> we shall return to some of these amendments at a later stage of the bill

perhaps did not understand exactly what he said <e> <s> first do the government intend to retain a golden share arrangement in the merged company if the merger takes place <e> <s> secondly is the noble lord aware that the director general does not have to have regard to overlapping interests he has to have regard to the criteria defining public interest set out in the fair trading act <e> <s> it is under those criteria that the director general should be looking at this merger <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining what this series of amendments is all about <e> <s> i speak to the same grouping also <e> <s> i am afraid that when the amendment was tabled and we looked at it we missed the point and thought that it was nothing more than a drafting amendment <e> <s> however it appears that it is an amendment of substance so we shall have to read what the noble lord has said before we are able to comment seriously on it <e>", "<cs> i beg your pardon my lords i should have mentioned at the outset that i was indeed speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> which is an amendment along the same lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for

amendment was inconsistent with the other <e> <s> however the government did not oppose the grouping so i did not see why the opposition should do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i shall certainly read with care what he has said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear that these are drafting amendments <e> <s> i was beginning to think after my last experience with a government amendment that i had missed something yet again <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> we shall not oppose it <e>", "<cs> my lords there are clearly sharp divisions of opinion on the benches opposite on this matter <e> <s> it is for the government to make their case <e> <s> we had a discussion in committee as your lordships will remember and i made reference at the time to the submission from westland plc which impressed me with some of the extremely serious arguments that it made about the length of time required for design right protection <e> <s> i am not saying that westland is the only company in the world and no doubt the government have received representations from other companies on the same lines or indeed on different lines <e> <s> but in this case since we are dealing with a new right it is for the government to make their serious case for the time limit that they impose <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for his explanation of this somewhat hardy amendment the government having now woken up to the fact that they had excluded the crown from a rather important ability <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not quite understand the procedure adopted by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> he spoke to his amendment no <e> <s> which was called <e> <s> he made

house that is not correct <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving his amendment no <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone drew my attention to the wording of subsection of this clause which seems to me to be rather difficult to understand <e> <s> i can understand the wording <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that a curious piece of english and if for no other reason i would support the noble lords amendment to cut out to a material extent <e> <s> quite apart from the other arguments which the noble lord adduced it seems to be better drafting of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we appreciate what the noble lord has said and why he wishes to effect the changes that he has proposed <e> <s> i cannot quite understand why the government produced the original version of the bill in the first place and why they have now changed their mind <e> <s> i did not understand what representations had been made to the government to make them change their mind <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord can help us on that <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord points out these are amendments that reflect amendments your lordships have already approved <e> <s> i have only one question <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will bear with me <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i too find the logic of the noble lord lord monson rather difficult to follow <e> <s> perhaps the minister can answer this question how effective are the new arrangements under the financial services act for detecting and prosecuting in insider dealing cases <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the problem is not so much whether this is an arrestable offence or what the prison sentence is but whether the mechanism for detection and subsequent prosecution is effective <e> <s> it was lamentably ineffective under the previous regime when the stock exchange reported to the dti as the noble lords predecessor at the government dispatch box has pointed out <e> <s> are the present arrangements any more effective <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord draws attention to clause of the copyright designs and patents bill before your lordships house <e> <s> is it a question of money <e> <s> is it a question of the government designing the right financial package which will bring the ec trade marks office to our shore or are there other factors which will come into play <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree with the noble lord lord auckland that the finnish banks have made a substantial contribution to the financial market here in london <e> <s> would he further give us some figures if he has them in his brief on the balance of manufacturing trade between finland and the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house whether similar protection is afforded to analogous emblems such as the united nations symbol and the red crescent which is also used in time of war for protection <e> <s> what are the arrangements in those cases <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept my apology for jumping up rather quickly <e> <s> is he aware that the union jack has been hijacked by the party opposite as its emblem <e> <s> by what authority was

discussions in committee we on this side of the house oppose this amendment <e> <s> the point on which the noble lord and i do agree is that the agrochemical industry is an important industry and this is an important amendment <e> <s> we differ in thinking that the amendment would have a beneficial effect as the noble lord appears to believe <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i have a certain sympathy for the amendment moved by the noble earl lord stockton <e> <s> i am concerned in particular in clause about the order-making powers to which the minister referred on the previous amendment <e> <s> the minister pointed out quite correctly that under clause as drafted the secretary of state may extend the uses for which licences of right can be abolished by order <e> <s> there does not seem to be any provision on how this order might be treated by parliament whether it is by negative or affirmative procedure by what criteria the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord very kindly repeat the section of the patents act to which he referred <e> <s> was it section or <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a great pleasure having these debates on this particular topic because the same noble lords seem to pop up from roughly the same benches and say more or less the same things <e> <s> as the noble lord lord lucas pointed out we have had this particular debate twice on the bill introduced by my noble friend lord northfield and i believe that this is the second occasion on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been round this course many times and we have all had our say <e> <s> i have nothing to add to what my noble friend lord rea said <e> <s> at the time of the committee stage we were hopeful that the government and the opposition could reach common ground around the amendment the noble lord has moved <e> <s> i hope very much that that will be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords whereas in the noble earls previous amendment i was not prepared to intervene and am happy it was accepted i must advise him that this amendment will not receive the support of the opposition <e> <s> it seems to us to be returning to the laws of the previous century and perhaps even before then <e> <s> to insert in this bill something that would change the whole basis of the patents act would be quite incorrect <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will resist it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord stockton has correctly divined my attitude towards amendment no <e> <s> d <e> <s> i am reluctant that such words as the prescribed period should be omitted in the primary legislation thus permitting the secretary of state to determine the period that he chooses <e> <s> as to amendment no <e> <s> c and the suggestion regarding one month what is one month between friends <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear the ministers reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble earl lord stockton has a very important point here which i hope that the minister will attend to <e> <s> as the noble earl says the matter is extremely technical <e> <s> i am not a patent lawyer i must say here that i miss very much the presence of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran or indeed of any noble lord on the alliance benches but i do believe that the amendment of the noble earl might be taken quite seriously by the minister when he comes to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords my name appears as the fourth name on this amendment which signifies in the usual manner that it has the support of the opposition front bench <e> <s> in winding up for what i shall call our side i should like to thank the many noble lords and those from the benches opposite in particular who have spoken in very moving terms about the hospital and have supported this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was particularly right to mention the work done for the hospital by lady callaghan <e> <s> we hope and trust that that work will continue with the same enthusiasm and dedication that she has brought to it hitherto <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for explaining the amendments which consist of a fairly big chunk and need considerable analysis <e> <s> he has as he said met the commitments he made in committee and we are grateful for that <e> <s> we have no problems with what he has said <e> <s> i have just one small question which concerns amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> can he tell us what the expression nearly resembling a trade mark means <e> <s> i am sure that there is some definition of this but perhaps he can help with the interpretation of what it means <e> <s> clearly some people will wish to know rather more precisely what the law means than i can understand at the moment <e> <s> if he can satisfy us on that point then we shall be happy with the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express to the noble lord the long-range appreciation of my noble friend lord morton of shuna for the amendments that he has proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords how will the government ensure that the public are aware of which firms may not do business after st april <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his response which does not exactly answer the question that i asked <e> <s> will he tell <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us why other expressions of interest are so commercially confidential <e> <s> after all the rover group is apparently available for sale <e> <s> that has been known for some time <e> <s> is it not the case that there have been and continue to be other expressions of interest and that these are being pushed aside by the government <e> <s> to return to my original question is that consistent with the fiduciary duties of the rover group directors and the government <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that in this advertisement the post office is advising the public not to deal with the giro bank since the giro bank handles credit transfers quite properly as it was set up to do <e> <s> in advising the public that it does not think credit transfer is a good idea is not the post office depriving its subsidiary of business <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the noble lord lord brabazon for introducing the order which he has discussed <e> <s> i am grateful to him for separating the orders into their own components because they cover different aspects of the financial services act and its implementation and because some of them raise rather contentious problems about the operation of the act and the present state of affairs if i may put it that way in the regulation of the city of london <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but since he was kind enough to talk about this act i have to apologise that i thought it was under the affirmative procedure rather than the negative procedure <e> <s> i now recognise that it is under the negative procedure <e> <s> perhaps the minister can tell us whether the government are prepared to consider the arguments of the noble lord lord boardman although we are not debating this particular measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening again <e> <s> section refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will again be grateful to the noble lord for moving the acceptance of the draft order <e> <s> it would have saved a lot of trouble if we had had a statutory body in the first place rather than an organisation which is alleged to be a private body to which certain functions can be delegated <e> <s> nevertheless i shall pass over that point as it is an old argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and i shall certainly read through what he has said i hope he will also read through what i have said on the subject <e> <s> if he has any <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will again be grateful to the noble lord for presenting this draft order <e> <s> in his introduction he has answered one of the questions that i had as to whether section would still apply <e> <s> the answer is yes <e> <s> i think it is important for the house and the public to know that fact <e> <s> i hope that he will confirm my understanding of what he said that this order covers secondary offers as well as primary offers i think i understood from the text of the order and from what he said that it did and i trust that he will confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may point out to the noble lord that the phrase may be referred to in the companies act but because we have a new act defining financial services and investment exchanges which goes into great detail about what a recognised investment exchange is and what criteria it has to meet to introduce an expression from the companies act the consolidation of which was before the financial services act introduces a term of art which existed before the financial services act but which is not relevant to the financial services act itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that my memory of this large act is insufficient <e> <s> will the noble lord point me to the schedule or section in the act which mentions exchange of repute <e> <s> i am sure that he is right but i have forgotten about it <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to my noble friend lord peston for introducing this debate on a matter which is now recognised as being of the highest importance but which was not recognised as such or years ago <e> <s> judging from the debate it is a matter on which all noble lords agree <e> <s> there is unanimity in the house that we must concentrate intensely on this important problem <e> <s> as the noble lord lord russell of liverpool and my noble friend lord irvine of lairg have said is getting closer and the skills that we shall then require in the internal market are not those traditionally associated with british management <e>", "<cs> this amendment moved by the noble lord lord diamond and supported by the noble lord lord ezra brings us to the first of a series of amendments designed to modify or in some cases to achieve explanation of the provisions of clause which i believe is probably the most difficult clause in the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble earl referred to a timetable which the government have in mind <e> <s> perhaps he would like to suggest some date other than that mentioned by the noble lord lord diamond <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble earl has been impressed by the arguments of the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i also hope that he is going to be impressed by some of the arguments that i am going to make <e> <s> i do not necessarily believe that the formulation put forward by the noble lord is the exclusive one <e> <s> we need to have clear laws as the noble lord said <e> <s> we need to know what a proposal is and not merely to know to whom it is made with great respect to the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> we also need to know in what form it is made and how it is made <e> <s> then we can say this is a proposal under the public utility transfers and water charges act <e> <s> if the noble earl is going to look at the suggestion put forward from his benches perhaps he will look at the suggestion of introducing some kind of formulation to describe how we can identify a proposal which is under this bill <e> <s> if the minister can give us that assurance i am quite happy <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for going i suppose half-a-step down the road which i believe both the noble lord lord renton and i and others would wish him to go <e> <s> let us hope that in the course of his reflections between now and report stage that he can go further along the way <e> <s> i hope he recognises that there is a major problem <e> <s> as the noble lord said if we are going to clarify the law let us at least try to make it clear <e> <s> we from this side would certainly wish to have a clear definition of what constitutes a proposal under this particular bill <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will be able to come up with one before the report stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to the minister for expanding his brief on the intentions behind the legislation <e> <s> indeed he said more or less what the noble lord lord belstead said at second reading <e> <s> it is perfectly proper that he should repeat what the noble lord said <e> <s> however if i may say so with the greatest respect that has nothing to do with the problems raised by the proposed amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> a moment ago he referred to proposals coming before parliament in the form of the main legislation <e> <s> are we to understand that the word proposal as used in this clause means the main legislation when it comes before parliament and that is the proposal which the secretary of state will make <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may pursue the argument a little <e> <s> i think that the noble earl has not fully grasped what i said <e> <s> there is of course no intention to set a flotation price at the time of transfers <e> <s> that would be absurd <e> <s> i hope that i did not appear to suggest that <e> <s> transfers between the public sector bodies for no consideration of course as the noble earl rightly says are matters that do not require a particular accounting expertise although a certain expertise is involved <e>", "<cs> surely the noble lord has heard of a true and fair view which is the normal audit report <e>", "<cs> i do not know where we are going in this discussion <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond has put his finger on the difficult point that we do not quite know what the proposals are <e> <s> the noble earl is saying that he cannot make proposals until the bill is passed <e> <s> yet the bill specifies that the secretary of state shall make proposals <e> <s> in these circumstances i do not know what we mean by the word proposals <e>", "<cs> in other words historic accounting with an addition of current cost accounting <e> <s> is that what the noble earl is saying <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl take my word for it that that is what the water authorities do now <e> <s> will he recognise that in historic cost accounting the historic costs which water authorities use in their balance sheets are the historic costs at the time of transfer under the water act <e> <s> will he also take my word for it that the accounting profession as a whole believes that those historic costs i will not say that they were mythological or invented had very litttle to do with the historic costs of the assets being transferred <e> <s> will he further take my word for it that the financial services act no less will require that if historic cost accounting is to be used a proper historic cost has to be set up for the assets of the business otherwise it will be a misleading document <e>", "<cs> we shall have to return to this at a later stage <e> <s> i hope that in the meantime the noble earl will have given a great deal of thought to what we have said this afternoon <e> <s> as i interpret the mind of the noble lord lord diamond and as i know my own mind i am determined to return to this at a later stage because i am entirely dissatisfied with what the noble earl has said however elegantly and courteously he replies <e> <s> i do not think the content very serious if i may say so <e> <s> i believe that before he goes much further the noble earl and the government will have to think very hard about the matter <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl will refer to his noble friend sitting on the conservative privy council bench who probably knows more about water authorities than anybody else and also what historic costs mean in the context of the water industry <e> <s> i am sure that he will receive benefit and very useful advice <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sure the whole committee will sympathise with the thrust of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> we certainly do <e> <s> i recognise what the noble lord lord nugent has said about the future arrangements for controlling the environment in respect of the water industry and related matters such as sewage <e> <s> nevertheless the bill covers not only the water industry but the electricity industry as well <e> <s> lord diamonds amendment will embrace both <e> <s> the electricity industry gives rise to a whole host of environmental problems and only recently we have had very direct experience with one example <e> <s> perhaps i may speak parochially for a moment and mention the subject of welsh sheep <e> <s> the explosion of chernobyl affected us particularly badly in that respect <e>", "<cs> we support the thrust of the noble lords amendment <e> <s> in my second reading speech i made certain comments about the south of scotland electricity board and its apparent desire to ask for tenders for supplies from foreign coal producers <e> <s> if those tenders were accepted by the south of scotland electricity board the remaining part of the scottish coal industry could be put out of business with a consequential serious loss of jobs <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> do i now understand that there are three things basic proposals proposals and related proposals <e> <s> that is what the noble earl seemed to imply <e> <s> the basic proposals have already been made <e> <s> the industries have been consulted and therefore they are not allowed to do anything more about that <e> <s> the bill also mentions the secretary of state making proposals and then there are other things called related proposals which are more detailed in the words of the noble earl <e> <s> i hope that my understanding is correct <e> <s> i am bound to say that i am slightly confused about the various natures of the different types of proposals that we now have on offer <e>", "<cs> at this point i must intervene <e> <s> do i understand the noble earl to say that the basic proposals that is the proposals that the government have already made in the white paper constitute proposals under this bill <e>", "<cs> i understand the latter point <e> <s> i am referring to clause a where there is a proposal for the transfer <e> <s> can the noble earl confirm my understanding of this matter <e> <s> he is trying to eliminate one set of proposals and i am very grateful because we have enough sets of proposals <e> <s> can he confirm my understanding that the suggestions that have been made by the government <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> we are now getting somewhere in understanding what this is all about <e> <s> in other words we are saying that the period of consultation is over that the deed has been done and that the proposal since there is one proposal in clause a has been made in respect of the electricity industry in england and wales the electricity industry in scotland and the water industry in england and wales <e> <s> those proposals are unalterable in the governments mind because the bill as drafted does not allow utilities to argue against them <e> <s> those proposals having been made there will be other related proposals which will come and which will be of a rather more detailed nature <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> that was the clarification which i was seeking <e> <s> this is a confused clause <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that response <e> <s> it does not get us much further <e> <s> however i understand that the minister has difficulty in explaining exactly what matters connected with means other than saying that they are matters connected with <e> <s> the explanations become slightly tautological <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for his response which clarifies the matter in part <e> <s> will he enlarge a little on his response and answer my first question <e> <s> let us take the water authorities and let us suppose that the water authorities and the nra split up a function and the secretary of state makes a proposal <e> <s> in order to trigger the powers under the bill to what extent will he have to define those rights and liabilities which are transferred from water authorities to the nra or alternatively from water authorities to the new plcs <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> perhaps i may ask a supplementary question <e> <s> given that the relevant utilities are able to influence or secure modifications of the related proposals with which i understand we are now dealing will the result of their attempts to secure modifications be published in some manner before the legislation comes before parliament or will we not know what is happening until the main legislation comes before the chamber <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i understand now it is only when one gets into the detail of the bill that one starts to understand that these are part of the related proposals and therefore clearly for discussion and negotiation between the different parties involved <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> that clears up the major point that i wished to raise <e> <s> but as the noble earl said it does not clear up the minor point <e> <s> that is a matter which will come forward in the main legislation <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i understand him to say that it is a technical necessity to have this particular wording <e> <s> can the minister respond again to my initial question <e> <s> do the government envisage the creation of new functions for a body corporate in which certain property rights and liabilities are vested <e> <s> that is a possibility <e> <s> it is not a possibility if a simple transfer takes place <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl understands the thrust of my question <e> <s> we start off with a water authority <e> <s> the water authority has certain properties rights and liabilities <e> <s> these are transferred to a company <e> <s> that is a very simple and straightforward transaction <e> <s> the successor company exercises rights over the properties and it fulfils responsibilities <e> <s> it has rights and liabilities <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> may i make sure that i have the situation absolutely right so that it is beyond peradventure of misunderstanding <e> <s> the government do not envisage other functions for the water plcs other than those <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i would not try to tie him down more than i can possibly achieve at this point <e> <s> i understand what he is saying <e> <s> i believe he has added a very interesting gloss to the provisions of the bill <e> <s> it is not the intention of the government at present to do certain things namely to widen the functions <e> <s> obviously parliament can pass what amendments it likes to the main legislation to ensure that other functions are added on <e> <s> as i understand the noble earl it is not the present intention of the government that water plcs should do more than accept the property rights responsibilities and liabilities that are transferred from the water authorities at present <e> <s> i am most grateful for that clarification <e> <s> i will certainly remember it when we come to debate the main legislation as i am sure we will in the course of time <e> <s> in the meantime <e>", "<cs> i was not aware that the government took such careful note of the time and date in which they made clarification of their own legislation <e> <s> at whatever time it is the government speak for the government <e> <s> it is always interesting to hear these particular nuances added to what has already been said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> can he respond to my two points <e> <s> first there is a question of doubtful constitutionality in a public utility being given powers to promote the interests of a private company which may at the end of the day become part of a water plc or an electricity plc <e> <s> secondly can he say whether it is right that a public utility as a public utility and before the transfer takes place should be preparing the flotation of the transferee company <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to press the noble earl but i do not seem to be getting answers to the two questions that i asked <e> <s> perhaps i can put them in a different way <e> <s> let us suppose that with the best will in the world privatisation does not take place <e> <s> perhaps the market is not ready and nobody wants to buy <e> <s> for one reason or another the selling of the water authorities or the electricity boards does not take place <e> <s> who will pay for the preparation for flotation of a successor company that is not floated <e>", "<cs> i understand all that but what if the flotation does not take place <e> <s> who will then pay <e> <s> will the consumer of water or electricity pay or will the government offer some form of indemnity and reimburse the utility <e>", "<cs> i am not looking at it in a negative a positive or a neutral way <e> <s> i am trying to understand why parliament should be invited to give powers to utilities to spend money for purposes which may be desirable or undesirable the noble earl and i have strong political differences on that point but which nevertheless are in the hands of fate the stock market and so on <e> <s> that is the point i am trying to make <e>", "<cs> clearly if there is no underwriter because there is no flotation then it cannot be the responsibility of the underwriter <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to press the noble earl on this matter but it is possible for a body corporate which for the purposes of argument we shall call a company when the water authorities activities have been transferred to it to turn itself into a holding company create subsidiaries and then to create sub-subsidiaries or to engage in joint ventures because all companies do this <e> <s> it does not seem to be necessary to provide for this situation before a transfer takes place because unless there is some catch which i do not understand a body corporate properly constituted under the companies act can be any number of things and spawn any number of subsidiaries after the event <e>", "<cs> it is possible indeed it happens every day of the week for a company to turn itself into a holding company and form what the noble earl has referred as a core subsidiary <e> <s> it is a very simple procedure so long as one has per cent <e> <s> of the shares and it takes about half an hour <e> <s> i see no difference in what the noble earl is saying that we must have the core subsidiary empowered to be promoted and so on and also the holding company <e> <s> if you put the activities of a water authority or an electricity board or whatever it may be into a company that company provided it is a company properly constituted under the companies act can turn itself as long as it has the approval of its shareholders into whatever it wishes <e> <s> for example it can be a holding company it can form a core subsidiary a core sub-subsidiary or even form core subsidiaries should it wish to do so <e> <s> so in <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> as i said the amendment is self-explanatory <e> <s> the consumers seem to be rather sadly ignored in much of this legislation <e> <s> we should like to see them put into clause <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if the noble earl found this amendment confusing <e> <s> i hope he understands that when drafting amendments we do not have the services of a battery of civil servants <e> <s> we try our best to convey to the government exactly what our intentions are without having the services of officials <e> <s> in my introducton i tried to explain exactly what our intention was <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble earl does not accept any of the arguments which the noble lord lord diamond and i have advanced <e> <s> if i may say so he seems to be in a very negative mood this evening <e> <s> he no doubt has resist or reject written across all his briefs <e> <s> it is an important point that if the main legislation is not approved for whatever reason we shall have a bill on the statute book which is complete nonsense if our amendments are not considered <e> <s> however i shall not press my amendment and i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for his explanation of the intricacies of ministerial responsibility <e> <s> it complicates the implementation of the bill <e> <s> nevertheless i am content to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> does that mean that the occupier is charged for the water that the squatters have used <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to differ from the minister it is exactly the scope of the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord airedale has put his finger on the problem <e> <s> however i can see that the minister is not prepared to enter into the discussion now so we shall have to refer to it again at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for his reply <e> <s> as he said he goes a long way towards satisfying our concerns <e> <s> they are genuine concerns that people who have not given their consent to these trial schemes should be caught up in something that is not their fault <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble earl refered to this amendment earlier <e> <s> we agree that it is obviously a desirable amendment to make <e> <s> it does not of course fulfil the purpose of the original amendment that we were discussing on clause <e> <s> nevertheless i believe it shows willingness to move in the direction of the general philosophy that the noble earl was advancing <e> <s> the government are sensitive to the requirements of consumers and we shall not oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> i use the expression regular because i mean regular <e> <s> regular can mean once every week every year or every five years but it must he regular <e> <s> that is the point i was making that there should be some sort of mechanism <e> <s> if the noble lord lord renton went into the matter he might find that with modern meters it is possible to test much more easily than with old-fashioned meters <e> <s> indeed that is what will make metering viable because there are electronic methods of testing <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for what he has said <e> <s> it certainly goes a long way to satisfying our concerns in moving these amendments <e> <s> there has been i am afraid some confusion on the groupings <e> <s> my list is different from the list of the noble lord the deputy chairman of committees but no doubt that will be rectified in due course <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm press reports that a number of companies have not been able to establish themselves in the north-east due to lack of factory space and that is the complaint <e> <s> since we are all so concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord young for introducing the bill which although short two clauses is of great importance <e> <s> the secretary of state made a wide-ranging speech some of which i hope he will forgive me for saying i have heard before <e> <s> your lordships will also have heard it before <e> <s> i suspect however that the bill although short is not wholly innocuous <e> <s> it marks the end of a bipartisan policy which has existed for many years between governments of both parties and which we on these benches believe has had a good measure of success <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer my question about regional selective assistance the assistance scheme going through the profit and loss account whereas the rdt is a capital grant <e> <s> is it possible to make the assistance scheme a capital grant <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the virtue of british airways or any other company for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the noble lord but in the dti white paper the noble lord lord young of graffham announced that there would be a voluntary process of clearances for mergers <e> <s> will the minister say what will happen if there is a voluntary clearance under united kingdom law as it then will be which is then opposed by the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for making this statement <e> <s> the british aerospace shareholders will no doubt think that christmas has come rather early this year <e> <s> on our side we believe that this constitutes an abandonment of the governments fiduciary duty to the taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one question of fact <e> <s> will the noble lord reply to my <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the government for their response to the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> i shall speak to the same group of amendments as did the noble lord lord beaverbrook <e> <s> if i may say so it seems to us that the response goes only half way <e> <s> we were looking for a protection under the main copyright part of

events is absolutely accurate <e> <s> we tabled an amendment to this effect and the noble lord was kind enough to say that the government found some merit in it <e> <s> i am sure that the drafting of the government amendment is sharper than our own <e> <s> we are very happy not to oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a great deal of difficulty with the definition of photograph as the noble lord said in his introduction <e> <s> many of us are guided in this rather technical area by the noble lord lord brain who has been kind enough to send me copies of correspondence he has had with the government <e> <s> i am also guided by my noble friend lord kilbracken <e> <s> therefore i have no particular points of substance <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a good deal of debate on this matter as the noble earl quite rightly pointed out <e> <s> on our side we have looked at the suggestion that the noble earl made at report stage about a possible general licensing scheme <e> <s> our advisers find considerable difficulty with this kind of scheme <e> <s> if the government are minded to consider further what the noble earl has to say i believe that we on our side would find difficulty in going along with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we understand the purpose of the amendment and we are sympathetic to that purpose <e> <s> however i wonder whether it may not be better covered and perhaps improved by inserting an expression such as part of the work in clause <e> <s> clause appears to allow fair dealing for the purposes of research or private study <e> <s> i assume that the noble viscount has in mind research or private study not abstracts produced for purposes other than research or private study <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagined that to be research or private study <e> <s> perhaps there is a definition with which i am unfamiliar that is not covered by the expression research or private study <e> <s> it is not that i am unsympathetic to this but i am endeavouring to define the terms of the discussion <e> <s> if what i say is true the amendment may be unnecessary <e> <s> on the other hand if what i say is not true and the noble viscount has

a rather different matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> in his reply to my amendments nos <e> <s> and in words much better constructed than those which i used he explained exactly the reason for the amendment namely that when issues of a rights nature are made and if the government wished to maintain their shareholding the government should be able to subscribe and that is the proposal in my amendment <e> <s> he said that it was most unlikely that the government would wish to acquire shares on the market because that would not benefit anybody other than the selling shareholder in i think he said grey times <e>", "<cs> that is exactly the point that i was going to make so there is no difference of opinion between myself and the noble lord <e> <s> all i am saying

right that you should do so because the finance bill itself ranges very far and wide <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord care to exercise his privilege and tell the house where he stands on the

of england from its obligations as buyers of last resort in last years fiasco <e> <s> does he not further agree that the sensible and elegant solution which he might wish to pass on to his noble friend the secretary of state and which might perhaps solve the problem of the noble lord lord belhaven and stenton who i understand has been financially damaged by what has happened since is for the bank of england now to live up to its obligations and acquire the kio holding at the price it was then prepared to offer <e> <s> would not that solution prevent a false market in bp shares protect the

library of this house <e> <s> our library was only alerted to this yesterday by myself when i asked for the figures that the noble lord had promised <e> <s> is he aware that the department described this failure as an administrative error <e> <s> does the minister accept that it makes the task of opposition rather difficult in this house if we cannot get access to figures that have been promised

of amendments that have come from the commons perhaps i may make three general remarks about our proceedings this afternoon and perhaps this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords for the convenience of the

<e> <s> i shall read carefully what he has said as no doubt will the legal profession and we shall be quite clear about what is meant <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments proposed by the commons as the noble lord pointed out leave out the expression broadcast for general reception which the noble lord said created a number of problems <e> <s> it seems to us that leaving out that expression also creates a number of opposite problems if i may put it that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his explanation <e> <s> i shall certainly turn off my radio should i be unlucky enough to hear anything that the noble lord says on his car radio <e> <s> i shall not report it to labour party headquarters in walworth road <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments seem to be perfectly satisfactory except on one point <e> <s> i refer to amendments nos <e> <s> and to which the secretary of state spoke <e> <s> i am uncertain on how far it is possible technically to decide what is not interactive <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that these amendments are generally desirable and <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if i speak to the group of amendments that the secretary of state has outlined which includes my amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> we embark here on one of the rather controversial subjects of this bill <e> <s> whereas we may be discussing copies of computer programs at the moment the noble lord was right to point out that back-up copies or copies in electronic form spill over into copies of other works and bring us into the area of what i shall generally call the blank tape levy question <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two different views as regards that article of the berne convention <e> <s> no doubt the noble lords legal advisers in the department take one view while my advisers take a slightly different one <e> <s> it is as i think he said in his opening remarks a slightly grey area of <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i wish to reply to the debate on amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> the noble lord the secretary of state in his opening remarks on the grouping in my view produced only one argument against this amendment <e> <s> that was the multiplicity of units that would he involved and the difficulty of ensuring the practice of giving authors their proper rights <e> <s> i think my noble friend lord willis has dealt with that <e> <s> there are many other instances and sectors of the copyright business where that problem is overcome <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no indication in the document but as the noble lord knows perfectly well these documents are discussed in pre-green paper form with representatives of all sorts of people <e> <s> my understanding is that this is something which at the lower level i am not saying it has been approved by the council of ministers or anything like that commands popular support <e> <s> such comments are not put into european green papers on any subject which i have anything to do with leaving aside copyright or patent in competition law unless they have been aired with governments of other countries at the official level <e> <s> i believe that to be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am usually accused of speaking too loud in this house <e> <s> perhaps it was because i was turning my head towards the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to refer to amendment no which is grouped with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have one simple and rather unimportant question <e> <s> why is the definition of dealt with included only in clauses and and not in clause where it seems to us that it should occur <e> <s> is there some reason for that which has escaped our attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord but i find it difficult to agree with him <e> <s> commons amendment no <e> <s> uses the expression subsequently dealt with and does not explain what dealt with means <e> <s> commons amendment no <e> <s> uses the expression subsequently dealt with and says <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> i apologise <e> <s> it was a question of which page we had reached and i had not turned to the next page <e> <s> i withdraw all the comments i made <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter which the noble lord has explained to the house is about overriding copyright and a contract which can be negotiated that might restrict or may include licence to copyright <e> <s> i think that the problem with the whole question of overriding rights is best set out in the judgment on the recent <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move my motion a that the house do disagree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord strathclyde and to other noble lords who have participated in the debate <e> <s> without impertinence i should like to offer advice to the noble lord opposite <e> <s> he would do well to avoid references to my honourable friends in another place <e> <s> at the outset of todays proceedings i announced that we were dealing with the matter on a non-partisan and non-political basis <e> <s> throughout i have tried to keep the discussion as open as possible <e> <s> if i happen to disagree with an honourable friend in another place or if he happens to disagree with me or if the government happen to disagree with one of their back-benchers that is perfectly in order on a bill of this nature <e> <s> i hope that party political constraints will not enter into the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining the amendment in detail because it was one about which i had some doubts as i think i gave him notice of the other day <e> <s> my doubts concerned the underlying copyright ownership and indeed the subsequent assertion of moral rights by those who may be anonymous or pseudonymous authors of the words or who may have discovered the words somewhere in a case where the recording was made and put into an archive and someone somewhere pops up out of the blue and says i wrote those words or i wrote that music and i want to assert my moral rights <e>", "<cs> my lords does this mean that if i go along to an archive and say that i should like to use the folk song which is in the archive for whatever purposes i may wish there will be an opportunity for someone to assert both copyright and moral right <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the fact that the noble viscount lord falkland has tried hard to separate the different issues involved in his amendment i believe that we are right in the middle of the question of time-shifting whether in sound or in video <e> <s> my noble friend lord willis raised the question of the blank tape levy <e> <s> it is difficult to disaggregate the various issues although i appreciate that the noble viscount was trying to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but is the noble lord going to restrict himself to the subjects which the noble viscount has raised or is he also embarking on the extension that i introduced in the light of the noble viscounts comments that we are in a seamless robe situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the ministers reply to my amendment <e> <s> perhaps he will answer my question before he goes on <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> reads <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case if amendment no <e> <s> is accepted would it be proper <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies to the noble viscounts most recent and eloquent submission i should like to follow one particular line of questioning which i have been pursuing <e> <s> the noble lord was kind enough to say that one recording only is involved <e> <s> are we to assume that if a broadcast is repeated which frequently happens a second recording can be made namely a recording of the repeat broadcast <e> <s> if the broadcast is repeated a third fourth fifth or sixth time can we assume that on each occasion a recording can be made and six recordings can therefore be used for private domestic use <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord can respond to my question <e> <s> i declare an interest as chairman of the academy of st martin-in-the-fields an orchestra which records extensively <e> <s> its recordings are repeated extensively through broadcasts <e> <s> i would be interested to have a response to my question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> a to commons amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the secretary of state has been kind enough i claim no personal credit to say that we have introduced a certain number of modifications to the bill <e> <s> this amendment which he has indicated that the government are prepared to accept extends the category of handicapped people deaf or hard-of-hearing to others such as autistic children downs syndrome children and others who for one reason or another will find proper therapy in the alteration of <e>", "<cs> my lords in general we are quite content with the amendment <e> <s> the only clarification i seek from the noble lord relates to the identity of the author <e> <s> the problem is that an author could adopt a pseudonym or initials or some other designation which might give rise to confusion <e> <s> for example my name is charles williams and there are other authors who are called charles williams <e> <s> the noble lords name is david young and no doubt there are other authors called david young <e> <s> his initials my initials and other pseudonyms which we may adopt are legitimate and quite proper <e> <s> the question on which i should like clarification is how does the appropriate authority detect whether a pseudonym or the name is the right one for the purposes of assertion of moral rights <e> <s> it may be no problem but i should be grateful for clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords we wholly agree with the thrust of the commons amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the secretary of state what would happen if there were a pseudonymous contributor to a royal commission report <e> <s> he might like to answer my previous question in the light of the question i have just posed <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a small clarification point <e> <s> on death is there the possibility of partial transfer of copyright that is between heirs or is that ruled out by the commons amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too shall speak to the same group of amendments <e> <s> noble lords will recognise the fact that during the passage of the bill through this house and another place we on these benches expressed worry about the question of moral rights and the consent and waiver of such rights <e> <s> i must once again reiterate the opinion that the new moral rights provisions are now circumscribed by such a host of exceptions as to afford the new protection in only fairly unusual and in our view peripheral cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall also speak to the grouping specified by the minister <e> <s> my particular worry is amendment no <e> <s> which concerns the role of the secretary of state on recommendatons of the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> it appears as a new clause after clause <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord continues with his answer <e> <s> i am very grateful for the answer to my first point <e> <s> the minister will undoubtedly know that section of the fair trading act is a very general clause containing a whole series of different criteria with varying degrees of precision if i may put it like that <e> <s> the noble lord himself and his predecessors as secretary of state at the department of trade and industry have made many ministerial pronouncements as regards what guides the monopolies and mergers commission in its interpretation of section <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the secretary of state <e> <s> i take issue with him on one small point about the interpretation of the fair trading act <e> <s> i speak from memory and so i could easily be wrong <e> <s> i believe that the monopolies and mergers commission is required to report under section of the act <e> <s> it is not just a question of references <e> <s> the monopolies and mergers commission is governed by those criteria <e> <s> secondly i understood from the secretary of state that the berne convention may well become we hope not evidential material in a united kingdom court if there is judicial review about the satisfaction of the minister under clause <e> <s> i think that one has to accept as a fact of life for ministers that the convention will be interpreted by a united kingdom court <e> <s> i may be good it may be bad but i think that that is now established <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that the noble viscount had spoken to the motion of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for moving this amendment since it gives me an opportunity to speak to the grouping to which the secretary of state spoke when he introduced amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may press the noble lord on his reply <e> <s> we have before us a commons amendment which restricts the power of the copyright tribunal to the extension of a licence or otherwise <e> <s> the original clause allowed the tribunal to vary the terms of the licence <e> <s> on the other hand the extension of the licence is subject to a possible variation in the terms of the licence from the tribunal <e> <s> therefore the tribunal is entitled to vary the terms in extension but not during the original period <e> <s> this seems to be wholly illogical <e> <s> i cannot understand why the government have adopted this sideways position on the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me perhaps i may put one or two supplementary points <e> <s> the question of varying the terms of a licence while it is in operation is something that we now understand will not be permitted to the tribunal <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord will be able to tell me in what circumstances the tribunal will be able to vary a licence and what is the point of the whole procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords that could easily be the case during the period of the licence <e> <s> the economic circumstances may have changed <e> <s> the contractual circumstances may not have changed but by extending the period of the licence simply by that one clause in the contract which says that the licence shall run from december to december to say that a licence shall run from december to january or february changes only that one clause in the contract <e> <s> the other circumstances may not change <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought the noble lord was to speak also to a further grouping including amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if i am wrong i will reserve my comments <e>", "<cs> my lords the question raised by amendment no <e> <s> is what is the definition of on any point of law <e> <s> i ask the noble lord whether the proceedings of the tribunal i can almost answer the question before i start would not themselves be open to judicial review in the sense that the tribunal is required to interpret its remit as required by statute <e> <s> if that is the case and since it is required by statute in this bill to interpret existing licences when giving judgments about licences of a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i did not realise that this was the way to avoid judicial review and i understand now that that is what is intended <e> <s> nevertheless my point remains that if the tribunal is instructed under the bill before your lordships and when it is enacted under the act to have regard to the terms of comparable licences which apply in another part of the bill which i cannot recall is that procedure when a judgment is made upon a licence a point of law or is it something else <e> <s> can the matter taken to a higher authority or not <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> what we have now established in respect of the tribunal and existing licences under the bill is that matters of fact and interpretation can be taken to a higher authority namely the high court or the court of session <e> <s> therefore what is the point of simply having a point of law down here <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state is right <e> <s> we asked for these amendments and we are grateful that the government have conceded them <e> <s> on a point of clarification what is the position of a train going through the channel tunnel <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to speak to the same group of amendments as detailed by the secretary of state <e> <s> i have no problem with any of these amendments other than amendment no <e> <s> which is an amendment to schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish the noble lord lord strathclyde to go into a very detailed technical explanation of these amendments <e> <s> however as i understand it a qualifying performance now inlcudes performers with rights who happen to be in the european community and not simply in the united kingdom <e> <s> therefore in talking about appropriate consent one is talking about the consent of a sicilian tenor or a guitarist from malaga or whoever it might be <e> <s> it seems to me to be stretching appropriateness appropriate consent and consent being unreasonably withheld which is understandable in united kingdom law rather more <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord i fully understand what he is saying <e> <s> the performer will not give his consent lightly or easily <e> <s> but the performer nevertheless has to give his consent <e> <s> and he has to be found to give his consent <e> <s> that is where i think the problem is going to arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to return briefly to the point that i was discussing earlier with the noble lord concerning a performer who unreasonably withholds his consent <e> <s> if the performer in question is not a resident in the united kingdom and he may be found or not found what is the jurisdiction of the tribunal in determining whether this performer who may reside in germany italy france or indeed anywhere is unreasonably withholding his consent <e> <s> is it by his absence by his failure to attend <e> <s> where is the resolution of this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords my question was what is the jurisdiction of the tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has raised one or two interesting points of a general nature about design right <e> <s> the group of amendments to which the secretary of state has spoken offers me what is perhaps the last chance to say and to put on the record that we do not believe that the unregistered design right is a necessary construction <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell me what is the difference between a part in a kit and a part supplied on a must-fit or must-match basis <e>", "<cs> my lords how am i to know whether a part which i am buying is part of a kit of parts or a part supplied on a must-fit must-match basis <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it in this set of amendments the secretary of state is going to have powers with the consent of the treasury to fix the remuneration of the adviser <e> <s> is this the deregulation on which the secretary of state is so keen <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> covers the question of groundless threats <e> <s> can the secretary of state tell the house why groundless threats appear to be relevant in design right and registered design right but not in the case of copyright <e> <s> there seems to be an inconsistency here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that we have come back to <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> is an extremely important amendment to the registered design act <e> <s> it deals with the restoration of a lapsed right in design <e> <s> it is vital in my view that the matter raised in subsection of the new clause to be inserted into the registered design act should be fully clarified <e> <s> the question is what is the reasonable care that the proprietor should have taken before the registrar will decide that the lapsed design right should be renewed <e> <s> i am worried about the writing into this kind of legislation the expression reasonable care without an indication from the minister of what is intended <e> <s> perhaps he can help <e>", "<cs> my lords that is all very well but we are dealing with the registrar ordering the restoration of the registered design provided that he is satisfied that the proprietor took reasonable care to ensure that the period was extended under the provisions of the registered designs act <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble

should have thought that dormant companies would be de-authorised if i may use that vulgar expression by whoever is required to authorise them under the financial services act and similarly under the banking act <e>", "<cs> my objection is simple <e> <s> the noble lord has said that these are minor amendments but they may be major <e> <s> if a company is dormant in other words if it is not active

those companies which are dormant under this legislation <e>", "<cs> under those circumstances if the bill said that the registration or authorisation would be removed from the companies then we have a meeting of minds <e> <s> however to say that dormant companies may not pass such a resolution if they are banking or insurance companies or an authorised person under the financial services act and this is a deliberate amendment to the present companies act seems to be otiose <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but which opposition amendment is he referring to <e>", "<cs> which

entitled to make his interventions from a sedentary position if he so wishes <e> <s> however for the moment i am speaking from the dispatch box and i should like the opportunity to do so <e> <s> we are trying seriously to discuss clause <e> <s> this is an important point <e> <s> i hope that he will pay attention and not shout and scream <e>", "<cs> i am glad to hear it <e> <s> the issue of how people elect not to receive full financial statements and to receive summary financial statements is one of considerable importance <e> <s> we believe that it should be positive rather than negative <e> <s> shareholders should be asked to sign a form or whatever is the appropriate mechanism to say that they do not wish to receive a full financial statement <e> <s> they should not be presented with some forms asking them to consult the bank manager or to seek professional advice with an option saying if you do not fill in a form saying that you wish to receive the full financial statement you will not receive it <e> <s> our amendment addresses that point <e> <s> the bill as drafted does not <e> <s> the bill refers to <e>", "<cs> that is all very well but the noble lord and the

they should be entitled to do so <e> <s> i have no problem in that connection <e> <s> however it must be a positive decision and not a negative one <e>", "<cs> i can reply to that by saying to the noble lord accept my amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord chandos is right <e> <s> i accept that the noble lord is tired and that we must move on <e> <s> i do not think that we shall make much progress <e> <s> the noble lord has not understood our arguments <e> <s> we shall have to do what we can when the bill comes to report <e> <s> i shall not be moving amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> as i said i am grateful to the noble lord he has had a hard day <e> <s> we shall certainly not press the amendment but i hope that in the intervening stages the government will look at

beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord like to withdraw his last remark <e>", "<cs> it was very rude <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the noble lords remarks <e> <s> they go no way at all to satisfy my ambitions of getting this whole business out into the open <e> <s> i do not believe that the number of banking institutions that take advantage of this is small <e> <s> i do not believe that the old leach-lawson rules which the noble lord lord benson will remember very well are at all adequate <e> <s> i believe that banks ought to show in their accounts a true and fair view <e> <s> that means full openness in transfer to reserves and full provision for their debts <e> <s> but i do not believe that this is the time of night and the right occasion to pursue this particular argument <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to disappoint the deputy chairman but i wish to make one or two comments <e> <s> the provision is technical but it reflects on the schedule and introduces a certain number of modifications to the schedule as drafted <e> <s> i hope that the government will consider in the light of events and the time of night whether the wording in amendment no <e> <s> is precise enough to carry the approval of the committee at a later stage <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just add my voice to that of my noble friend lord bruce of donington and those of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and the noble viscount lord caldecote <e> <s> in his first reply to my noble friend the noble lord mentioned the problem of bank accounts <e> <s> as he will know last night if i may put it that way did not move a series of amendments dealing with banking companies <e> <s> however will the provisions under this section deal with bank accounts and the bank problem that i foreshadowed on second reading and raised again last night but did not press <e> <s> if that is the case why do we not simply pass a bill saying that the secretary of state shall do whatever he feels necessary to make whatever regulations he feels appropriate for any company to do whatever it likes in accounts <e> <s> it seems to me that if we are going to do this we must make the primary legislation a little more specific than the government have at present <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong the debate because i am most grateful to the noble lord for what he said <e> <s> however does that mean that all the amendments i tabled on the question of bank accounts transfers of any reserves and a true and fair view of banks are otiose because the government have power to do whatever they want under the bill as drafted <e>", "<cs> i am grateful the noble lord and again i must say that i do not wish to prolong the debate <e> <s> however it seems to me that changing the status of banks as to whether they should provide a true and fair view in their accounts as opposed to their accounts being in conformity with the legislation is a major change <e> <s> if the secretary of state wishes to take those powers we ought to know about it <e>", "<cs> the point that i am trying to impress upon the noble lord is that we on this side i believe that i speak not only for the opposition but for noble lords in other parts of the committee would like to have the same privilege as professional associations and others when a draft order is put out for consultation by the department <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his exposition of what part ii is about <e> <s> generally i agree with his exposition <e> <s> i am grateful to him for responding to some of the points i made <e> <s> the minister is absolutely right in drawing the attention of the committee to the point that the institutes that are operating in this sector at the moment do not support the amendment that i am moving <e> <s> nevertheless i say to them that if they want i believe they do a flexible system of monitoring it is my belief that that can only be achieved by a statutory body with practitioner participation at the top <e> <s> otherwise the noble lord is going to lead us as the bill does down the path of a very firm secretary of state with primary legislation and stipulating what is required <e> <s> those institutes will then have to monitor on a statutory basis <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does not wish to comment on what i said <e> <s> having invited him to do so i rest my remarks simply where they are <e> <s> i do not believe that the institutes for which the noble lord lord benson speaks will have much joy from this side if they ask for flexible monitoring underneath without a proper regulatory system on top <e> <s> i take what the noble lord said <e> <s> this is a difficult matter <e> <s> it goes to the heart of part ii of the bill <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord explain why we have the new version auditor of the company in this amendment while in amendment no <e> <s> we have a new version which incorporates the words company auditor <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord benson has spoken to amendments nos <e> <s> a to d together <e> <s> i should like to follow his example in so doing <e> <s> the noble lord put forward a persuasive case for the inability if i may say so of the existing institutes to have laid upon them the burden which this schedule implies <e> <s> previously i expressed my sympathy with the noble lords view <e> <s> it seems to me that a statutory requirement on the supervisory bodies which in practice will be the various institutes to both monitor and enforce compliance of their rules lays them open to action if they do not so enforce <e> <s> i sympathise with the noble lord when he says that the institutes really do not have the resources to carry out that statutory obligation <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble earl will allow me to say from these benches as opposed to a pronouncement from the government benches that the bill is designed to implement the eighth directive <e> <s> that means that the present situation cannot continue <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply briefly to that point <e> <s> we must go over to a system which is embodied in law <e> <s> that is the directives requirement <e> <s> my point is that the monitoring of auditors is conducted either by supervisory bodies which is what the bill proposes or by some general statutory body which the secretary of state will set up and to which he will delegate his powers <e> <s> i do not see that there is the middle course as described by the noble lord <e> <s> there may be one it escapes me for the moment <e>", "<cs> i find myself in the embarrassing position of defending the government <e>", "<cs> very regretfully <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord benson decides what to do with his amendments i wish to clarify one point <e> <s> is the noble lord lord brabazon ruling out or ruling in the system of peer review that exists in the united states <e>", "<cs> i hope that the profession will advise the government to rule it out <e> <s> it gives no satisfaction to firms and very little satisfaction to those who use auditors services <e>", "<cs> following on from what the noble lord lord lloyd has said i want to ask the minister exactly what form the consultations with the profession will take and what their result will be <e> <s> will there be a modification to the schedule <e> <s> will guidance be given <e> <s> what will happen as a result of the consultations <e>", "<cs> i too shall speak to the grouping to which the noble lord lord lloyd has <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord this is not a new point we have been discussing it for the last minutes <e> <s> what actually happens if the secretary of state decides that someone with qualifications in another country is not fit to conduct an audit in this country <e> <s> what mechanism is there for that decision and hence what mechanism is there for the appeal <e>", "<cs> i certainly did not mean to mislead the committee in any way whatever <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord for the point he has made <e> <s> i am trying to make precise the conditions under which the secretary of state has to operate when giving his approval or non-approval and what recourse an aggrieved party has <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point about our amendment and i shall not press it <e> <s> i can only express some surprise that the wording in the companies act which was erroneously included on consolidation has subsisted to this day without any challenge <e> <s> that seems a rather extraordinary phenomenon <e> <s> nevertheless i accept what the noble lord has said and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> if i may say so i hope his advisers and officials will agree i do not think that accepting my amendment as it is would be in contravention or lead to contravention of article of the eighth directive but that is for the government to decide <e> <s> in the meantime i am grateful to the noble lord for his consideration and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have a problem with clause <e> <s> it is very widely drafted indeed <e> <s> as far as i can see the secretary of state can require any institute to give him any information as long as he can demonstrate that it is for the purposes of this part of the act as it will then be <e> <s> as we have already established this part is extremely wide and be could ask an institute reasonably for justification for a german or indeed a russian auditor or anything else <e> <s> secondly he may require that information to be given to him in the timescale at the moment and in the place that he specifies <e> <s> i am not trying to quarrel with the need for the secretary of state to have the ability to call for the information but does the clause have to be drafted quite so widely <e> <s> are we not as a chamber of parliament under some obligation to make sure that the secretary of states the executives powers are in some way qualified so that he cannot simply say i want this that and thus to be delivered to my office in hours and that is the end of it <e> <s> he has the statute to back it <e> <s> that is the burden of my complaint about clause <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran

the noble lord <e> <s> lord benson for setting out his point of view so clearly and convincingly <e> <s> from what my noble friend lord peston said on second reading i believe that members of the committee will be aware that we support the case put forward by the noble lord and we hope that the rather delicate balance which was struck on immunities when the financial services act was before

role as the sros under the financial services act and should have the same rights and privileges as well as the same duties <e> <s> logic demands that the government accede to that which the noble lord asks <e>", "<cs> my lords we are most grateful to the noble baroness for taking into account our feelings in committee and for bringing forward this amendment which satisfies us as regards the amendment i moved in committee <e> <s> i never like to look a gift-horse in the mouth certainly the noble baroness cannot be described in those terms but our discussion in committee ranged somewhat

details of legislation by regulation and having a schedule which is part of the primary legislation <e> <s> however the financial services act a piece of new legislation according to the noble lord in a moving market we did not know at the time it was a bill what the result would be set what in our view has become an undesirable precedent of having great chunks of primary legislation amended by statutory instrument which this place does not have a chance properly to consider as it does primary legislation <e> <s> that is a worrying tendency <e> <s> it is a worrying tendency in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the secretary of state <e> <s> i understand what he says about the initial undertaking and the initial announcement but the bill states in new clause hc <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to pursue this argument too far because it is a minor amendment <e> <s> if the words had read <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord morris has raised an interesting and technically difficult point

cover broader terms <e> <s> no doubt the secretary of state will comment on that matter <e>", "<cs> can the minister expand on part of his answer and respond to the point which i and the noble lord lord morris were trying to make <e> <s> it was that there are different kinds of inquiries and investigations which run in counter currents to the takeover procedure <e> <s> for instance the takeover panel has certain powers to investigate market dealings as under certain statutes has the dti <e> <s> i shall not quote any cases but it could easily be that the results of an inquiry by the takeover panel or the <e>", "<cs> this is part of a larger debate as to the role of the sib which we shall come to in due course <e> <s> this is not the time to engage on that and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> am i right in thinking that section of the financial services act which concerns the provision of misleading information recklessly or otherwise carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment <e> <s> further is that not exactly the problem which we are addressing in this clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will reflect upon this problem for a moment <e> <s> as i understand it having read section of the financial services act anyone who provides misleading information whether recklessly or otherwise suffers a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment <e> <s> however anyone convicted under this clause of providing false or misleading information in what after all are very similar circumstances can receive a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment <e> <s> there seems to me to be an inconsistency between the two <e> <s> therefore i very much hope that the noble lord will reflect upon the matter <e>", "<cs> i wholly agree with the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i am not trying to introduce seven years into the bill <e> <s> i am trying to ensure consistency between the treatment of <e>", "<cs> as i tried to explain to the noble lord lord kilgerran i am not trying to put seven years into the bill <e>", "<cs> it is a probing amendment to see whether the government have compared the provisions that they are putting into clause with section of the financial services act <e> <s> i should prefer section of the financial services act to have a penalty of two years <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that because i cannot amend the bill in that respect <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it is a point of consistency <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it is not a biblical conversion if i may say so to the noble lord <e> <s> as always i am extremely reasonable <e> <s> whenever possible i try to help the government <e> <s> on many occasions it is not possible and i oppose the government <e>", "<cs> at considerable length <e> <s> in this case it seems to me that the negative procedure is probably the right one <e> <s> in that spirit should i withdraw the amendment <e> <s> will the noble lord consider it <e>", "<cs> in that case i will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with the greatest of respect the noble lord has not started to address the problem that my noble friend lord peston put to him <e> <s> the proposal is to reduce the mmc panel from five to three members <e> <s> however in almost every bill that comes

the bill <e> <s> i hope he will accept that consultation on this part was limited <e> <s> there may be very good reasons why consultation was limited <e> <s> it was extremely useful for the committee to have the noble lords explanation as to exactly what this part is about <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he mentioned clause <e> <s> is this intended to cover receiverships and administration orders <e> <s> if so why is this not specifically stated <e> <s> as to subsection some clarification of relevant office-holder does seem to be necessary <e> <s> i draw attention also to the fact that under clause there arises the question of voting procedures at meetings called for the purposes of the insolvency act which seem somewhat unclear <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> no doubt he will read what l have said i shall read what he has said and we will study the matter with care <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his explanation of the governments intentions <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> or photocopies <e>", "<cs> but there must be some procedure for ensuring that they are copies of the original document and that they are not just handwritten reproductions of the original document <e> <s> there must be some evidence that they are copies of the original document <e> <s> is that not the case <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> my problem is that the word copies can mean several things <e> <s> it can mean an authenticated properly signed copy or it can mean that a copy of the marshalled list in my own handwriting is a copy of a certain document <e> <s> all i am trying to establish is what the government mean by saying copies <e>", "<cs> i fully understand that there is no guarantee <e> <s> there is a certain difficulty here but no doubt that can be resolved <e> <s> it is not for the committee this evening to resolve such a difficulty across the floor <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hasten to assure the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that this is a probing amendment rather than an amendment designed to trespass upon important legal matters north of the border <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> in all cases where the normal procedure is overridden by the bill we shall require government explanations as to why it should be so <e> <s> the noble lord has given the governments explanation at which we shall look most carefully and at a later stage if we feel that it is necessary we shall return to the matter <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> we are making a great deal of progress with the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as i hope i have pointed out on numerous occasions these are probing amendments <e> <s> we are not trying to remove subsections of the bill but trying to establish what the governments intentions are <e> <s> the noble lord has set out the intention of the government <e> <s> i hope he will accept that the principle of a court having discretion if a transaction is not <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the noble lord by reinterpreting what i am saying <e> <s> we accept that contracts with third parties

in our view it will be of some detriment to creditors <e> <s> if clauses and are taken together they will mean that claims which might otherwise be avoided will be settled within the default procedure <e> <s> assets which would otherwise be available to creditors would be lost <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i wonder whether he will kindly write to me to explain whether there is any precedent in english law regarding the ability to take a charge on indeterminate assets to an unspecified person <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> again we will read what he has said and put on the record and may revert to it at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that certainly investment is cross-frontier <e> <s> of course we acknowledge that there will be cross-frontier trade in the motor industry <e>

"<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will agree that uncertainty of all kinds should be removed <e> <s> will he accept the offer from the opposition that when the government admit that they are wrong and produce a bill to amend the act in order to fulfil the council directive not the commission directive we in the opposition shall give it a very fair wind <e>", "<cs> as i said at second reading we are sympathetic to what the noble lord lord jenkin proposes <e> <s> my amendment which i do not intend to speak to in any great detail is on the same lines <e> <s> i accept that perhaps it is not so well drafted as that of the noble lord lord jenkin but the objective is the same particularly with regard to the sib <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> i am sorry i accept that i got the two muddled up <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord include members of the opposition among his group of noble lords who have been proved to be right <e>", "<cs> we on these benches are quite prepared to adopt the suggestion of the noble lord lord carr of hadley that we should postpone <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> through the usual channels we have written out the pencilled dates produced by the noble lord lord morris <e> <s> it is true that we shall have one day at report stage before easter and the recess <e> <s> after that there will be space

a debatable motion <e> <s> when we come to it we may find that there is such a motion and i am sure that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran will bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may remind the noble lord that we cannot amend commons amendments when they come back to us <e> <s> we can only approve or disapprove <e>", "<cs> we can table alternative amendments <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that

invests through a unit trust <e> <s> presumably he is no longer a private investor <e> <s> the unit trust is the vehicle and is therefore the professional investor <e> <s> am i right in that

<e> <s> however we accept that the department of trade and industry will do its best and we look forward to the draft regulations coming before us <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords was this report released to the monopolies and mergers commission when that body studied the minorco-consgold merger <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the case why did the

of uranium which is processed by british nuclear fuels <e> <s> is it the case that british nuclear fuels receives uranium ore concentrate from customers processes it and re-exports it <e> <s> if that is the case does that mean that uranium which may be marked n could be processed in britain and re-exported with a different codification <e>", "<cs> my lords is that also true of re-exports to the soviet union for whom british nuclear fuels does a great deal of processing <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a great pleasure for your lordships to hear a maiden speech from a law lord <e> <s> it is a particular pleasure that the noble and learned lord lord oliver of aylmerton has chosen his maiden appearance in your lordships house to introduce a report with which he is associated and for which his noble and learned friend lord goff of chieveley as chairman of the committee that produced it was responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house what proportion of output of the aerospace industry is attributable to british aerospace and rolls-royce <e>", "<cs> my lords would any reference to the monopolies and mergers commission be under the airports act or under the fair trading act <e> <s> if it is under the airports act can the minister explain the role of the director general of fair trading <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware that the budget red

of kilgerran <e> <s> the noble lord lord lloyd has a serious point in regard to the difficulty of defining what is a subsidiary and what is an undertaking <e> <s> this runs through the whole bill and we had many discussions in committee on this point <e> <s> indeed the fact that there are two different versions of what is a subsidiary causes confusion in the lay mind and even in the minds of legal experts such as the noble lord lord lloyd <e> <s> i am glad however that the drafting of my amendment is more acceptable to the government than that of the one we moved in committee <e> <s> i hope that having noted what the noble lord lord lloyd said about the difficulty of defining subsidiary the government will accept my thanks for adopting amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reply first to the secretary of state on the question of the role of auditors <e> <s> i do not believe that the role of auditors is a matter of great political philosophy <e> <s> we from the opposition have not moved and passed the financial services act which lays the role of policeman on auditors <e> <s> we from the opposition have not moved and passed the banking act which lays the role of policeman on auditors <e> <s> we from the opposition have not moved and passed the building societies act which also leaves the role of policeman fairly and squarely with auditors <e> <s> the government have laid burdens on auditors in successive pieces of legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that this is a useful amendment <e> <s> it clears up a difficulty which was previously mentioned <e> <s> we have no problem with it <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches support the noble viscount in his amendment <e> <s> i do not wish to spend a great deal of time answering some of the points that have been made <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne that the report and accounts of a company are not simply for shareholders <e> <s> in my view they are for potential shareholders for creditors and for all kinds of people who are interested in the affairs of the company in question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i misinterpreted the noble lord <e> <s> i had the impression that he said that the report and accounts were solely for shareholders <e> <s> they are of course for the world in general but primarily for shareholders <e> <s> nevertheless they are also for creditors and for potential shareholders <e> <s> in the united states it is becoming very clear that potential investors in a company pay much more attention than they used to to the research and development programme of a company <e> <s> analysts are now used to commenting on this <e> <s> they assess companies by their rd performance <e> <s> so it is very important that the analyst or the person who recommends an investment should have proper information <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble viscount <e> <s> did not a number of public companies disregard the ssap on current cost-accounting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> the intention behind my amendment was to draw the attention of the government to the oppositions views on the dearing report and to encourage the government to bring forward appropriate amendments as early as possible so that your lordships may have an opportunity to discuss them <e> <s> i understand the thrust of what the noble lord is saying in reply <e> <s> in the light of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i accept what he says about explanations <e> <s> it is always rather difficult for directors to engage in explanations about why things were different to what was shown in their original accounts <e>

views on the amendment that i have put forward <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> we are making progress with this bill <e> <s> a number of opposition amendments have been accepted in principle <e> <s> i look forward to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord strathclyde and to the noble lord lord mottistone whose sharp eye as always has picked out the mistake in the drafting <e> <s> he is right and is also right to draw our attention to it <e> <s> this amendment was tabled with a certain amount of haste so that the government would have plenty of time to consider their reply <e> <s> in doing so we missed out on the drafting <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble lord says about belgium not implementing the provision <e> <s> however let us suppose that a united states company resident in belgium has no par value shares as is allowed in the united states and the belgium company has no par value shares <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i shall not press the amendment but i should like to point out that in the bill we are in danger of winding ourselves up in different definitions <e> <s> we have had two definitions of subsidiary in different parts of the bill <e> <s> we have generally accepted accounting principles which i agree occurs in the companies act and we have statements of standard accounting practice <e> <s> we also have the statute <e> <s> we are in danger of complicating life by having too many provisions trying to cover the same subject <e>", "<cs> my lords we are quite happy with the amendments that the government have now put forward and indeed with the explanation which the noble lord lord strathclyde has given as to why my noble friends arguments could not prevail <e> <s> we are embarking here upon a discussion of the treatment of minority interests and potential consolidation <e> <s> i should prefer to have that discussion when we reach amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> for the moment therefore i do not oppose the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords we too welcome the amendments <e> <s> in general they follow the line we are taking in committee <e> <s> however i should like to make one or two points <e> <s> i hope that the secretary of state will be able to clarify them when he comes to respond <e> <s> so far as i can see the expression proportional consolidation is new to the statute book and is not defined in the bill <e> <s> it could mean two things <e> <s> it could mean that a company will show its proportionate share of assets and liabilities adjacent to but separate from its own balance sheet in other words one has two columns one is the balance sheet of wholly owned or wholly consolidated assets and liabilities and the other is the proportionately consolidated assets and liabilities or it could be that there will be a combined total of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the distinction between what is fully owned or fully consolidated and proportionately consolidated is not made but merely translated down to the bottom as minority or joint venture interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that it is <e> <s> i suspect that the partnership can be controlled and an unincorporated association can be controlled in the same way as a subsidiary <e> <s> i do not see that that point is relevant nevertheless am prepared to listen to what the secretary of state says in reply <e>", "<cs> my lords presumably if it is joint and several responsibility then it is joint and several responsibility for all liabilities and they become the liabilities of the organisation and so there is still consolidation at that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord strathclyde for giving what he describes as a full explanation of the government amendment <e> <s> it needs a full explanation because this is an exceedingly complicated part of the schedule <e> <s> i am not sure even now whether i fully understand what the noble lord said or the purport of the government amendment <e> <s> nevertheless it is an issue which we shall examine carefully <e> <s> if we have any major problems we shall come back to the matter on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very surprised that this amendment is necessary <e> <s> i should have thought that the expression the net assets and profits or losses to be taken into account by itself eliminates all consolidation adjustments <e> <s> i am baffled as to why the government seek to introduce more wording into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for setting out these amendments and to the government for bringing them forward because they respond to the concerns that we showed in committee <e> <s> we therefore welcome them <e> <s> as the noble lord has said they go slightly further than even we had asked for and i think that is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his clear statement of the governments position <e> <s> he and his right honourable friends in another place will certainly have to argue this out <e> <s> i hope they can advance rather stronger arguments than the noble lord has advanced today <e> <s> if they cannot they will be in some trouble <e> <s> no doubt the government will consider the position in another place <e> <s> if in another place a decision is taken to reverse what your lordships have put in the bill no doubt your lordships will have another opportunity to consider this matter <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for not taking advantage of a technical slip on my part for which i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the secretary of state for his comments <e> <s> i understand that these amendments were tabled at a fairly late stage and the government may not have had a chance to look at them in as much depth as they would like <e> <s> i tabled the amendments in order to raise a point <e> <s> i think the noble lord has taken the point <e> <s> as he has given us an undertaking that he will study the amendments without any commitment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord strathclyde for bringing forward this amendment <e> <s> as i am sure noble lords will agree it is extremely important to be absolutely clear regarding the scope and content of the auditors report <e> <s> we emphasised that point when the bill was before your lordships in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that explanation <e> <s> i am not sure that i fully understood it <e> <s> perhaps he will be kind enough to write to me and let me know the full position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am glad that the government have consulted on this matter <e> <s> i accept their word that no representations were made by any of the various bodies concerned with the profession <e> <s> i confess to being slightly surprised by that but if that is so then i believe that the matter should be left there <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving us some inkling of what the secretary of state will produce in the regulations <e> <s> i find it odd that we have spent a great deal of time discussing what should be in the directors report and accounts indeed what is in the directors report and accounts is on the face of the bill yet we shall not even have the possibility of looking in draft at the summary financial statement <e> <s> there seems to me to be a disproportion in those two facts <e> <s> nevertheless we shall consider the matter <e> <s> i do not intend to press the amendment at this time of the evening and at this stage of the bill <e> <s> we shall certainly look at the matter again but i cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords are there more redundant words in the bill

the case for instance in scotland the same conditions can apply <e> <s> partners can walk out and take the practice with them and set up their own partnership as a separate legal person <e> <s> presumably under those circumstances the original partnership would not be considered to have a continuing role as auditor of the company <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps he can answer the point on what happens in a scottish partnership if say three-quarters of the partnership walk out of the partnership and form their own partnership taking their own clients with them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord spoke to that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the secretary of state for moving amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord who said before the adjournment that he had something to say about amendment no <e> <s> will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down could he give us some sort of timing on when the amendment will be brought forward <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him whether it is always her majestys governments policy to provide minimum safeguards only under directives <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak to amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble lord lord benson and also for the convenience of the house to my amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> this group of amendments tries to achieve the same objective <e> <s> schedule to the bill seems to impose on the recognised body a duty to have adequate arrangements and resources for the effective monitoring both of technical standards and of competence among its members <e> <s> i am reluctant to accept that it should be written into statute that any organisation be it the institutes of england wales or scotland or any other organisation should have tasks imposed on them which it is impossible for them to fulfil <e> <s> it seems to me that what paragraph of schedule to the bill imposes is impossible for the institute to fulfil <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord recognise from what he has said even before it is fleshed out to use his own words that he is starting to institute an enormous bureaucracy which involves forms being filled out and spot checks being made <e> <s> this will impose an enormous burden on firms and indeed on the institutes in their capacity to recognise bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords we are glad that the government have produced these amendments <e> <s> we support them <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am sure that he understands the point that i tried to make in committee and am trying to make now <e> <s> we hope very much that the government will complete the consultations they have embarked on as quickly as possible so that we have an opportunity to discuss <e>", "<cs> my lords after our discussions in committee i think that the government recognised that this was the right solution <e> <s> i am glad that they have brought forward this amendment which we support <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for this group of amendments which certainly clears up a curious drafting anomaly in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord help us by defining in these circumstances who an officer or servant is <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i am sure that he will recognise that there is a problem here <e> <s> it may be technical but an inspector can divulge or disclose information to anybody provided that he or she can claim that he or she is an officer or servant <e> <s> before allowing this to go through on the nod as it were i should like to be assured that there is some provision that an officer or servant is defined quite clearly in law so that not everyone can walk in from the street and claim to be an officer or servant of an inspector and obtain information which the inspector has available <e>", "<cs> my lords overseas regulatory authorities have been the object of some debate in committee and also of correspondence between government ministers and myself <e> <s> i accept that the amendment that the noble lord is moving goes some way to meet our problems but it raises the problem of banking which is a rather specialised activity information on banking should not be divulged to anybody except under the proper circumstances

to my question <e> <s> at the outset i wish to say that i regret the use of this house for personal attacks on people who are not members of the house <e> <s> i believe we have to deal with this matter on a reasonably rational basis <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government cannot agree with my noble friend lord mason can they give a response to sir robert haslam who in a recent statement to the coal industry society said that the consequence of post-privatisation generators relying on imported coal was that there would be a dramatic effect upon the united kingdoms balance of payments and there would be yet another round of closures of uk collieries <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness said in response to my question that privatisation might not have any effect on this <e> <s> is she not aware that the electricity bill gives the secretary of state the power to control all fuel stocks <e> <s> but the government have stated that they have no intention of restricting cheap fuel imports and that the current joint understanding between british coal and the electricity supply industry will be abandoned <e> <s> is that not tantamount to saying as the noble baroness herself has said that the government will encourage coal imports <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that we on this side of the house support a programme of government incentives to encourage japanese investment here provided of course it is complementary to our own indigenous manufacturing industry or whatever industry is involved and not destructive of it <e> <s> furthermore does the noble lord accept that in south wales particularly japanese companies have shown a policy of good neighbourship which we very much appreciate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord also recognise that there is nothing wrong in subsidies and that there is no wrongdoing let alone a clearly disclosed wrongdoing <e>", "<cs> my lords how does the noble lord reconcile what he said about regional policy with the cut in real terms announced in the recent public expenditure white paper of million <e> <s> is that an adequate preparation for <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord both for his introduction to the amendment and his welcome of my noble friend lord carter to our front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will qualify a small point for me <e> <s> is there in any sense a separate registry for scotland rather than for england and wales which includes scottish terms such as heritable securities whereas the registry for england and wales does not or are we talking about a registry for the whole of the united kingdom which includes any security which in scotland is deemed to be a heritable security <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may be allowed to ask him three questions on the substance of what he has said <e> <s> first is it the case that the whole of part iv would have to be altered as he seemed to imply if the certificate were made conclusive in the way that the amendment of the noble lords lord mottistone and lord lloyd of kilgerran propose <e> <s> secondly is it just a question of clerical oversight the word used by the minister if the register is wrong in some way and that this is a problem that damages the certificate <e> <s> thirdly is it right to say that business will be prejudiced just because there is an unreasonable burden on the registrar <e> <s> after all the registrar is a publicly funded body which exists to help business <e> <s> is that what the noble lord is really saying <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may clarify one point <e> <s> if the registrars certificate is not to be conclusive on particulars how do we know whether the negative pledge is properly registered <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he say whether his assurance includes an undertaking to bring forward something better on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is quite right in pointing out that it was a lapse of memory on my part that i failed to move this amendment again on report an amendment i had moved in committee <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord for correcting me on that point and indeed confessing to plagiarism which is a rare event <e> <s> in supporting the noble lord i would just point out that there is a printing error in line on page of the bill <e> <s> perhaps that could be corrected when the bill is reprinted <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the government for assenting to recommitment of part v i have believed for some time that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for explaining that the amendments that have been tabled which comprise pages of the marshalled list include only a few minor debates <e> <s> nevertheless the opposition the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and our advisers will have to look at these matters <e> <s> we cannot simply nod them through <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord replies to the submission of my noble friend i should say that my noble friend is trying to say very clearly that the government go beyond the directive <e> <s> if we were to move an amendment on report which sticks literally and closely to the directive would the government accept it <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble and learned lord <e> <s> is he speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> c and c only <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble and learned lord again <e> <s> we are trying to get on with the bill <e> <s> the grouping that i agreed for the opposition was amendments nos <e> <s> c and c together <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend decides what he does with this amendment i think that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran wishes to speak <e>", "<cs> will the noble and learned lord tell us what stage his considerations have reached since committee <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord can tell us when his considerations will be completed <e>", "<cs> from the opposition front bench i should like to support the amendment tabled by my noble friend lady lockwood <e>", "<cs> i am glad to hear the noble lord lord mottistone who claims to be a spokesman for the cbi criticising me as a spokesman of the labour party <e> <s> the noble lord said that industry does not like the amendment <e> <s> he would wouldnt he <e> <s> does he speak for industry <e> <s> he speaks for the cbi <e> <s> in this house he speaks for himself but as the government chief whip knows on frequent occasions the noble lord lord mottistone says that he speaks for the cbi <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i speak for the opposition front bench <e> <s> from time to time the noble lord lord mottistone says that he speaks for the cbi <e> <s> that may be right or it may be wrong but he does so <e>", "<cs> that is a better formulation than some i have heard <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone spoke of the appointment of directors <e> <s> in my innocence i believed that directors were elected by shareholders rather than being appointed <e> <s> that is not a minor issue <e>", "<cs> i understand what the noble baroness is saying <e> <s> she is in favour of a positive policy <e> <s> i am in favour of positive discrimination and i believe that it amounts to the same thing <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say to the noble baroness that positive discrimination does not involve quotas but involves making sure that when there is a list of people that one says for example we want more people of an ethnic origin <e> <s> we want more people like that if they are suitably qualified <e> <s> i do not want to have so many ethnic directors in terms of quotas <e> <s> however i believe that we should have more people from ethnic origins on boards of directors of public companies <e> <s> however i believe that that is a problem of semantics and not the issue here <e>", "<cs> the only notable thing about the speech of the noble lord was part of his last sentence <e> <s> perhaps i may say that he was extremely sarcastic to my noble friend on the discussion of <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the noble lord has addressed the points that i made <e> <s> i accept that under his amendment preference shareholders will be able to vote on matters affecting their rights <e> <s> that is perfectly clear i can read the amendment <e> <s> but where ordinary shareholders pass resolutions which may affect not the rights of preference shareholders because they are enshrined in a document setting out the terms of the preference but the rights of certain general interests of the company they may affect the value of the preference shareholders investment <e>", "<cs> i understand that there is no question of changing the existing law and that the same rights will apply <e> <s> all that concerns me is that creditors and different classes of shareholders should have proper notice of what the ordinary shareholders decide to do <e> <s> that does not appear to be difficult to achieve <e> <s> it would help to ensure that when written resolutions are finally agreed they would not upset the creditor or preference shareholder <e>", "<cs> the minister has given away his position by saying that what would happen in the event would be that by contract the creditor would require notice of any written resolution before it came up <e> <s> that is exactly what would happen <e> <s> it does not help to have in a statute the phrase without any previous notice when by contract the whole matter will be rendered null <e>", "<cs> again i do not find those arguments convincing <e> <s> i do not understand that the words on behalf of mean in general law what the government seem to think they mean <e> <s> on behalf or means someone who is specifically empowered <e> <s> i am unhappy that the government do not accept this amendment which does not come from me but from outside advisers <e> <s> i very much hope that the government will look again at the arguments and perhaps consult more widely to see whether their position is as strong as they think it is <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are having an argument about what happens in the real commercial world <e> <s> my own belief is that once a written resolution has begun to circulate among members of a private company many other people will start to take measures if it were a relevant resolution such as to affect the creditors of the company which is what i <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that other people are not allowed to act but commercially other people will act <e> <s> for example the bank might pull the plug if it sees a resolution written and signed by nine out of members affecting its interest <e> <s> while awaiting the last signature the bank might say that it will call in its loan and that will be the end of it <e>", "<cs> i will tell the noble lord how it differs from what happens at present <e> <s> when a resolution is circulated well in advance the bank if i may use that as an expression for the general creditor has an opportunity to go to the ordinary shareholders and say that if they pass a resolution which affects the banks interest it will pull the plug <e> <s> that is why the first amendment was so very important <e> <s> at present without previous notice there will be written resolutions circulating and the bank may well say that it will take that action <e> <s> my amendment is helpful and clarificatory but if the government are going to refuse all amendments and all suggestions from this side of the committee then there is nothing we can do other than to have debates of this nature <e>", "<cs> we have had a discussion and i believe that the noble lord has registered my points as i have registered his <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> no but it would be perfectly possible to append to the letter a copy of an identical document <e> <s> it will need just one extra piece of paper to give an absolute guarantee that members know exactly what they are signing <e> <s> i see the noble lord objects to one extra piece of paper which seems rather odd because that does not seem to impose a great burden <e>", "<cs> it cannot be changed <e> <s> that is presumably what the government wish to have two pieces of paper one of which may state the resolution and the other a version of the resolution not significantly changed <e> <s> can the minister answer my noble friends question on whether a shareholder can withdraw a signature on the first document in favour of the second both of which accurately state the terms of the resolution <e>", "<cs> let me give the noble lord an example from real life <e> <s> there is a resolution which states this that and thus <e> <s> it is in specific form <e> <s> that will be one document <e> <s> there may be a letter from the chairman of the company to the members saying <e>", "<cs> on the contrary the oppositions amendments are designed to make sure that the law in its final form does not give rise to endless disputes and to make the procedure perfectly simple and clear <e> <s> however if the government are determined not to accept the amendment then the government are determined <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> can the minister tell me what will happen if a shareholder has signed a power of attorney to a third party and then revokes that power of attorney during the course of the passage of the resolution <e>", "<cs> if the last member does not sign does the resolution carry on <e>", "<cs> i do not understand how this will work <e> <s> what is the time limit <e> <s> this is a technical matter but it is important to get it right <e> <s> a shareholder may sign a power of attorney <e> <s> he is spoken to by other shareholders and the attorney may have signed the resolution <e> <s> what are the possibilities <e> <s> other shareholders may say to him it is a very bad resolution and your attorney has signed it on your behalf <e> <s> what are the shareholderss powers to withdraw the signature if he feels that he does not like the situation but his attorney who has been given the power to sign has done so <e> <s> if the resolution is held up because of the failure of one shareholder to sign does that mean that the resolution is <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i become more astonished than ever by the arguments which the government put forward in the name of deregulation <e> <s> it seems to me that amending the articles of association of private companies is the simplest thing in the world <e> <s> if there has to be unanimous agreement to a resolution to obtain unanimous agreement to amending the articles seems to me to be a piece of cake <e> <s> however the government have a majority here and in another place and if they are determined to have that procedure i have no doubt that they will succeed in getting it <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the point that the noble lord is trying to make because it appears in schedule <e> <s> that is quite clear <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may explore that point further <e> <s> so it is the auditors who have to decide it is up to the auditors to decide whether or not they are affected in some way as auditors <e> <s> therefore they might well say we think that this resolution affects the creditors of the company and as auditors we are bound to say that that could affect the companys solvency <e> <s> that is in their position as auditors is it <e> <s> it is rather different from what the minister said about the auditors right of audience at a general meeting <e>", "<cs> that is contrary to the provision in the amendment without any previous notice <e>", "<cs> because the auditors have previous notice <e>", "<cs> i do not understand how they can give seven days notice that the matter should be considered at a meeting without having had seven days in which to consider the matter <e> <s> this is an odd amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the noble lord is right in thinking that auditors do not have under his drafting a general right to ensure the effect of any resolution whether or not it concerns them as auditors <e> <s> if as auditors they decide that a resolution for example in regard to the selling of a factory or whatever it may be is something in which they as auditors can properly take an interest they can within literal interpretation of what the government have put forward in the amendment ensure that it is put into a general meeting <e> <s> the noble lord seemed to imply that my interpretation and that of my advisers of what the government propose is wrong <e> <s> if that is the case i should be grateful if he would look carefully at what i have said <e> <s> i suggest that subsection a could be reworded along the following lines <e>", "<cs> of course i am all in favour of deterring misconduct <e> <s> however i do not quite follow the noble lords argument <e> <s> if the resolution is properly signed sealed and delivered why should it be necessary to record the names of the people who signed and the signatures bearing in mind that they are all possibly signing different documents which may accurately reflect the terms of the resolution <e> <s> surely one cannot have the actual signatures in the book one just has a record of the names of the people who have signed <e> <s> i cannnot see how that provision really helps matters very much <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but perhaps i may ask him this <e> <s> does that mean as regards these signatures that each member must sign the book <e> <s> or does it mean that there is a record of the names of those members who did in fact sign the resolution <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to the noble lord that does not constitute signatures <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful that the noble lord has finally accepted that there is a problem in this respect <e> <s> in my view there is a real problem here <e> <s> we do not know whether it is the signatures themselves a record of who signed the resolution whether they must be original signatures <e>", "<cs> those companies to which the noble lord referred which merely sign the minutes at the end of the day were infringing the companies act <e> <s> they were obviously unaware of what the companies act said <e> <s> the minister referred to section of the companies act <e> <s> subsection as he rightly said allows for books but as section says they are different books of <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for at least reading what noble lords have said about this amendment in committee <e> <s> this is the last amendment that i have tabled to the government amendment <e> <s> in speaking generally to the government amendment i say that we have no objection to the principle of the matter but on the other hand as the noble lord lord rippon said it is extremely complex <e> <s> i do not understand how private companies will understand what it all says and what it all means <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend lady phillips will not contravene the law in future <e> <s> she has had an assurance from the minister that she is not contravening the law at the moment <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall have to read what the noble lord has said <e> <s> perhaps we can discuss these matters outside the chamber there is no point in continuing the argument <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> even accepting the noble lords argument for paragraph a surely paragraph b must be of concern to auditors as auditors if they are to be removed <e> <s> so is that really necessary <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that certainly paragraph b and almost certainly paragraph a are redundant <e> <s> however if the government wish to have them in the bill then they will do so <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> does this mean that a written resolution includes a draft which may change <e>", "<cs> as i understand it for the purposes of part ii of the schedule a written resolution can include a draft which can subsequently be changed <e> <s> will the noble lord confirm that i am correct <e>", "<cs> there certainly is confusion <e> <s> i shall read the terms of the government amendment <e> <s> it states that <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord simply saying that it is necessary to include these words to make the definition of relevant member clear or is he saying that the government would rather have these words in simply in order to make the legislation a bit fatter than it would otherwise be <e>", "<cs> it has just about made it clearer <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for his comments <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this one is not about whether there is a conflict of interest which is the object of amendment no <e> <s> c <e> <s> it is the timing when the resolution is presented to members about directors service contracts <e>", "<cs> i understand the noble lords point <e> <s> i am still concerned that in real life what will happen is that a service contract will form the object of a resolution which will be presented and members signatures will be required at a particular time <e> <s> it will be very difficult in the context of a private company for the last shareholder not to sign <e> <s> however perhaps the noble lord will kindly read what i have said <e> <s> i do not think we need carry this argument any further at this moment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> again i shall have to read what the noble lord has said in response to our amendment <e> <s> i am afraid that i was a bit distracted <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that it is a bureaucratic procedure <e> <s> it is simply making sure that everybody who is relevant in a broad sense should at least have a copy of the document <e> <s> if the noble lord and the government feel that they do not wish to ensure that they are entitled to feel that <e> <s> but it seems to me that the whole question in written <e>", "<cs> have i understood the noble lord correctly <e> <s> does that mean that that person is entitled to sign the resolution and that his signature qualifies but that his signature is not necessary <e> <s> is that the right interpretation <e>", "<cs> but his signature is valid <e> <s> if he signs for say per cent <e> <s> of the company he may sway the vote as the noble lord said <e> <s> it seems to me that if the signature is valid we are back to the problem the noble lords second point of whether he should be able to sign in the first place <e> <s> i believe that he should be able to do so <e> <s> when the noble lord replies to that point will he reply to my question namely whether if a general meeting were held on such a matter any shareholder could vote or whether an interested shareholder is precluded from voting at that meeting <e>", "<cs> is the noble lords belief that a shareholder is entitled to vote at a general meeting on this subject confirmed <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> he talked about the crux of the matter <e> <s> as i understand it we now reach the point at which because it is a question of unanimity whether someone has per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> does not in fact make any difference <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> explanatory of what <e>", "<cs> as i understand it and my understanding may be quite wrong the government are saying that where there are provisions in the companies act for certain procedures in general meeting of members those procedures are being adapted for the written resolution regime but where there are no procedures laid down in the companies act the government are effectively making them up <e> <s> so when the noble lord refers to section of the companies act he means that there are procedures there which have been adopted for the written resolution regime but there are no procedures for voting on directors service contracts in the companies act and there are no analogous procedures so they have to make them up <e> <s> i understand that that is what the government are trying to do <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> when looking at this problem he might also consider the companies act itself and the provisions for public companies and whether interested directors should be allowed to vote in this matter as shareholders <e> <s> as he rightly says there is nothing in that act at the moment <e> <s> it may be something that the government may wish to introduce at a later stage and perhaps in another place <e> <s> however i am grateful to the noble lord for accepting that there are worries on this side of the committee about the conflicts and for his assurance that he will look again at this matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord strathclyde <e> <s> i am sure he recognises that this is a quite difficult problem and that there is an uneasy balance <e> <s> i shall consider again as will the noble lord lord lloyd what he has said <e> <s> if necessary we can come back to the matter later <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i stand corrected <e> <s> nevertheless shareholdings change in private companies <e> <s> whereas there might have been unanimity among a group of shareholders in year one by year three with a totally different group of shareholders that unanimity may not be there <e> <s> can the election be cancelled <e> <s> does it have to be cancelled by unanimity <e> <s> how will all that work <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord strathclyde for clearing up one or two matters <e> <s> i now see that he is quite right in pointing me to new section a which we are about to discuss <e> <s> nevertheless the new minorities if there is a change of circumstances will not be able to carry an ordinary resolution to defeat the elective resolution so the problem still remains on the table <e> <s> i do not believe that there is much virtue in pursuing this argument <e> <s> the noble lord has been kind enough to give us a full justification of what the government intend so we can move on to other matters <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am glad that he will look at the matter again because the present amendment as drafted does not appear to take us very far <e>", "<cs> i find the argument difficult to sustain <e> <s> the directors of a company private or public are appointed or elected in order to serve the interests of the shareholders and to run the company <e> <s> they are entrusted with the conduct of the company <e> <s> i believe that in such matters it would be normal to have a board recommendation on a resolution and that shareholders should properly be suspicious if there is no such recommendation <e>", "<cs> if the shareholders are unanimous then they can remove the board of directors but when shareholders are not unanimous which is normally the case it would help to have a recommendation from the board of directors <e> <s> however i see that the noble lord has set his face against this amendment and i do not wish to prolong our discussions further <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this new clause is again one which allows the secretary of state by order to vary primary legislation <e> <s> we might just as well have had a new clause saying that the secretary of state by regulations may make any provisions which he <e>", "<cs> i object to the principle of this clause and not merely to the drafting although i believe that the noble lord lord tordoff is quite right in what he said <e> <s> however the principle is objectionable <e> <s> just because the institute of directors has some more ideas and wishes to persuade the secretary of state that it is right so that that can be translated into a new part of the companies act seems to me objectionable <e> <s> that is why i object to it <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord stratchlyde explains the government position perhaps i can respond to the contribution of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i accept it as a very serious contribution to what is a very important debate <e> <s> no doubt he and i have differences of opinion clearly so on this matter <e> <s> i do not believe that my amendment is a danger to companies <e> <s> as i have said i believe that it would improve companies management <e> <s> i am seeking that end <e> <s> it may be a danger to what i call if there any establishment boards of directors which are cosy and stitched up <e> <s> the noble lord lord motttistone says that there are not but there may be one or two from time to time <e>", "<cs> i accept that it is matter for serious discussion whether this is the way to achieve what i wish <e> <s> however i hope that the noble lord lord mottistone will accept that nothing sinister is intended there is no question of reds under the bed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says not yet <e> <s> here we go again <e> <s> that is a classic reaction <e> <s> almost anything that is moved by the opposition is thought to have some sinister motive <e> <s> this is a perfectly ordinary attempt as the noble lord lord peyton has said to make large and institutional shareholders more responsive to their companies and board directors more responsive to their shareholders <e> <s> as i said in my introductory remarks i believe that we should have some better method other than mergers and takeovers of ensuring that managers are kept up to the mark <e> <s> this is one of the ways of doing that <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for what he said <e> <s> indeed as he said the response he gave was not unexpected <e> <s> i hope that he and the government accept the fact that we are trying to address a problem which does exist <e> <s> moreover i think that the noble lord lord peyton indicated that there was a genuine problem in getting shareholders to be more interested in the conduct of the companies which they own rather than simply selling their shares and walking away taking a short-term view of the matter <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may clarify one point <e> <s> i do not mean to criticise the noble lord <e> <s> he has been courteous on the bill <e> <s> nevertheless many things were going around before the bill was published <e> <s> none of them came to the opposition <e> <s> the same happened with the copyright designs and patents bill the consumer protection bill and the financial services bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his response to my amendment <e> <s> i look forward to being consulted on the draft of table g as i look forward to being consulted as he promised on the draft of the esop amendments which as i understood from committee are being given the highest priority <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the point that i was making was that if the government believe that a common seal is not necessary and that documents can be properly verified and properly established without the use of a common seal why have common seals at all <e> <s> why do we have the alternative you can have one if you want or you neednt have one if you dont want <e> <s> that is what i understand the amendment to mean <e>", "<cs> but companies can still have a seal if they want apparently <e> <s> my question is very simple <e> <s> why not do away with the whole idea of company seals in one go <e>", "<cs> then how does the lawyer to whom my noble friend referred identify whether the company has properly executed a document <e>", "<cs> therefore we have to know whether the director and the secretary are properly authorised to do so by the company <e>", "<cs> i think that we must examine this further because it does not seem to be quite right <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes i think that the argument about the single director company is probably conclusive in this case <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i understand there is some kind of an inquiry taking place into this matter at the moment <e> <s> i believe the inquiry is either within the cbi or between the cbi and the government <e> <s> i have heard about that inquiry although i do not know the details of it <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord clarify that matter <e> <s> is he undertaking to bring forward an amendment in another place <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do with the amendment i wonder whether the noble lord lord strathclyde would like to say anything more about the governments intention on this matter <e> <s> is it merely to consider without any commitment <e> <s> is it to consider with commitment <e>", "<cs> i share the views of the noble lord lord peyton on section a as he will be aware from our discussion in committee <e> <s> as he has pointed out i also referred earlier this afternoon to the affirmative procedure and said that i did not think that it was very useful for us at present <e> <s> i wonder whether i speculate aloud the usual channels might try to make the affirmative procedure a little more useful for us than it is at the moment <e> <s> i intend to raise that matter from this side <e> <s> i am sure that the usual channels will operate <e> <s> i do not know whether that will be by allowing possible amendment or possible division and i do not take a position on that at the moment <e> <s> however i believe that if we are to have an affirmative procedure it must be more than just a talking shop or a debate <e> <s> we must be able to influence what goes in the order <e>", "<cs> whereas the amendment moved by the noble lord lord monson in committee was indeed rather wide i suspect that his present amendment is rather too narrow <e> <s> i should like to find a compromise between the two <e> <s> i believe that it is right to stop public companies from holding meetings on bank holidays and easter sunday <e> <s> however i think that one has to be consistent and take all bank holidays into the list of prohibited days as well as those mentioned by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord monson has said the general practice is to send out reply-paid proxies but there are exceptions to the rule <e> <s> i believe that it is sensible for the companies act to ensure that there can be no illegal exceptions <e> <s> the whole <e>", "<cs> but are not the government committed to shareholder democracy <e> <s> are not the government committed to the idea that shareholders should take an interest in the affairs of their company <e> <s> is it

democracy <e> <s> it certainly is a commitment to wider share ownership but not to shareholder democracy <e> <s> if you are a government committed to shareholder democracy you must follow that through by providing shareholders with the ability and the means to take advantage of the facilities offered by the company in exercising their proper right in interesting themselves in the affairs of the

industry saying that it is neutral with regard to this subject <e> <s> the society is perfectly happy with the present law but would be perfectly happy if the amendment were accepted <e>", "<cs> the minister will no doubt have read the consumer protection act with great care <e>", "<cs> that act deals with pricing misleading price indications and product liability <e> <s> it can have a massive effect upon a companys finances <e> <s> that is something in which auditors will have an interest <e> <s> if they do not have an interest they are not being very good auditors <e> <s> with the arrival of the consumer protection act which follows the european directive and so i agree that we must have it there are interested parties other than members and creditors <e> <s> i still maintain that it would be appropriate if an auditor feels that there is something that someone who is buying a companys product needs to know which the company is not doing and which results in the auditors removal that the auditor should be entitled to speak out <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the government do not agree with my point of view <e> <s> i do not believe that the government have even started to understand the argument <e> <s> i hope that the government will think again and look at this matter because the consumer protection act changes the role of auditors <e> <s> auditors are policemen in

they are right <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i said at an earlier stage in committee before recommitment i believe that this is an interesting and quite important point <e> <s> it may be a minor point in terms of the whole corpus of company legislation but we should do well to pay attention to it <e> <s> i am not convinced that the drafting of the amendment is wholly to my taste <e> <s> nevertheless we certainly support the thrust of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl lord cranbrook for introducing the radioactive waste

matter to which he only addressed himself this morning or yesterday because he thought that he would be unable to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should make my point clearer <e> <s> the other day i went down to hinkley point because i thought that i should at least familiarise myself with what was going on at a rather controversial station <e> <s> i was told quite clearly by all sides on

clause <e> <s> the criteria of the secretary of state on reference seemed to us to be determined by ministerial statements from time to time <e> <s> i believe that the ministerial statement still in

saying that the debates in your lordships house sometimes serve to clarify the governments mind because i have found on certain occasions that the governments mind is not entirely clear <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful to the noble lord lord brabazon of tara for bringing this amendment forward <e> <s> it responds to points we made in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have paused but i thought that the noble lord had received by carrier pigeon a message which he wished to convey to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> obviously i was mistaken <e>", "<cs> my lords i

various criteria in section to matters which can be considered along with other things which are unspecified <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord has produced an amendment which the government would do well to accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene but does leveraging come under the heading of other things <e> <s> is that what the noble lord is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords we support the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran in his amendment <e> <s> before he started speaking i had no idea he would pray in aid words of the noble lord lord hesketh <e> <s> it was an

am sorry that he is not going to take up his position on the government front bench to respond to the points that the noble lord made <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say which member of the panel represents the trades union congress <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord can tell the house whether it is proper to refer to the water act when in fact there is a water bill

this house can he explain how it happens that c appears in the rubric <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell us whether ownership and control is defined by part i or clause of the bill <e>",

committee and i oppose it even under the new dispensation for british telecom <e> <s> i oppose it now <e> <s> i feel that the monopolies and mergers commission which is now required to conduct industrial policy more or less across the whole range of industry in this country should have a proper balance <e> <s> a proper balance means more than three on a panel <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he not agree that it is better to remove the anomaly in the other direction by reinstating the five place of the three-member panels <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very welcome to see the noble lord lord strathclyde at the government dispatch box yet again particularly on a subject with which he is familiar the issue of insolvency <e> <s> perhaps i should make clear what is the oppositions attitude to these amendments because i do not wish to speak at length on the various amendments as they come forward since there are only two major points that i want to make <e> <s> i shall make one of them now <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand why the secretary of state wishes flexibility but amendment no <e> <s> m gives him almost total flexibility to do whatever he wants whenever he wants without having to come back to your lordships house or indeed another place <e> <s> yet again we find primary legislation writing powers in for the secretary of state to change what he likes when he likes and how he likes <e> <s> even at this stage of the bill i find that rather hard to swallow <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak against amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the costs of assisting the financial market in default proceedings in our view should be borne by the market itself <e> <s> the bill appears to allow for such costs to come out of the estate and hence to be borne at the expense of non-market creditors <e> <s> that does not seem right <e> <s> if there is to be an arrangement for a market clearance system that overrides the normal insolvency procedures the government surely have to justify the costs being borne by the non-market creditors rather than the market itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the list was in the bill before this amendment was tabled but can the noble lord expand a little on what this list means <e> <s> who will be on it and what are the criteria for getting on the list <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down did he imply that the government are going to bring forward an amendment to clarify what this list is about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to abuse the report procedure because i do not wish to do so <e> <s> can the minister expand on what he is saying <e> <s> are the government going to bring forward an amendment to define the criteria by which the bank includes people on the list <e> <s> what is it all about and when are the government going to bring forward this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house how many british firms took stands at the recent moscow fair <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister will answer the questions that he was unable to answer yesterday evening <e> <s> who will be on that list <e> <s> what are the criteria for getting on the list <e> <s> will the government bring forward amendments spelling out the criteria <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he tell us whether the same criteria as are in the financial services act which stipulates a cut-off in terms of size for a listed institution will operate here <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments make it easier to understand what the governments intentions are <e> <s> i am afraid that they do nothing to allay our worry about market charges as a concept <e> <s> the problem of what a market charge really is because it is a new kind of instrument still remains <e> <s> i very much hope that as the bill goes through further stages and through another place the government will think hard about the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but is he also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> m <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment for two reasons first because it shows to the outside world if it is accepted that we are absolutely clear that we are going to meet our international obligations <e> <s> it is not a question of the secretary of state may do this he shall do this and parliament has decided that is what he is to do <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems to us to be a perfectly sensible amendment <e> <s> i remember the noble lord lord hacking and i and my noble friend as he then was lord morton of shuna dwelling on the point three years ago when we considered the financial services bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he say whether that means that the amendments will not come to this house but will be tabled in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that i should respond on behalf of the banking community to thank the noble lord for his kind remarks <e> <s> there is undoubtedly a problem here <e> <s> there is some confusion in the law and the thrust of the amendment certainly has the support of bankers and certainly makes sense <e> <s> i believe that the government would do well to pay attention to the words of professor jack and adopt the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble baroness for setting out some of the basic philosophy behind the bill that we are to consider today and for taking us through its main provisions <e> <s> she did so with her usual courtesy and elegance for which we are very grateful <e> <s> i in turn shall try not to introduce too brutal a note too soon <e> <s> nevertheless i must make it clear at the outset that we on these benches believe not only that the philosophy behind the bill is misconceived but also and perhaps more importantly that its provisions in detail will turn out in the long term to be profoundly and perhaps even irrevocably damaging <e> <s> the government seem determined to persist in the conviction that generating and supplying electricity is exactly like making and selling mars bars <e> <s> given that absurd dogma it is not surprising that they have produced a thoroughly bad bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord who is to wind up for the government will correct the noble lord on what he thinks is the job of the grid <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> can he say who has advised him on the speech that he is at present making <e> <s> can he <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether among the staff of the regulator will be people who understand the price formula in the licences <e> <s> if not can the noble lord explain to the house what it means <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell me how the board of directors of the national grid company will be composed <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may tell the noble lord <e> <s> it will be composed of representatives of the area boards who are shareholders <e>", "<cs> my lords did the leader of the house move that the house should be adjourned for five minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is a debatable motion i certainly do not wish to prolong it <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord strathclyde said this is in answer to a point that we made at report stage and we welcome the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the secretary of state for coming forward <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house knows i supported this amendment at report stage because i believe that it has important implications <e> <s> i shall not go over all the arguments that i used then because they stand by themselves <e> <s> i shall correct one thing that the noble lord lord monson said simply for the record <e> <s> he reported me as saying that i was in favour of wider share ownership <e> <s> i have said on many occasions in your lordships house that i am neutral on that question <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be most grateful to the secretary of state for staying to the end of the passage of the bill and for giving your lordships the governments final message before the bill goes to another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is one point on which your lordships would be quite unanimous this afternoon and that is that we have been debating a subject of the utmost importance <e> <s> i think it was the noble lord lord roll of ipsden who said that parallel with the defence debate in europe in international affairs the question of our relationship with the community probably ranks in importance <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness agrees so forcefully with the noble lord lord mellish that the more nuclear power stations the merrier will she explain why we need pwr technology which after all is imported <e> <s> what is wrong with the british agr technology <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not possible to explain to the noble and learned lord lord hailsham that a reduction in the demand for electricity means that we need fewer new power stations <e>", "<cs> my lords will the secretary of state bring his influence to bear in so far as he has influence over the chairman of british telecom to ensure that the metering of telephone calls is accurate and that bills to customers reflect the calls which customers have made <e>", "<cs> i am of course aware of the pump storage facilities indeed coming from wales who could not be aware of such a system <e> <s> however that relates to an infinitesimal amount of electricity compared with the general amount which is transmitted through the grid every day <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for her response which i am bound to say i do not find very satisfactory <e> <s> my amendment does not seek to impose a constraint on the secretary of state other than that the gentleman or lady who is to be director should have experience in the electricity supply industry <e> <s> in my view the noble lord lord peyton was quite right to point out that it would be absurd if the government appointed to the post anybody who did not possess such experience <e> <s> but i infer from the response of the noble baroness that he or she may not have such experience the government are envisaging such an appointment as a possibility <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord has taken a very narrow point if i may say so <e> <s> again the director can have experience in all kinds of areas of the electricity supply industry <e> <s> we are talking about the electricity supply industry in the bill and it is to that that my amendment is addressed <e>", "<cs> clearly he must in some sense be responsible to or liaise with the director but it is a joint responsibility with the secretary of state so he can bypass him <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble baroness could elaborate on that last point <e> <s> for the life of me i cannot see why those words should be there <e> <s> i can see why the provision has been included in previous legislation but that is not a very good argument for putting it in this bill <e> <s> let me put the question to her very quickly <e> <s> what would happen to a director whose term of office expired if this sentence were not in the final act <e> <s> would he be ineligible for reappointment <e>", "<cs> i endorse entirely what the noble lord lord peyton said about my second amendment amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it seems to me that the government are unable to answer my question if those words were not in the legislation would the gentleman or lady in question be ineligible for reappointment <e> <s> so far as i can see the answer is no and he or she would be perfectly eligible for reappointment <e> <s> i do not therefore see why we need those words <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord say what a relevant misbehaviour is <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may enlighten the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i am sorry if i failed to make myself wholly clear <e> <s> they place the onus on the secretary of state to form an opinion <e> <s> that is what the words add <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that the words did not add anything <e> <s> i was trying to clarify what they added <e>", "<cs> clearly there have been no problems because nobody has been sacked under any of those acts <e> <s> the director general of fair trading has never been sacked <e> <s> the director general of oftel has never been sacked <e> <s> these are very recent events <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble baroness to be more precise <e> <s> does she accept the view put forward as i understand it by the noble lord lord renton that somebody guilty of notorious conduct i think that was the expression <e>", "<cs> notorious misconduct <e> <s> would such a person be guilty of misbehaviour as interpreted and therefore be subject to dismissal <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> if the bill were perfectly clear to me at the outset i should be very happy <e> <s> i am seeking a government view on what they think they are writing into the legislation <e> <s> i am not trying to prolong the debate <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that the noble baroness has listened carefully to our debate this afternoon <e> <s> i also hope that she will read what has been said in <e>", "<cs> i must say that i am again most disappointed in the noble baronesss refusal to accept that we should have a provision at the beginning of the bill to show in very clear terms what the bill is really meant to be about <e> <s> as the noble lord lord peyton said it is meant to be about efficiency and energy conservation <e>", "<cs> i welcome the noble earl lord dundee to the government dispatch box for the first time in the committee <e> <s> however i am afraid i disagree with him on almost every point he made <e> <s> the treasury is not on his side <e> <s> i should like the noble earl to recognise that <e> <s> the job of the treasury is to ensure comparability among various grades in the civil service <e> <s> that is why these measures are made <e>", "<cs> i do not think that we are getting much further but i am grateful to the noble earl for at least passing on our remarks to his right honourable friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> she referred to a net increase <e> <s> what does that mean <e> <s> what is the base line <e>", "<cs> am i right in thinking that all that is pre-privatisation <e> <s> is it right to say that the effect of privatisation in other words the transfer of responsibility from the department of energy to the director which will take place as a result of the bill will lead to a net increase of staff <e> <s> does privatisation therefore equal <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may comment on that point <e> <s> the director general is the accounting officer <e> <s> therefore if he is the accounting officer the accounts are separate from the department which has a separate accounting officer who is the permanent secretary <e> <s> as i understand it that is the position subject to any correction by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> those noble lords who read <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can help the noble baroness <e> <s> the answer is no <e>", "<cs> that may be true <e> <s> the noble baroness asked whether any other consumer organisation welcomed the proposals and the answer is no so far as i know <e>", "<cs> i take the point about councils <e> <s> the noble baroness asked about consumer organisations other than the area councils <e> <s> so far as i know there are no others <e>", "<cs> if that is the reason why the noble lord is speaking then i am perfectly happy to withdraw this amendment if he feels that the object of it is to curry favour with the prime minister <e> <s> we have no desire to do that <e>", "<cs> before we conclude this evenings proceedings i should like to address some remarks to the noble baroness on groupings <e> <s> we had a problem this morning with groupings <e> <s> by am we had not received any suggested groupings from the department <e> <s> it is difficult for the opposition to conduct their affairs if we do not receive the suggested groupings early in the day or as in the case of other departments the night before <e>", "<cs> it is not my lap if i may say so but the government whips office <e> <s> the proof is that the marshalled list was out yesterday at oclock <e>", "<cs> whatever the time was this is the first time i have dealt with the department of energy <e> <s> i have dealt with other departments where there is a clear procedure so that the government whips office has the suggested groupings early in the day <e> <s> it is a question of negotiation between us as to how the amendments are finally grouped <e> <s> other noble lords are also concerned with groupings because they have amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords by what criteria does the minister propose to select the licensees <e>", "<cs> i spoke to this subject in relation to amendment no <e> <s> and i do not wish to weary the committee by repeating the arguments since we spent a long time on the subject <e> <s> i fully support the recommendations of the all-party select committee <e>", "<cs> i hope very much that the noble baroness will consider what the noble lord lord peyton and the noble earl lord lauderdale have said <e> <s> as the noble earl pointed out and we and many noble lords in all parts of the chamber pointed out on the first day of the committee the complexity of running this organisation as it is about to develop is absolutely enormous <e> <s> there is a major question to which we shall come in the next amendment concerning who at the end of the day bears the responsibility <e> <s> we believe that it should be quite clearly the secretary of state who bears the responsibility and the director should be answerable to him <e> <s> we support the remarks made by the noble baronesss noble friends and we hope that she will listen to them carefully <e>", "<cs> i thought i had made it clear that i was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> yes the noble baroness is right <e> <s> it was the object of certain negotiations which took place this morning <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> relates to a somewhat different point <e> <s> nevertheless it eliminates the judgment from the secretary of state by leaving out the words he considers <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may save the time of the committee and the noble lord <e> <s> he is arguing like the distinguished lawyer that he is <e> <s> i am not a draftsman <e> <s> as i said in my introduction i do not wish to press these amendments as amendments to the bill <e> <s> if he likes to take amendment no <e> <s> he will see that the principle is firmly stated <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> with great respect we are having this debate in order to establish why the government believe that the responsibility for security of supply should not rest with the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble earl wishes to say any more but we have had quite a long debate on the subject <e> <s> i would argue that there are two points which are outstanding <e> <s> i am not concerned about whether the secretary of state and the director should be open to judicial review or not <e> <s> i am quite happy that if we leave out he considers that should lay them open to judicial review <e> <s> i think that is perfectly reasonable but i leave that aside <e>", "<cs> i too shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> a and a perhaps i may concentrate on amendments nos <e> <s> a and a which are amendments in my name <e>", "<cs> i believe that we shall have a more substantial debate on amendment no <e> <s> which stands in the name of the noble lord lord renton and so i shall reserve my comments on the environment for that amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble viscount in his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> for <e>", "<cs> i understand that that may be the case in the issuance of the licence <e> <s> however what happens if during the currency of the licence a public electricity supplier engages in one of the little tricks which i have described <e> <s> does the licence then fall or is it revoked <e> <s> what happens under such circumstances <e>", "<cs> with all due respect to the noble baroness i am not talking about insolvency although we could get to that subject <e> <s> i am talking about the position between total financial health and insolvency <e> <s> there is a large grey area there whereby companies may wish to finance themselves or attempt to try to get themselves out of a financial hole by the use of dubious financial techniques which are fairly well known by people who operate in this business <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the minister cannot see the justification for my amendments <e> <s> i believe that the layman although perhaps not the lawyer the noble baroness may be right would say that the duties spelt out in clause are clearly subordinate to the duties spelt out in subsection <e> <s> i shall read carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> she seemed to be implying that the duties were not subordinate but they seem to us to be subordinate <e> <s> if it is necessary we will return to the point at a later stage in the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i intend to speak very briefly because i understand from the weekend press that the noble baroness may be helpful on this matter <e> <s> the weekend press may be wrong but i look forward to her response <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may have clarification from the noble earl <e> <s> does he mean therefore that generating companies are not required to be efficient <e>", "<cs> i am sorry again to intervene <e> <s> however if the noble earl cannot explain what the government amendment is about and wishes to write to my noble friend should not the government withdraw their amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord puts his question in that form because i believe that in some respects they may well be so <e> <s> which company would not look to low cost <e> <s> i tried to copy down the question when the noble lord did not allow me to intervene <e> <s> the answer is probably national power and possibly power gen if i may put that in a direct manner because they are constrained by other provisions in the bill which stop them from doing that <e> <s> they may be constrained by the non-fossil fuel quota for a start and they may well be constrained by other policies relating to coal imports and so on <e> <s> therefore there is no pressure because there is no competitive pressure between the two major power generators <e> <s> whatever the government may argue i simply do not accept that there is competitive pressure <e> <s> in my view they will not be constrained to the lowest cost option <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite wrong <e> <s> given that there are constraints and given that there is no competition it is up to the regulatory

lord <e> <s> i am not a legal expert but a layman <e> <s> however as i read the clause it gives the secretary of state power to direct the grid in a completely different manner which cuts right across

lord <e> <s> i understand that there may be certain applications for the construction of generating stations which should be dealt with otherwise than within the ambit of the clause <e> <s> in that

statute <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i believe that he understands the point i am making as he rightly says it is a point which i have made on many occasions <e> <s> if parliament is to make a statute then that statute must be clear <e> <s> parliament and people outside must understand what it all means and what are the criteria by which the statute will be judged

noble earls explanation <e> <s> it seems that the only person who can make regulations under the paragraphs is the secretary of state <e> <s> that seems to be self-evident <e> <s> can anybody else under the bill as drafted make regulations <e>", "<cs> the noble earl says that the director can make regulations under paragraph of schedule rather than the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i am

body the council for the protection of rural england <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee will be grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> however before the noble lord lord norrie decides what to do with his amendment perhaps she could be a little more precise about which areas she is prepared to look at and accept and which areas she is not prepared to look at and accept <e> <s> it is a

i shall not move the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl taking it away with a view to coming back on report with something more preferable to us <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to the possibility of the consumers committees taking positive action to use his exact words <e> <s> but what positive action has he in mind <e>", "<cs> i should like to reinforce what the noble viscount has said <e> <s> perhaps on this occasion the noble baroness could be generous and consider whether or not this very modest requirement it is quite important but modest should be included in the bill <e>

it that way <e> <s> i speak with a certain amount of personal knowledge because i was the subject of a confidence trick of the kind that the noble baroness has described not perpetrated i am happy to say by an employee of the london electricity board but by an employee of the gas board before it was privatised <e> <s> he gained entry with a view to reading the meter <e> <s> somehow my wife and i were not around and we found certain things missing after he had left <e> <s> i believe that this is something which the government ought to accept <e> <s> the noble baroness has a point and i speak with a strong degree of personal feeling about the matter <e>", "<cs> having supported with great sympathy the amendment tabled by the noble baroness lady blatch i am somewhat unhappy about clause as it stands even as amended <e> <s> it goes much wider than the amendment of the noble baroness <e> <s> the clause states that it is an offence <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i

"<cs> the noble baroness has been kind in giving the committee the benefit of the governments views <e> <s> of course they are exactly as the noble lord lord peyton expressed set in concrete <e> <s> she has disregarded the arguments put forward by the noble earl lord halsbury and the noble lords lord ezra and lord peyton <e> <s> that is apart from saying that the government will introduce an amendment to schedule which will protect the profits of national power <e> <s> protecting the profits of national power was not the objective of my amendment nor i believe that of the noble earls <e>", "<cs> does the noble baroness wish to give her third winding-up speech or shall i give my second <e> <s> i wound up earlier when the noble baroness treated us most courteously to an extensive declaration of government policy <e> <s> since that time there have been many interventions from noble lords opposite <e> <s> i do not question their motives they may or may not be political <e> <s> however part of them were certainly to the point and part if i may say so without mentioning names were wide of the issue which we are discussing here <e> <s> we are discussing the question of whether the nuclear industry should in some form or other remain under public control and what sort of mechanism is needed to achieve that aim <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i accept since he has said so that liabilities here represents legal liabilities which include the accounting definition of contingent liabilities <e> <s> if that is what i have understood him to say i am satisfied so far as that point goes <e> <s> will he then kindly tell me what will happen to electricity council loans that have treasury exchange cover <e> <s> those are loans that are liabilities to the electricity council but have a contingent liability to the treasury <e> <s> will that contingent liability to the treasury equally be passed across or is there some other arrangement for that <e>", "<cs> does the noble earl include in electricity stock foreign currency obligations incurred by the electricity council <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for her response <e> <s> clause refers not only to supply companies but also to the transmission company <e> <s> we do not yet know how the land owned by the cegb will be split between the supply companies and the transmission company that is to say the national grid <e> <s> large tracts of snowdonia are owned by the central electricity generating board but they are used not for putting up supply installations such as nuclear power stations other than trawsfynydd which we shall ignore for the purposes of this argument but are used by the national grid for putting down supply lines which in fact disfigure the landscape <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> after the group registration of the electricity council for vat purposes lapsed on st april what will be the treatment of the balance as at st april which of course continues because the value added tax is difficult to compute and indeed difficult to collect <e> <s> what will happen to that on vesting <e>", "<cs> can the noble earl say since the electricity council will cease to exist who will take up the liability of that council <e>", "<cs> i am rather surprised at that answer because

interpretation of accounting procedures <e> <s> as i understand it he says that in some ways what is being set up as the statutory reserve is the equivalent to a share premium account <e> <s> in some ways is a rather curious expression <e> <s> i accept that a share premium account is a non-distributable reserve and can only be used for a bonus issue on a fully paid share <e> <s> nevertheless i still have to come back to the noble lord and ask have the accumulated realised profits of the transferor been calculated at this time on the point of transfer by reference to generally accepted accounting principles <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> they do not meet with my approval but that is neither here nor there <e> <s> i simply wish to establish what the basis of the statutory reserve will be <e> <s> the noble lord said in some ways it will resemble a share premium account in a private company <e> <s> the share premium account in a private company is established according to generally accepted accounting principles <e> <s> the noble lord has said that generally accepted accounting principles have not applied in the past <e> <s> therefore it will be up to the secretary of state to decide what will be in the account <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> however i should have thought that by this stage of the bill and at this point in the committee stage the government would have responses to these points <e> <s> after all the bill has been around for quite a long time <e> <s> we need to know how the finances of successor companies will be constituted <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for his offer to write to me but i shall reserve my position and i may well come back on report with further amendments should that be

moment contained in the companies bill that political contributions should be subject to shareholder resolution will form part of the companies act and if the successor companies wish to follow that

one cannot have is something which is immediately before and something which is immediately after the year end <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> however i emphasise that at the year end is a recognised accounting principle <e> <s> immediately before the year end is not a recognised accounting principle <e> <s> if the noble lord could look at the drafting again i should be grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i was referring to material post-balance sheet events <e> <s> he is now talking about all material events subsequent to the year end <e> <s> so we must assume that the opening accounts after vesting will reflect profit and loss material variations that there will be a clawback on the previous years accounts when a prospectus comes out as it will do and that all material events will be built into the new company accounts as at the opening date of st april <e> <s> if that is what i understand the noble lord to say he appears to be nodding and saying yes that is the way it will be i am grateful to hear it <e> <s> my next amendment will serve to clarify exactly what material

companies <e> <s> if it does not mean that i do not understand english <e> <s> i understand from the noble lord that that is what he says <e> <s> that is quite different from saying that revaluation must be done <e>", "<cs> again i appreciate that the noble lord is correcting himself slightly but as i understood him and i am sorry to repeat my words he said that there should be no discontinuity between the accounts of the transferor companies and the successor companies <e> <s> we are at one on that <e> <s> therefore the revaluation of the assets at the point of vesting is not what the noble

electricity council in passing on i hope i may use that expression records and documents to successor companies or indeed boards or the secretary of state will not reveal any commercially confidential information that the disappearing bodies may have had <e> <s> that has been a problem in the past <e> <s> commercially confidential information which may be the property of the electricity council which is to disappear could be passed on to those under the privatised scheme who could make use of that information <e>", "<cs> but how are we to be sure that there is no violation of confidential information of a commercial nature in the transfer <e> <s> it is normally the case that commercial confidentiality is protected in such transfers <e> <s> however i see nothing in the bill at the

great importance for companies and indeed for individuals <e> <s> whatever the noble earl says from the government dispatch box i am afraid has no authority in a court of law <e> <s> unless a provision to cover this situation is written into the bill in some form or another a court in the course of time this may not happen may discover that there has been a revelation or use of some information that has been classified as commercially confidential by one of the bodies which are to disappear <e> <s> if that information is used in the course of time a court would have regard to the bill rather than to the assurance that the noble earl has given me <e> <s> the government would do well to have a look at this matter and see whether or not a provision should be written on to the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl saying that the obligation of confidence will be transferred to the successor companies which by then will be privatised <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> she has extended the point that i made quite rightly <e> <s> to refer to the experience of the noble baroness it could be that the electricity council has information about area boards present customers which is extremely sensitive <e> <s> it may be that the area board plc if i may use that expression will respect the commercial confidentiality of such information <e> <s> it may be that it will not <e> <s> i should like to pursue the matter a little further to see whether the noble earl is prepared to give me and the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes an assurance that the government will think again about the matter <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the revelation that there will be a central services organisation <e> <s> it is the first time that i have heard of such an organisation which is to hold documents which are commercially confidential <e> <s> will the noble earl elaborate on the functions of the central services organisation <e> <s> how long will it last <e> <s> who will be in charge <e> <s> who will staff it <e> <s> what are its rules <e> <s> will it be a public body or a semi-public body <e> <s> can we have more information on

he will send a copy of his letter to the noble baroness lady gardner and perhaps to other members of the committee who will be interested in the point <e> <s> in his letter would he like to set out the functions of this central services organisation who will be appointed whether they are to be paid and whether there will be a new schedule to the bill saying that this that and thus will happen

<e> <s> is there any reference in the bill as drafted to the cso as he now calls it <e>", "<cs> the cso will take over a number of responsibilities from statutory bodies <e> <s> therefore it is quite proper that there should be in the bill a transfer arrangement as there is for rather larger enterprises to this important organisation <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will bear in mind what i and the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes have said and consider whether this organisation should be part of the statute in some form or another <e> <s> in my view it would be appropriate for there to be a schedule which would outline the functions which the noble earl has put before us at a rather curious stage five-past one on a friday afternoon on the sixth day of committee <e>", "<cs> it may have been well publicised but it has escaped my attention and the attention of my noble friends <e> <s> nevertheless i do not want to prolong the discussion <e> <s> however i make the very serious point that if there is to be a public organisation the cso which will receive certain very important information which is commercially confidential and confidential in other respects and which will have the responsibilities that the noble earl described it seems to me that there should be a schedule to the bill to describe exactly what the organisation is to do <e> <s> i leave that thought with the noble earl <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> again i am grateful to the noble earl but i do not find his reply entirely satisfactory <e> <s> there are many public bodies on which people are called to serve and do serve not because they are remunerated but because they wish to give public service <e> <s> when one company is taken over by another company it is perfectly reasonable for the chairman to be sacked and given some kind of a golden handshake although the extent of golden handshakes now beggars the imagination <e> <s> however it seems odd that the taxpayer who indirectly through the government and the consolidated fund will receive enormous sums from privatisation should remunerate people for loss of office just because they will not be transferred to successor companies <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble earl can help me on further points <e> <s> the word he used was full-time <e> <s> which members of which boards make their full-time living from membership of those boards rather than seeing it as a part-time occupation like that of a non-executive director of a public company <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble earl will explain to me because i am genuinely ignorant on the matter whether those full-time members are executive or non-executive members <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> if there are some full-time non-executive members of the board what on earth are they doing <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may come back very briefly on that point <e> <s> i do indeed distinguish between jobs that are done at the invitation of government which generally speaking are public service jobs and jobs for which people are elected by a group of shareholders to be directors of a public company <e> <s> i do distinguish between them <e> <s> the noble earl may not make that distinction but i do <e>", "<cs> i do not think that we can get much further in this debate <e> <s> i do not like the idea that the secretary of state should have total discretion to remunerate non-executive members of boards who apparently spend all their time on non-executive duties for reasons which i do not understand <e> <s> they may be extremely worthy ladies or gentlemen <e> <s> i find that position very odd <e> <s> my experience is that once the secretary of state is given powers to do something in particular to pay out taxpayers money he will normally pay out the taxpayers money because that is the easy way out <e>", "<cs> i am as always grateful to the noble baroness for her explanations <e> <s> however i do not think this one meets the point <e> <s> we have established in an earlier part of the bill i refer the committee to clause that subject to the provisions of clause <e>", "<cs> we have moved a little further <e> <s> we now know that while the bill is before noble lords we shall not have any idea of what the capital structure of the successor companies will be <e> <s> we also know as a consequence that we have no idea of how the successor companies balance sheets will look what debt they will be loaded with or not loaded with as the case may be <e> <s> this is different from the british gas situation <e> <s> the noble earl lord russell and i were veterans of the passage of the gas bill through this chamber and we spent quite a lot of time discussing the nature and extent of the debentures that the government would impose on british gas so that they could sell those debentures off to the market and receive the appropriate cash into the consolidated fund <e> <s> in this case we have no <e>", "<cs> i understand <e> <s> i do not wish to chide the noble baroness for being unspecific and unclear <e> <s> she has been perfectly specific and perfectly clear <e> <s> what she has said in very simple words is that she will not let the committee or indeed your lordships house have any idea of what the capital structure of the successor companies will be before the bill leaves this place that is perfectly specific and perfectly clear <e> <s> she has made the point and no doubt we shall have to return to that at later stages <e> <s> if she can be more specific and more helpful at a later stage we shall be most grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am as always grateful to the noble baroness for her courteous explanation of what the government have in mind but i still do not have a definition of what parts of trades means <e> <s> i can understand that the cegb carries on a trade <e> <s> it may carry on a number of trades <e> <s> it may carry on the trade of generating or transmitting or trades of which we know not <e> <s> the inland revenue makes a clear distinction between one trade and another and it has some perfectly clear ideas or reasonably clear ideas though they are subject to dispute from time to time on whether trade a is the same as trade b what i have never seen in any tax legislation is the phrase parts of trades <e>", "<cs> quite obviously i have not explained myself clearly to the noble baroness <e> <s> from the point of view of the inland revenue the cegb may carry on several trades or it may carry on one <e> <s> i suspect that in splitting up the inland revenue will decide that there are several trades <e> <s> i put myself in the position of the inland revenue and say that there is the trade of generating there is the trade of transmitting and there is probably the trade of selling electricity to industrial customers direct from the generating facility <e> <s> these are trades and not parts of them <e> <s> i have a certain experience of tax law <e> <s> these reconstructions are very complicated in tax terms both in the private and public sector <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> the income and corporation taxes act does not refer to or parts of trades <e> <s> if the government are now going to write into the bill those words then they will have to write them into the income and corporation taxes act <e> <s> the treasury may feel that that is perhaps not the right thing to do <e> <s> i am trying to help the government over this matter so that they do not open up a tremendous railway channel through which we can run when we are considering the reconstruction of private companies <e> <s> it is in a spirit of total co-operation with the government that i make these observations <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble baroness wishes to add anything to what i have said <e>", "<cs> it gives me great encouragement for my future professional activities <e> <s> if the words or parts of trades are admitted into this bill then we shall have to admit the same into the income and corporation taxes act <e> <s> that will give great comfort to all kinds of people who are my friends <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble baroness might wish to reconsider this point <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> why does the noble earl believe this to be a very important amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> sub-paragraph to which we shall return in later amendments defines unallowed tax losses but the tax losses which will be transferred or apportioned under sub-paragraph seem in theory to lie outside the unallowed tax losses which are defined in sub-paragraph <e> <s> in other words there are tax losses which are putative tax losses which i think is what the noble baroness was saying <e> <s> they may have been not allowed because they have not been taken against profits but are putatively taken against profits <e>", "<cs> i accept the fact that perhaps there should have been a consequential amendment or that i should have moved an amendment as regards paragraph c which would have been consistent with the amendment i now move <e> <s> however i do not think that i have quite managed to get my point across to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s>

difficulty in reconciling the closing accounts of the previous or existing bodies with the opening accounts of the successor bodies <e> <s> the opening accounts of the successor bodies will be at

approval of the director but the committee may say that any sub-committee can go off and do whatever it wants <e> <s> that would be perfectly within the ambit of the schedule as drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i understand that the government feel very attached to medieval tradition and therefore do not wish to change <e> <s> in the light of the noble lords explanation that he insists on that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he say what sort of modifications the director might consider appropriate <e> <s> is he going to cook the figures <e> <s> what will happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i still do not have a proper answer if i may say so in the kindest possible way to what is the entitlement of the director to modify a financial statement provided by a responsible consumer committee <e> <s> it has worked on has decided to pass and will have forwarded the statement to the director <e> <s> the director can approve it or not approve it on the grounds mentioned by the noble lord <e> <s> but what sort of modifications can he introduce <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to continue the argument <e> <s> as the noble lord says in reality there would be a discussion between the director and the consumer committee <e> <s> however that is not what the schedule says <e> <s> it says that the director can approve the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and green baroness for her undertaking and of course i shall shortly beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however i cannot help reflecting on the governments and the noble baronesss view that they are being pushed pushed and pushed again and they have always had to concede to pressure <e> <s> i thought that the government were in favour of all those matters and to have to be pushed by the opposition and by the noble lord lord norrie seems to be beating a rather curious and ragged retreat <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness but she said that the subsections are complementary <e> <s> however what happens if they are in conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble baroness yet again <e> <s> however i shall not do so too often <e> <s> the argument here is about clause c which lays on the secretary of state and the director each of them a duty <e>", "<cs> my lords if my concerns are unfounded why does section of the gas act give competition and public safety equal emphasis <e> <s> why should we not in this legislation give consumer protection and competition equal emphasis <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a short debate on this rather important subject and i do not wish to pursue the matter at this stage <e> <s> however i do not believe that there will be competition in the electricity supply industry and i do not believe that there will be competition in the supply of electricity to domestic consumers <e>

rank <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first ask the noble lord lord ezra whether we are discussing his amendment no <e> <s> in this group <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the noble lord lord ezra about amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> it is the amendment tabled by the noble viscount lord hanworth <e> <s> we are speaking to a grouping which consists of government amendment no <e>

nevertheless they have to be made <e> <s> one cannot simply shrug them off and say they do not have to be made <e> <s> so there must be some clear estimate <e> <s> indeed the electricity council has in the past made estimates which as it turned out were way above the total level of demand for electricity <e> <s> therefore we should like to see some rather more sophisticated statistical mechanism which must exist in order to ensure that demand is not overestimated <e>", "<cs> my lords the phrase from time to time could mean every five years <e>", "<cs> my lords what is regular <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down obviously it does not make a great deal of difference <e> <s> if the information is collected from time to time it could be wildly out of date when the director makes his regular report <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble earl will look carefully at what has been said in this discussion <e> <s> it seems to me odd that the director should from time to time collect information which he shall then publish regularly <e> <s> he can from time to time collect information and by the time he regularly publishes it it may be wildly out of date <e>", "<cs>

operate <e> <s> if the director is to report regularly he has to collect information regularly otherwise he will have out-of-date information on which he is reporting <e> <s> however in the light of

statements do not have to be filed and i understand that nevertheless they will be sent out to many thousands of shareholders <e> <s> again those shareholders may fail to opt for the full report and

the provision work <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only two relatively small points apart from welcoming the noble and learned lord the lord advocate to our discussions on commons amendments <e> <s> the

can be pledged unknowingly in margin for contract <e> <s> the other people will therefore and thereby be deprived if the margin is called <e> <s> the sums involved could be million million or million <e> <s> it seems to me to be wrong that if someone owns property beneficially and finds his property pledged in margin for a contract if that contract were called he could lose his money without knowing about it at all <e> <s> it is a very odd situation <e> <s> it is up to the recipient of the cover for margin to satisfy himself that the property provided is in the beneficial ownership of the provider <e> <s> that must be a very basic principle whatever the sums involved <e> <s> i recognise what the noble lord said about the market and how important it is <e> <s> however i still believe that it is a fundamental principle of law that somebodys money cannot be pledged on the margin of contracts or anything else without his agreement <e> <s> unfortunately that is what the government have written in <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble lord will wish to speak further to that point when he moves his amendment if i withdraw my amendment <e> <s> in that hope i beg leave to withdraw

with such <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> the reasons for this amendment are to introduce a relatively small delay in introducing part i briefly the reasons are first

have not prepared their figures under the new rules <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the pressure of time that the directive places upon us <e> <s> nevertheless i am sure that this will create

grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> my advice comes from the institute of chartered accountants <e> <s> if it has not made representations and nor have any of the major accountants it is their fault

consolidated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord has indicated the governments debt to my honourable friend in another place <e> <s> the point that he made was one that i raised at the same time <e> <s> as the minister will know because we had a number of exchanges on the matter in committee and on report merger accounting has been a matter of consistent trouble <e> <s> we are not

should not be introduced to deal with an urgent matter <e> <s> in order <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord prepared to report this exchange to his right honourable friend to make sure that my

barriers <e> <s> there are stories of accidents occurring and people being squashed <e> <s> do the government have any figures on that and if so what are they <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press

minister tell the house which view the ministry of defence will express to the director general of fair trading via the merger panel <e> <s> as he is aware and has said the director general of fair trading has to make a recommendation to the secretary of state for trade and industry <e> <s> the minister will be aware that the secretary of state is advised by the merger panel upon which the

be a monopoly situation <e> <s> will it give the advice in respect of the gec takeover of plessey in where it advised that it did not matter whether it was a monopoly situation <e> <s> which of the two positions will the minister take <e>", "<cs> my lords in his answer the noble lord mentioned normal tax law <e> <s> is he aware that sir peter gregson gave evidence to the public accounts committee in another place that the arrangement was that the company should have the opportunity to submit to the inland revenue its proposals for reorganising its affairs <e> <s> the arrangement was that before implementing them the company should obtain clearance from the inland revenue under section of the income and corporation taxes act <e> <s> under what law or what provision of that act or what body of any law is such clearance available <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord draw my attention to any company in the past years that has received clearance from the revenue under that section <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not therefore the case that the dti was first advising the company badly and secondly prepared to go in for almost any tax fiddle that would get rid of rover <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord think carefully about what he has just said that british aerospace was the only company interested in buying rover <e> <s> is it not the case that there were other candidates and that the government gave exclusivity to british aerospace <e> <s> therefore by definition it was the only company available to bid <e>", "<cs> my lords how on earth can somebody make a bid when exclusivity has been given to somebody else <e>", "<cs> my lords we congratulate the government on taking action on this matter at long last <e> <s> they could have done so five years ago <e> <s> will the minister be good enough to join the noble lord lord tordoff in congratulating my noble friend lord mason on bringing the matter to the attention of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble

government <e> <s> there is no medium term financial strategy despite what they say <e> <s> will the noble lord come clean and admit that that is the governments position <e>", "<cs> my lords has the

does he accept and i hope that he does as it is a matter of statistical fact that as he said our manufacturing productivity has gone up very greatly but total economy productivity has not progressed

all prepared <e> <s> we were prepared for a philosophical debate about the free market whatever that may mean and i shall come to that point in a minute and the consequences thereof <e> <s> i hope

may intervene again what i said was that monopolies whether private or public should be properly controlled <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the premise of the noble lords question and his supplementary question as well as the ministers answer is correct <e> <s> one grants that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord described the measures that the government are taking to introduce energy efficient lamps into the palace <e> <s> on a slightly wider scale can he tell the house whether the government have an electricity efficiency programme throughout all the buildings that they

clear that although i speak from the dispatch box i am not representing the labour partys position on the bill because it is a private members bill <e> <s> i am therefore speaking in my personal

statements on electricity privatisation emerging from the department of energy this statement raises a further host of questions and does not take us a great deal further <e> <s> i shall try to marshal my questions for the benefit of your lordships because there are many under several headings <e> <s> i start first with the price increases that the secretary of state envisages <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the government declared their intention early in april they commissioned a report from coopers lybrand on the whole privatisation programme of the btg they received the report in july and they have done nothing since then <e> <s> is it not the case that any company management which has the sword of damocles of privatisation hanging over it cannot work properly <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount reject the assertion by the noble lord lord orr-ewing that the management of btg which has been in the public sector since the noble earl lord halsbury was managing director has become fuddy-duddy <e> <s> it has been extremely successful and there is no reason why a public sector company cannot recruit proper management at the right price <e>", "<cs> my

secretary of state for energy needs serious public relations advice on privatisation <e> <s> we take that for granted <e> <s> however can the noble viscount answer my noble friends question <e> <s> how much money is the taxpayer because this is the taxpayer and not the electricity industry going to have to pay for public relations advice to be given to mr john wakeham <e>", "<cs> my lords what is commercially confidential about the amount of money the taxpayer will pay for this <e>", "<cs> my lords since the government are in fact subsidising company cars i am sure the noble viscount recognises that there are considerable benefits to an individual who has a company car would it not be appropriate for the government to take up the point made by his noble friend lord renton that such cars should only be subsidised if they have a large uk component in them <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of intruding unnecessarily into the learned discussion perhaps i may say that if the expression know-how is to be included in a capital allowances bill it should also include registered designs and the new design right created by the copyright designs and patents act <e> <s> i suspect that that extension of the law would be outside the remit of a consolidation bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this morning thames water announced an increase of per cent <e> <s> in its prices <e> <s> is this the pattern of things to come from the privatised water authority <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind that i did not ask him why <e> <s> i asked whether that is the pattern of things to come <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble viscount for introducing the order which is a matter of substance and importance <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to address many noble lords on the opposite benches and make my points with my customary trenchancy <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall not continue to interrupt the noble viscount but i wish to point out that that is not relevant to the present order <e> <s> the order denies access by an individual to the computer records with which we are dealing <e> <s> it is not a question of whether the secretary of state may or may not pass information to an overseas regulatory authority <e> <s> that is a different question <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening again <e> <s> i understand about statements of principle and codes of practice under the amendments to the financial services act which were passed in the companies act <e> <s> i spent a lot of time studying and debating them <e> <s> i simply do not see and the noble viscount has not answered my question why there should be exemption under section of the data protection act in order to allow the sib to discharge the function of making statements of principle in codes of practice <e> <s> i very much hope that the noble viscount will be able to answer my question <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am sorry to interrupt <e> <s> i do not regard my question as detailed <e> <s> it is a question about the principle of part ii of the schedule <e> <s> why are the government coming forward with this order at this point in time when they cannot answer the simplest questions from the opposition front bench <e> <s> if the noble viscount says that he would like further time to consider this matter then i suggest that he withdraws the order and we start all over again <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be interested in the news that the noble lord has given us about the possibility of the stock exchange mounting prosecutions <e> <s> does he recognise however that from anecdotal evidence and i agree that the evidence is difficult to prove in a court of law insider dealing is believed to be widespread <e> <s> wherever there is a merger or takeover or a proposed merger or takeover strange movements in shares frequently seem to occur <e> <s> are the government serious about their ambitions to stamp out this iniquitous offence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that response <e> <s> i wonder whether i could press the noble lord a little further <e> <s> there has been a great deal of discussion about whether the securities and investments board should be given the responsibility for investigating and prosecuting these offences <e> <s> what is the governments position on that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can help the noble lord on the matter of stock exchange prosecutions <e> <s> is it not the case that those prosecutions must be criminal prosecutions <e> <s> there is no such thing as a civil prosecution in that area <e> <s> if the stock exchange is to bring to bear powers under legislation it must bring to bear powers of criminal prosecution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for what i suppose is his reply to the debate <e> <s> i am most grateful also to the noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> until the ministerial intervention it had been an extremely interesting debate <e> <s> there was a great deal of common ground between both sides of the house on the diagnosis although there were political differences about the prescription for the cure <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the minister that we must obtain the maximum amount of co-operation in these cases <e> <s> however following on from the question of my noble friend will the minister confirm that the sub-aqua divers association is the main obstacle to declaring a marine reserve in cardigan bay <e> <s> that position has lasted for some time and the association has declared itself opposed to marine reserves in principle and therefore will never agree to any such reserves <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount has been quite explicit in telling us why this is an enabling bill rather than a bill to explain to parliament how much money the taxpayer is expected to pay in order to meet the accumulated deficit of the coal industry <e> <s> it would have been perfectly possible for the government to have put in clause that the obligation on the secretary of state was subject to approval from the coal and steel community <e> <s> we would all have understood that <e> <s> he has explained that and we certainly would welcome it appearing specifically on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> we are trying to provide that subject to a proper review of the accounts and any accumulated group deficit at the end of march which is not far away the secretary of state shall have an obligation <e> <s> the review is objective and is designed to establish the balance sheet position at the end of march by normal accounting procedures <e> <s> under those circumstances and to be absolutely frank the treasury will have little option but to agree to the secretary of states decision <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to take issue with the noble viscount <e> <s> at the end of march a balance sheet must be struck containing figures which are precise <e> <s> i do not wish to speak about the next amendment but the amounts must be struck by the end of march <e> <s> that is what the bill provides <e> <s> if that is the case how can the amounts be imprecise <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble viscount a question about future liabilities to which he referred <e> <s> it is clear from the corporations statement of accounting policies that the charge which the corporation has admitted in its profit and loss in respect of noise induced hearing loss is made on a systematic basis <e> <s> those accounting policies in the annual report state that that is calculated over the average service lives of the employees concerned having regard to the current experience in the submission and the cost of settlement of claims <e>", "<cs> it certainly could so provide if it was felt that this was a continuing measure which should be included in any balance sheet <e> <s> for example if a nuclear power station and i revert to a subject which the noble viscount and i have discussed knows that it has certain shutdown or decommissioning costs then it is perfectly proper although it is well in the future for the company concerned to make some kind of provision <e> <s> it will not necessarily be done on the balance sheet because i agree that those are provisions which are known at the time <e> <s> however it can be done through contingent liabilities in respect of employees who may be there but nevertheless are not liable to claim at that point in time <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount continues perhaps i may make it absolutely clear that this is a probing amendment <e> <s> i am not asking the noble viscount to explain what the effect of the amendment if carried would be <e> <s> i am using it as a vehicle to probe the governments view on what valuations they will put on the corporations assets <e>", "<cs> i do not find that to be an answer at all <e> <s> i do not wish to be discourteous to the noble viscount but i wish he would address the problems i raised <e> <s> first the question of write-down implies that there is some convention which requires the corporation to write down its assets if they are assumed to have suffered a permanent diminution in value i am quoting from the accounting policies which can be changed unless investment has been undertaken to make sure that those assets perform better than they have in the past <e>", "<cs> the discussion between us is now on three points <e> <s> the first relates to non-operating assets which might be surplus to operational requirements <e> <s> we are still not satisfied that the government have instructed the corporation to itemise those assets and to value them at full present market value in establishing the accumulated group deficit <e>", "<cs> i do not think we are going to get very much further with this argument <e> <s> i still believe that the government should set some definition for the corporation as to what permanent really means <e> <s> i ask the government to please talk to the chairmen of the major oil companies to ascertain their views on what the price of oil will be in <e> <s> the government will then be able to see whether there is a permanent diminution in the value of the colleries <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble viscount <e> <s> i understand that it is not the governments intention to eliminate the whole financing deficit of the corporation but the accumulated group deficit in other words past losses <e> <s> i can find all kinds of accounting procedures for ensuring that forgiveness of debt does not appear as a credit on the accumulated group deficit <e> <s> if the noble viscount wants my advice i am happy to give it to him obviously for a commercial fee <e> <s> i can certainly find ways and means of doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care to explain to his noble friend lord lauderdale that our opposition to privatisation is much more consistent than his <e> <s> we have constantly voted against the governments measures for privatisation whereas the noble earl has not done so <e> <s> given that the secretary of state for energy has advisers in respect of the privatisation of the electricity industry in england and wales including one personal public relations adviser paid by the taxpayer can the minister say how many advisers the secretary of state for scotland has and does he also have a personal public relations adviser <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give the house an assurance that the bringing into force of sunday collections throughout the country will not affect the service from monday to saturday <e> <s> is he aware of the suspicion that sunday collections will simply reduce the resources available for proper deliveries on monday to saturday <e> <s> the union of communication workers is worried about the matter <e> <s> we look forward to an assurance from the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount take this opportunity of clarifying government policy on the pwrs <e> <s> is he aware that we had a statement from the noble lord the leader of the house saying in effect that the government were to continue with sizewell b and not continue with hinkley point c wylfa b and sizewell c <e> <s> that was the statement as we understood it <e> <s> yet is he not aware that the hinkley point inquiry into hinkley point c is still continuing at great expenditure of public money <e> <s> do or do not the government intend to continue with hinkley point c <e>", "<cs> my lords if nuclear electric is not to build any more pwrs why does it persist in making an application under the terms of the public inquiry on hinkley point c <e>", "<cs> my lords has there been correspondence between her majestys government and the commission about the matter since we last discussed it in this house <e> <s> if so will the government please publish the correspondence <e>", "<cs> my lords can we have an assurance from the minister that when the government receive the commissions judgment he will come to this house and make a full and frank statement about it and that this time it should be the truth <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to my noble friend lady ewart-biggs for introducing this debate and bringing the work of the cabs to our attention <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for repeating the statement made by the secretary of state for trade and industry in another place <e> <s> the statement is fairly extraordinary but it raises any number of questions of which i shall only be able to put a few <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord also confirm that the trade union of communication workers arrived at an agreement with the post office for the improvement of service throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the european fast reactor be based entirely on french technology or will the experience of dounreay be used <e> <s> will the noble viscount tell us whether the costings of the fast reactor will be accurate this time so that we do not have the surprises with regard to decommissioning and other costs that led us to conclude that nuclear power in general is uneconomical <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of being branded an accountant and wishing to establish the true cost of energy perhaps i may ask the noble viscount whether the government have any plans or negotiations with experts in the field to achieve standardised assessment of costs between different forms of renewable energy and normal fossil-generated electricity <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount grasp the point <e> <s> the investment being made which he quite rightly mentions is being made by british rail out of british rail cash-flow <e> <s> it has nothing to do with government subsidy <e> <s> will he accept that there is no other capital city in western europe which has a commuter service with the characteristics to which his noble friend lord aldington quite rightly referred and which operates without extensive public subsidy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl said that interest rates were reviewed on a day-to-day basis <e> <s> can he tell us what is the governments view today as opposed to that of yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount <e> <s> how many business failures

<s> the government must have a view on what will happen in response to his noble friends question <e> <s> what is that view <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness with her noble and learned friend recognise that very few supplementaries have come from the benches opposite <e> <s> does that imply that conservatives are not prepared to engage in these debates <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his answer so far as it goes <e> <s> does he not agree that it is profoundly unsatisfactory that a major british public company may have to return large sums of money to the government and that there are allegations flying around that parliament was misled and that there was government subterfuge <e> <s> does the minister further agree that none of these matters can be resolved until the commission pronounces <e> <s> can he confirm that the government will do everything in their power to hasten that decision and make sure that we can debate these matters in the open light of full knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to detain your lordships for long because we have had some lengthy interventions on the bill and it has been debated at considerable length in another place <e> <s> the house is certainly grateful to the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene <e> <s> not all bills produced by the government in this session were adumbrated in the gracious speech <e> <s> it is perfectly possible for the government to bring forward bills that were not adumbrated in the gracious speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble viscount on that point <e> <s> my problem is related to the definition <e> <s> there are times when parliament can rely on secondary legislation to extend definitions although the criminal procedure is enshrined in primary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl respond precisely to the question put by his noble friend lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> how many countries use credit controls in the fight against inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to my noble friend lady ewart-biggs for introducing the bill <e> <s> as a number of noble lords have said it raises a very important issue and i shall come to that basic issue in a few moments <e> <s> however thanks to the intervention of the noble baroness lady oppenheim-barnes we have had a full history as to how the original bill came about <e> <s> that was due to the efforts of herself and the national consumer council to meet certain problems which are certainly extremely important <e> <s> that is the first point that i wish to make <e> <s> we have a major problem in respect of consumers and their rights because there is no genuinely enforceable guarantee <e> <s> that is the first problem which must be dealt with in some form or another <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down can he help me on one point <e> <s> he said that the government were favourably disposed in principle to consumer guarantees but that the dti was conducting its own inquiry into the facts <e> <s> does he not recognise first that the national consumer council conducted a very detailed inquiry into the facts and that they are already established <e> <s> secondly in order to assist our future deliberations can the noble viscount tell the house how long the dti inquiry will take <e> <s> will it be another years before it does anything <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount recall that when we last discussed this matter at question time on th january i asked certain questions about return on capital employed <e> <s> if the thorp installation is to be two-thirds dependent on foreign contracts which will certainly be less favourable in financial terms than domestic contracts what will be the return on capital employed <e> <s> if that capital is costed at the present base rate of per cent <e> <s> will the whole thing be in profit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the noble viscount but his answer like his letter does not take us much further <e> <s> can he kindly give an estimated return on capital employed for the thorp installation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount saying that an investment of billion is being undertaken without any estimate of what the return will be <e>", "<cs> my lords if sizewell bs first four years are contracted out at a fixed price as i understood the noble viscount to say on that price will sizewell b on the capital costs now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the noble viscount <e> <s> i am sure that he is aware that the rate of return will be calculated on the capital cost of the project <e> <s> if the capital cost goes up on a fixed price does that not mean that the rate of return comes down <e> <s> at what point does the rate of return become negative <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord taken on board the fact that the interest rate policy which he just described hits specific sectors and geographical areas <e> <s> that policy does not hit across the economic spectrum witness the appalling trade figures we have seen today <e> <s> will the government now review their counter-inflation policy seeking not just to influence sectors such as the building industry in specific areas but seeking to get demand back across the whole economy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept my suggestion that the counter-inflation policy of the government is wholly ineffective <e> <s> it has no effect at the moment on the core rate of inflation <e> <s> it has no effect on the trade balance <e> <s> is it not about time that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter woke up to the fact that a different and stronger policy is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say whether the governments commitment to join is on a narrow band basis or on a broad band basis <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead for introducing his motion <e> <s> it is an opportune motion at an opportune time as many noble lords have said <e> <s> it has also given us the opportunity to hear from a number of distinguished former members of the commission not least my noble friend lord richard who made an eloquent and distinguished maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure that we shall hear much more from him in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give the house some information about the person who escaped and who we understand was responsible for some of the worst rioting at strangeways during the disturbances <e> <s> under what circumstances did he escape and what is the news about his possible recapture <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble earl imply that some of the increases which chairmen and directors of public companies have awarded themselves are unearned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he will have plenty of opportunity to make his point when he comes to speak as his name is on the list of speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> nowhere in my speech did i make any criticism of officials <e> <s> my comments were directed to ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness kindly give us a record of the actions of the last liberal government <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that all ministerial speeches on this matter have now to be cleared through no <e> <s> <e> <s> was this speech cleared through no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord very kindly explain how it is that a cabinet minister can speak personally <e>", "<cs> my lords was the noble lords right honourable friend the foreign secretary also speaking personally <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may address this question to the noble lord the leader of the house <e> <s> does he as a cabinet minister himself support the view of the noble lord lord trefgarne on ministerial responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that a code of practice operates among banks so that they cannot pass on information gained through the banking system for the purposes of promoting other services without the permission of the person to whom the mail is to be sent <e> <s> is there not a case for extending that code of practice to others who participate in the business so that anybody who is liable to receive direct mail may be asked before they receive it whether or not they wish to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords before we finish this question can the noble lord look again at his statement that he is satisfied with the present arrangements <e> <s> is he not aware that many people are vexatiously bothered by this mail <e> <s> is he not further aware that it is very difficult to get your name removed from the list because of misspellings misdirections and many other matters <e> <s> can the noble lord look again at this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not being a little cavalier in his response to the question even a little frivolous <e> <s> was not the meeting one that other member states of the community considered important <e> <s> does the secretary of state who has many burdens indeed some of them may appear next week have a rating which he uses to judge whether or not a particular meeting is important <e> <s> how do ministers decide other than on a purely rhetorical basis <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i am sorry that the government feel unable to accept the consumer guarantee because i was led to believe that in another place they looked with some favour upon such a guarantee <e> <s> nevertheless if that is their position they will have to demonstrate it <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to the noble lord lord mottistone i must say that i do not see why a private members bill entitled consumer guarantees bill should not have a consumer guarantee within it <e> <s> if the government decide to sabotage the bill that is a matter for them <e> <s> it is not for members of this chamber or of another place <e> <s> it is for the government to say that they will not let it through <e> <s> the noble viscount has been quite clear on the matter <e> <s> he said that the government will oppose it <e> <s> that is the governments problem it is not a problem for this chamber <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to detain the committee for long but i wish to put on the record that the committee has put back a consumer guarantee into the consumer guarantees bill <e> <s> i hope that when we have completed the remaining stages of this bill it will leave the chamber with the consumer guarantee still in it <e> <s> it is now up to the government to decide as the noble viscount lord ullswater quite rightly said what they will do about the bill in another place if it leaves this chamber with a consumer guarantee in it <e> <s> i say to the noble viscount and to the government in the clearest possible terms that if they do not make time for this bill in another place they will be in contempt of both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> is there still a cegb <e>", "<cs> has the minister anything to say in reply to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> the minister has not given a very satisfactory reply to this amendment <e> <s> he said that he could not give me any assurance that he would be as positive as i wanted <e> <s> he has been more or less negative <e> <s> he could not give me an assurance that his department understood that privatisation had started and that there was no longer a cegb <e> <s> he called it a departmental colloquialism <e> <s> the minister then referred to water privatisation and he said that no complaints had been received in that connection <e> <s> i do not understand how water privatisation comes into the context of my amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not trying to argue that the government should be committed to a single policy <e> <s> i am trying to argue that the government should be committed to a policy <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> will the minister tell us from where he gets his information about labour party policy <e>", "<cs> does the minister always believe what he

indicating that the delivery structure of the post office is under serious review <e> <s> is it the case that the post office intends to cut out <e>", "<cs> my lords does the leader of the house recognise that with the privatisations that have taken place there is a somewhat different dimension for ministers and their future careers outside government <e> <s> ministers are responsible for privatisations <e> <s> privatisations are completed by government and ministers are responsible for their departments <e> <s> is it not therefore rather odd that there are no rules governing the future careers of ministers who are actually in charge of the privatisation of the companies which they then join <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be wrong to allow this bill to pass through the house without congratulating the noble viscount lord colville on the way in which he has handled the legislation and on his clear and consistent explanations during its passage through this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for repeating the statement made by the secretary of state in another place <e> <s> we can begin to say that the truth is coming out as the truth will always do in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he tell the house whether the calculation he announced was

supplied to the select committee by the department of energy why not <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble viscount for moving the motion but i am afraid that i have to tell him that if your lordships were to accept the motion it would be without effect <e> <s> a simple calculation of the date on which the order was made and a look at the regulations under section of the companies act under which the order was made will show that the order was made on th june and that within days it had to be approved by a resolution of each house of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords before the house decides on whether the noble viscount can withdraw his motion could he give the house an assurance that dti ministers in future will get their act together <e> <s> there have been so

that his department has issued for consultation contain many sins of commission things that are undesirable if they are done but no sins of omission in the sense that if estate agents refrain from giving information they are not culpable <e> <s> is there not a gap in the orders <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord but i only obtained a copy <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he has not answered the question put by his noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> apart from those informal contacts and ensuring that financial objectives are met were the government consulted about this particular rise in charges and if so what attitude did they take <e> <s> will the noble lord tell the house whether the government have been consulted about the

stoddart of swindon <e> <s> has the fact that no new nuclear power stations have been commissioned in the united states set that country back in terms of nuclear technology <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to the question put by the noble viscount lord montgomery does not the minister accept that the french pwr is westinghouse technology <e>", "<cs> my lords relevance or system if the government chief whip would allow me to continue <e> <s> we were told that those amendments were not in order but we spent a great deal of time on second reading discussing their content <e> <s>

undertaking to this house that the government will stand by the undertaking that they gave <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the electricity industry is about to be privatised on the market <e> <s> is it not the case that it would be extremely damaging in the event of a flotation that there should be any form of industrial dispute <e> <s> does the no ale lord seriously believe that that is not a consideration which the management of the industry bears in mind when settling wages <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl bring us up to date regarding possible future discussions that may take place in the security council on military action in the gulf <e> <s> are such discussions envisaged in the near future <e> <s> can he explain the attitude of her majestys government regarding the seeking of chapter clearance for military action rather than relying on article <e>", "<cs> my lords i refer the noble and learned lord to the conventions of parliamentary language <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the gap in the noble lords mind to which he is referring <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my duty to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> i thank the minister for his winding-up speech which was full of jokes <e> <s> however i think most of them were unconscious jokes <e> <s> i understand that he is uncomfortable with statistics but we shall get back to that matter in time <e> <s> i am also glad to see so many noble lords opposite whose faces i do not recognise <e> <s> i am so glad that they have been attracted to your lordships house tonight by the quality of the speeches in the debate <e> <s> my noble friend lord peston tells me that many of the noble lords were not in the chamber to listen to the speeches <e> <s> however i am sure they were listening very carefully in the bar or wherever they were <e> <s> it remains for me simply to ask noble lords whether they agree with my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we have been reading in the press that there have been substantial moves towards drafting a security council resolution which would authorise the use of force in the gulf <e> <s> what progress has been made on that resolution <e> <s> we understand from a french spokesman that they are getting down to drafting the resolution <e> <s> is part of that resolution concerned with putting all the forces in the gulf under united nations command <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the soviet union been pressing for a united nations single command in this enterprise <e> <s> is it a condition of soviet support for the proposed security council resolution that such a command structure should be put in place <e>", "<cs> my lords we have come to the end of a long days debate <e> <s> i as others have congratulate the noble lord lord aldington and the committee on their report <e> <s> he must be feeling somewhat less shy at the end of today than he proclaimed himself to be earlier this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl be more forthcoming in response to the question of my noble friend lord stoddart of swindon <e> <s> have we not read in the press that the united states government have made certain agreements with the saudis and the kuwaitis in exile and that the japanese have contributed substantial sums in cash as well as in kind <e> <s> how much of that money is coming to the british government to pay for our costs in the gulf operation <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for introducing the order <e> <s> generally speaking it has our support <e> <s> we believe it is right that the collection of such statistics should be on a statutory basis and not on a voluntary basis <e> <s> to that extent we support the governments action <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the case that as lord justice taylor reported the army board not only refused to accept oral evidence as the noble lord lord harris said but did not meet on this occasion <e> <s> if so are there not serious implications in the procedures of the army board which the government need to address <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that the noble earl has raised a very serious problem <e> <s> the property sector is in deep trouble as a result of the recession <e> <s> it may have overborrowed in times of boom but that does not mean that banks should foreclose on their loans automatically and suddenly <e> <s> such action will land us in exactly the situation both in the property sector and in the banks that we had in the early s <e> <s> therefore will he urge the bank of england to be a little more active in trying to encourage the commercial banks to nurse companies back to health rather than trying to bring them down on a strict commercial basis <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not accept that it is not in the commercial banks interest to pull these loans <e> <s> does he not think that it is up to the banks together with the bank of england they need the reassurance of the bank of england if they are to nurse companies back to health in their own interest and the national interest to do this on a gradual and orderly basis <e> <s> it is not just a question of a contract and closing the contract just like that <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord benson for bringing this very important matter to your lordships attention <e> <s> as other noble lords pointed out the subject was debated in the house on th april <e> <s> the central point behind the noble lords motion is to ask what has taken place since that time <e> <s> we look forward to hearing the ministers reply and hope that he will be able to tell us exactly what has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government recognise the gravity of the problem <e> <s> two thousand jobs will be lost directly if cammell laird closes down and a further jobs will be lost among contractors <e> <s> that spells economic disaster for birkenhead and the wirral <e> <s> can the government think of a way to go back to the community and renegotiate the deal they made over privatisation <e> <s> after all we put enough money into the community <e> <s> could we not get some of our money back <e>"]
