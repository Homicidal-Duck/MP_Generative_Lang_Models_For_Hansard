["<cs> my lords it is with considerable diffidence that i rise to make my maiden speech not least when it is on a topic so complex as cable expansion and broadcasting policy <e> <s> while it may be seemly for television cameras to chronicle the affairs of barchester it may not be immediately apparent why those in lawn sleeves should repay the compliment and busy themselves with cable television and the future of public service broadcasting <e> <s> my pretext if i need one is that i am chairman of the central religious advisory committee <e> <s> it is a fully ecumenical body for it advises both the bbc and the iba and its members are drawn from the mainstream churches of britain and from some of the minority churches together with friends from the jewish and moslem communities <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to express my general support for the main thrust of the governments proposals in the white paper and for the way the government have responded to some of the anxieties expressed in the debates last autumn following publication of the hunt committee report in particular over how long public service broadcasting of its present quality could co-exist with entertainment-led cable television <e> <s> so for my part i very much welcome the governments recognition that they have a responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly sorry that my friend the right reverend prelate the bishop of lincoln is unable to contribute to this debate from these benches today <e> <s> through his long experience of industrial mission and his chairmanship of our industrial committee he has a wisdom and insight in these matters which i cannot claim to possess <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to start where the noble lord lord aylestone finished by giving a general welcome to the provision in the bill concerning the establishment of this cable authority and to the kind of oversight that it is expected to exercise <e> <s> many of us have felt that the role of the authority is of crucial importance and i am very glad that its duties powers and responsibilities have been so clearly spelled out in the bill <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment which the noble lord lord aylestone has moved <e> <s> i am sure that anything that can be done to increase the sense of involvement and accountability between those who are granted the franchise and the community which they are going to serve can obviously only be beneficial to the character of the service <e> <s> in another context i have had the honour of serving on one of the bbcs regional advisory committees <e> <s> it is quite clear from the content of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the intention of this new clause particularly subsection because i think that one of the things that it is important to strengthen in this bill is the whole area of public accountability and <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment and i very much hope that the noble lord the minister will be minded to accept it <e> <s> when we began the whole debate on cable television one of the arguments put forward was that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support to the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe <e> <s> there is no need to repeat the very cogent arguments which he and the noble lords lord mishcon and lord mottistone also put forward <e> <s> when we were debating these matters in december i ventured to say that i hoped that the government would look again at the possibility of the broadcasting commission having responsibility for these matters <e> <s> everything i have heard this afternoon persuades me that there is a strong case for this <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord the minister might think again and meet the wishes which are so widely expressed from all benches in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister would be willing to give an assurance to us because over and over again at different stages we have debated this issue and have sought to find the right formula of words which has been so elusive <e> <s> it may well be that in his heart the minister cannot find his way to agree to the words put forward by the noble lord lord jenkins of putney <e> <s> therefore i wonder whether in his reply the noble lord can tell us whether or not the secretary of state will be willing to give some guidance or code to the authority which will reflect the very considerable unease that has been expressed at each stage of the proceedings on the bill in this chamber our very real concern for the maintenance of adequate and proper standards as well as the unease expressed here that the words proper proportions are inadequate as we now have them <e> <s> if the noble lord the minister is able to say that there will be an agreement to give a positive encouragement to the authority to look for the maximum practicable amount of british and eec programmes i think that that would reassure some of us even in our disappointment at not being able to find the right wording all the way through in the actual amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak very briefly and apologise for speaking so late in the debate at this stage <e> <s> i should also like to add my word of gratitude and appreciation to the noble lord <e> <s> many of us in many parts of the house have been concerned over the last months as this bill has developed that the invention and development of cable television should not be at the expense of the public service broadcasting and the standards of public service broadcasting which we in this country uniquely enjoy <e> <s> therefore over and over again we have heard speeches expressing concern about standards about the desire to ensure that as many people as possible from the british television industry have opportunities to work in cable and to create programmes about handling complaints and so on <e> <s> we are grateful to the government for the concessions they have made and for the way they have met some of these anxieties <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord somers has indicated to me that he was not going to speak in the debate this evening because all the things that he wished to say had been well said by other speakers <e> <s> this was a self-denying ordinance which perhaps i myself would have done well to follow <e> <s> i want to say that i generally welcome the bill for many of the reasons which have been put forward earlier <e> <s> let us just remind ourselves that this bill has become necessary because of the large number of video cassette recorders that are now becoming available in our country <e> <s> the development in our decade of video cassette recorders is very similar to the great boom of television sets in the s years ago <e> <s> it is calculated that something like per cent <e> <s> of our homes now have video cassette recorders and it has been estimated that by the end of this decade the number may well have grown to something like per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords it was said of one of my predecessors that when he received a letter from downing street inviting him to go to the see of wakefield his first and very prudent action was to go out and invest in a gazeteer in order to discover where wakefield was <e> <s> your lordships will of course hardly need to be reminded that it is the administrative centre of what in the past years we have learned to call the metropolitan county of west yorkshire though there are many in my part of the world who still regret the passing of the ridings <e> <s> but miles down the road from us you will find a particular jewel in our diocesan crown which is the town of barnsley where are located the offices of the south yorkshire metropolitan county council which is somewhat unkindly referred to in our local press as the south yorkshire peoples republic <e> <s> over the past few years i have seen the work of the two yorkshire metropolitan county councils at first hand and i have got to know many of the councillors and many of the officials <e>"]
