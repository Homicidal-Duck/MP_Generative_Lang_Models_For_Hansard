["<cs> my lords i do not need to remind you that rising to ones feet for the first time in this august chamber is a daunting experience <e> <s> i was present one afternoon when the noble lord lord noel-baker made reference to his experience when making his maiden speech here and he spoke of the nervous anguish which he experienced at that time <e> <s> i for my part could never hope to approach the splendour of his oratory when that afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by acknowledging the indebtedness of the house to the noble lord lord chalfont for introducing this momentous subject and for expounding his views so ably and clearly <e> <s> i hesitated to put down my name to speak in this debate because i well realise my own ineligibility to speak on a subject so specialised as that of defence <e> <s> however after some painful consideration i decided to do so because for one thing these matters concern us all crucially <e> <s> after all it may take experts to be on the airing end of these weapons it does not take experts to be on the receiving end and i feel that the voice of a mere layman might not be out of place <e> <s> however i undertake not to keep your lordships more than a few minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are a significant number of young mothers in the country suffering painful anxiety about the future safety of their children under the threat of worldwide nuclear arms proliferation <e> <s> would he not agree that the highest priority for this or any government is to seek to reduce this threat by the vigorous pursuit of disarmament measures such as the one under discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not advocating <e>", "<cs> i apologise my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords let me first make my excuses to the house because i am unable to stay until the end of the debate as i have to catch a train <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join others of your lordships in thanking the noble lord lord jenkins of putney for initiating this very interesting debate <e> <s> i want to confine my remarks to the theatre which is my particular interest and for a few moments to take up the theme of the cottesloe about which we have just been hearing from the noble lord lord birkett <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl the minister for his presentation of the draft regulations <e> <s> i am prepared to go along with the minister a certain distance in agreeing that the scheme is showing some success within its own limitations <e> <s> it is i understand giving help to certain needy sections of society and notably one-parent families and families suffering from the impact of unemployment <e> <s> i believe also that a high proportion of the children of clergy are benefiting from the scheme <e> <s> these are indeed good sales points <e> <s> one can appreciate furthermore the <e>", "<cs> i did not have an opportunity to speak on this subject at second reading otherwise i might have said a great deal <e> <s> i promise your lordships committee that i shall not do so now <e> <s> but i should like to say a word or two because i feel that my experience may not be one that your lordships have all had that is to have been on the giving end and not on the receiving end of the cane <e> <s> i cast my mind back years to when i became headmaster of a small independent school for boys with educational and emotional problems <e> <s> at the time i took over the school it seemed necessary because the school was run on very liberal lines and i assure your lordships that i am not using the word politically and the boys had a great deal of freedom to have an ultimate or penultimate sanction which acted as a real deterrent <e> <s> so it was that the cane was used <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say one word in response to the comment of the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls about my saying that corporal punishment worked or that it proved effective <e> <s> it proved effective years ago <e> <s> i want to stress that and the fact that times have changed <e> <s> the climate of opinion has changed <e> <s> it is no longer accepted <e> <s> a punishment to be effective must be psychologically accepted <e> <s> it no longer is <e> <s> that was my point <e>", "<cs> i should like to put in a word here <e> <s> the noble baroness lady cox said that teachers always know and will always have the right information about when a child is handicapped or not <e> <s> in my experience of teaching handicapped children this is not always so <e> <s> they should know but they do not always know <e> <s> a child may exhibit very irritating symptoms such as hyperactivity or aggressiveness which may proceed from medical causes which are known about by the experts but not always by the teacher concerned <e> <s> one also has to consider that a teacher trying to cope with the difficulties of a large class may well forget in the heat of the moment that this or that child who is being a nuisance is in fact slightly handicapped <e> <s> i think it is a very prevalent situation <e> <s> i wish to question very strongly the statement of the noble baroness that the teacher always knows first he may not know and secondly he may forget <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very briefly like to approach the matter from a different angle and say a word about the regional arts associations which have not had very much said about them in all the debates that have taken place in the last few weeks and months <e> <s> we have heard a great deal about the arts council the glc and the metropolitan counties but we have heard very little about the regional arts associations which have over many years done a very fine job in the arts <e> <s> i say this particularly because they have paid attention to small and sometimes amateur groups of artists and this has very often been unheard of <e>", "<cs> my lords if the local authorites are to be called on to do a lot to replace funding that was undertaken before by the county authorities we cannot expect that they should deal with all multiple applications individually <e> <s> one cannot imagine a situation in which an arts organisation has to go to half a dozen different district or borough authorities in order to persuade them to support some scheme <e> <s> it is also extremely complicated for those councils to have to consider different applications from different quarters <e>", "<cs> my lords i too from these benches would like to thank the noble baroness the minister for explaining the regulations to us <e> <s> one can but approve the worthy aims of all of them <e> <s> i should like to applaud particularly those which are designed to help the disadvantaged the persons from ethnic minorities <e> <s> i think this is referring back to last year but i should like to ask the minister whether this covers adults <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not keep your lordships more than just a minute <e> <s> at the committee stage i said something which now feels rather like a public confession that is that many years ago when i was running a small school as headmaster i felt it was necessary to use the cane <e> <s> this was the feeling from the staff not just the feeling it was what they said and also it may surprise you from the hoys themselves <e> <s> this was their idea of justice and of seeing that justice was done <e> <s> but it was years ago <e> <s> i would not do it now <e> <s> it is not just because i have given up playing tennis <e> <s> it is because times have changed <e> <s> the climate of opinion has changed <e> <s> in an increasingly violent world i think all civilised educationists and perhaps all civilised people agree that violence breeds violence and that we are not likely to achieve any better purposes by putting the clock back <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness the minister for her encouraging reply to my question <e> <s> i should like to ask her whether she can give us any idea of what proportion of the cases of aids infection which have so far occurred in this country has been directly traceable to contamination from blood products <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be permitted to ask the noble baroness whether in view of the urgency of the situation and the very costly enterprise that the giving of the forthcoming blood tests to any would-be donors will involve any additional funding is to be available to the national health service and to the blood transfusion service <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first apologise that i was not here for the first few moments of this debate <e> <s> i should like to say that we on these benches are indebted to the noble baroness lady david for moving this prayer if that is what you do <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to cause the noble baroness any discomfort on her birthday but may i ask that she answer the question put to her by the noble baroness lady nicol namely whether there is screening of existing stocks of blood <e>", "<cs> my lords may we hope that the remaks to which the noble minister referred made by the director general of oftel to british telecom will bear some fruit <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether in view of the gravity of the situation in which for example a few weeks ago a boy of died in liverpool as a result of heroin poisoning and while children younger than that are getting involved in the use of soft drugs any consideration can be given to the possibility of some sort of national broadcast or series of broadcasts which will warn parents and children and anyone who has to do with children of the dangers that beset them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to express the sincere appreciation of the house to the noble lord lord stewart of fulham for having introduced this very interesting and very important subject <e> <s> i think that perhaps appreciation is due particularly because there are quite a lot of noble lords here and if i dare say so in your lordships house perhaps some who are a little hazy about just what community education constitutes <e> <s> we have heard of adult education and of further education but community education is quite a new idea and a new concept <e> <s> indeed i was told yesterday by someone who is actually working in the field that at the last count there were different definitions of it <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord stewart for having made my own mind much clearer <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express the thanks of these benches to the noble earl the minister for explaining to us the bill which is before the house <e> <s> like the noble lord lord mcintosh i do not want to widen the issue <e> <s> there is obviously a great temptation to do so <e> <s> but in order to explain what i want to say i feel i must say a little about the general situation <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his words on the subject <e> <s> i feel i can say no more if it is believed that this is sufficiently clear <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should just like to add one word to what the noble lord lord mcintosh has said <e> <s> it is important not only that any supervisory staff coming from outside should be adequately trained but perhaps more important that they should be of the right personality <e> <s> the teacher or anyone in charge of children needs to be the right kind of person <e> <s> bearing that in mind i hope that the noble earl may be able to use his influence to bring it about that head teachers are closely consulted when the supervisory staff in their schools are being selected <e> <s> head teachers will have a much better idea than anybody else what kind of people they want in their schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to acknowledge our gratitude to the noble lord lord irving of dartford for having inaugurated this very important debate on the subject of schools <e> <s> he has painted a sympathetic picture of the teachers situation and a dark picture of the situation in our schools <e> <s> i thought i was going to do the same but i found when i began to ask some questions of certain teachers that i had some encouraging replies from them so i hope to cheer you up a little my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just draw the noble lords attention to the fact that the sadlers wells theatre cannot be described as exclusively a receiving theatre since it acts as an entrepreneur for foreign dance and drama companies <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that several of them are arriving this year including the chinese ballet which is due to arrive at the time that her majesty the queen is going to visit china in the autumn and that it would be a national disgrace if there were no theatre for it to come to <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement which i would describe as emollient and perhaps not entirely discouraging <e> <s> however i should like to point out that the nut is mentioned in the second part of the statement and i am not very sanguine that it will agree to the provisional agreement through acas <e> <s> for certain reasons i do not think the nut is likely to come into line <e> <s> the amount offered in the proposed settlement for is not acceptable to the nut <e> <s> no money at all has been offered by the government for that proposed settlement and no mention has been made of the aspiration to approach the houghton levels of pay which all teachers ultimately hope to receive nor of the aim or comparability with other professions at which teachers throughout the dispute of the last year have been aiming <e>", "<cs> my lords before embarking upon my speech i wish to make a number of points <e> <s> i wish first to apologise to your lordships in that i may not be able to stay until the end of this long and important debate <e> <s> secondly i wish to express appreciation to the noble baroness lady cox for introducing this subject which has attracted so many speakers <e> <s> i want to express my appreciation of the splendid delivery of her speech but also to inform her that i am not going to join her crusade <e> <s> nor would i recommend the alliance to do so <e> <s> i should also like to make a reference to the gentleman who has been mentioned mr nicholson <e> <s> i too happen to have heard that he has been very inactive as the political officer in charge of political education in the ilea <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for his fairly predictable reply <e> <s> but may i point out that the library of the british theatre association is unique not only in this country but also in the world and that its research facilities are used by professional and amateur theatre companies producers and actors from all over the world <e> <s> would he not agree that this collection must not be allowed to lapse or to be dispersed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord the minister for that encouraging reply and express appreciation of what is being done but may i also be churlish enough to point out that this amount does not look like being enough <e> <s> would the minister not agree that for a theatre of such renown as sadlers wells some more permanent steady and stable funding is required than these comparatively makeshift manoeuvres <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo the words of the noble lord lord hayter in proposing that we should give the bill a benign second reading <e> <s> i think that it requires clarification and amendment especially in connection with the matter of entry charges and exit charges as the noble lord lord jenkins himself said <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on these benches would like to thank the noble earl for his clear exposition of the bill <e> <s> but a good deal of the measure we have to say does not conform to the claims made by the noble earl that it will clarify such matters as the respective responsibilities of leas head teachers and governing bodies <e> <s> as i shall try to point out we find these claims by no means justifiable <e>", "<cs> i should like to express general support for the amendment on grounds that have already been put forward by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i think that that degree of flexibility is highly desirable as opposed to the rigid codification of the bill <e> <s> local education authorities in different parts of the country and at different times may well wish to vary the size of governing bodies <e> <s> one is thinking in particular of their size <e> <s> it is difficult to imagine that a governing body with as many as members is a good idea <e> <s> with the amendment the possibility of having smaller governing bodies becomes possible <e>", "<cs> may i say a few words in reply to the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour <e> <s> i favour the addition of parents <e> <s> they are of course a very welcome and necessary addition to governing bodies <e> <s> i also favour the inclusion of pupil governors <e> <s> subsection <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a word in strong agreement with the wise words of the noble lord lord taylor in supporting the idea of support staff in a school <e> <s> these people who caretake and look after the children out of the school and look after the school when no one else is there are terribly important and often get forgotten <e> <s> they are the people who know about the school from the inside <e> <s> if one had to make a choice i would choose members of the staff of that sort rather than any outsiders <e> <s> i wanted to say that though i must also say that it would be regrettable if one could only accommodate them on a governing body at the expense of co-opted or foundation governors <e>", "<cs> i should also like to add my support for the amendment <e> <s> the main thing that i should like to say is that the system has been working as far as i can gather for some years <e> <s> i know one school where it has been in operation for years <e> <s> it is possible that the pupils have been co-opted on to the governing body or something of that sort <e>", "<cs> may i make one point <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton spoke of attendance at governors meetings imperilling young peoples chances in examinations <e> <s> i should like to point out that the average number of times a governing body meets in a year is three and this will not imperil their academic chances <e>", "<cs> i feel that we have threshed out this amendment and i offer my thanks to all who have contributed to trying to undo this knotty point <e> <s> on the undertaking from the noble baroness that the matter will be looked into i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> i am aware that the amendment as worded appears in the first half to offer to the head teacher the power to veto and this i feel is too strongly worded <e> <s> my plea was that the head teacher should have the right to see the names and to object and if objection were overruled that would have to be accepted <e> <s> however in the circumstances and bearing in mind what the minister has said about the facilities already being available i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in strong support of the amendment particularly with reference to the confusion which seems to me to exist between clauses and as referred to already by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> first on clause subsections and seem to me to be entirely unnecessary <e> <s> according to subsection the local education authority is to determine curriculum policy <e> <s> surely in doing this it will fulfil the provisions of subsection that is it will consider the range of the curriculum and the balance among the components and this does not have to be specifically stated <e> <s> further in subsection how and why should it be imagined that the local education authority will forget its curriculum policy when carrying out its functions <e> <s> that too seems to me to be an unnecessary provision and it must be the aim of any good act to be clear and as brief as possible <e>", "<cs> the question of amendment no <e> <s> a has been touched on several times <e> <s> would it make sense or am i out of order in suggesting that we should decide we are also discussing amentment no <e> <s> a at the same time as amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his words <e> <s> i would not pretend that the wording of the <e>", "<cs> as an ex-teacher may i add a few words <e> <s> i shall not keep the committee for more than a minute or two <e> <s> having spent a lifetime teaching academic subjects i cannot imagine anything that is more important to teach than the subjects named in this amendment <e> <s> they appear to me to deal with realities in a way that a great deal that is taught in our schools does not <e> <s> i support the amendment with all the strength in my power <e>", "<cs> i apologise in advance if some of the things that i want to say on this occasion are a little muddled <e> <s> i had so many ideas coming up from sussex in the train but the southern region is not as smooth as it might be and so in some places i found that i could not read my own writing <e> <s> that as an ex-schoolmaster i find bad <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord has said is perfectly true <e> <s> i want to reiterate two points that have been made this afternoon and i shall be very brief <e> <s> first it has just been said by the noble baroness lady masham that if children are bad you have to look in the home <e> <s> from many years of having had dealings with children i know this so well <e> <s> they are not bad because of anything that happens or does not happen at school they are bad because of what happens at home <e>", "<cs> we should have clear in our minds the difference between a duty and a voluntary activity <e> <s> the two paragraphs of the subsection very clearly make a division <e> <s> the first relates to duties and nobody can deny that if anything is to be appraised duties should be appraised and the second relates to activities which are not duties <e> <s> duties are obviously such things as teaching preparing for lessons parent meetings staff meetings supervision and the like as the noble lord lord somers mentioned <e> <s> in my view he was referring to supervision duties <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak for a moment or two about the difficulty that will be involved in appraisal in a scheme any more structured than that which exists already <e> <s> it is going to be very expensive <e> <s> we are not talking about that today but i mention it in passing <e> <s> extra staff will be needed as well as a great deal of extra computerisation filing and goodness knows what else <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words in support of my noble friend lord kilmarnock <e> <s> this clause is causing considerable apprehension among the teaching profession and such an amendment as my noble friend proposes would give teachers some reassurance that the secretary of states proposals will be scrutinised <e> <s> the teachers do not know what may come forth from on high that is the trouble <e> <s> a provision such as that proposed would give them some reassurance <e> <s> i am afraid that all this arises from the lack of trust that at the moment obtains between the teaching profession and the secretary of state <e> <s> a provision such as my noble friend proposes would do something to give reassurance in a very sensitive situation <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to speak on this amendment but i think it would be quite inappropriate if a word were not said from these benches in total support of the noble baroness <e> <s> lady cox <e> <s> i have nothing very exciting to add to what has already been said by noble lords except that i do recollect on many occasions having to supervise swimming at school <e> <s> i do not think swimming has been mentioned <e> <s> i was always in dread and fear of having to cope with an accident which involved drowning or half drowning <e> <s> that is yet another thing that can arise <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words about a parallel case also from buckinghamshire concerning three schools one at stokenchurch the bartholomew tipping school and two in high wycombe the pembroke and wellsbourne schools <e> <s> the story is that in october the local education authority announced the proposed closure of those schools <e> <s> this would involve disruption for something like children of secondary school age that is to say at a very crucial and vulnerable stage of their education <e> <s> the parents involved got their act together and organised protests and objections <e> <s> they made their feelings felt both to the education authority and also to the secretary of state <e> <s> it was not until february that the secretary of states decision was made and the decision was announced that the closure would go forward <e> <s> he also said that he was not required to state his reasons for closing the three schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to my newly-found noble friend lord kirkwood for what seemed to me an admirably concise and incisive speech without a word wasted <e> <s> a number of your lordships have spoken of what one might call the top end of the education ladder <e> <s> i have been largely concerned in my experience with the lower end <e> <s> it is that about which i wish to speak together with the position of teachers <e> <s> i am afraid that my theme is again doom <e> <s> really it is demoralisation demoralisation at the lower end of the pupil ladder and demoralisation of the teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like from these benches to thank the noble earl for repeating the statement <e> <s> it is indeed welcome news that an interim settlement has been reached <e> <s> it is particularly welcome that the national union of teachers has accepted it and will henceforth take part in the important discussions with acas <e> <s> it is good also that an undertaking has been given that there will be no further disruption in schools while deliberations with acas are continuing <e> <s> it looks at last as though there is light at the end of the tunnel in respect of a desperately damaging situation in our schools with the prospect of a solution being found perhaps by the end of the summer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words in support of the amendment on the ground that it is the teachers who are the professionals and who know about education <e> <s> the other members of the proposed governing bodies are when all is said and done laymen and what is more they may be tinged with political feelings however teachers are primarily concerned with the question of teaching <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a few words in support of what the noble lord lord mcintosh has said <e> <s> i should like to begin by a further reference to the taylor report which said <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that one of the problems that we have to face is a realisation of what is happening <e> <s> it is easy as we sit here and debate these weighty matters to get out of touch with reality and to fail to realise the difficulty of the situation that is facing teachers and head teachers particularly in for example london schools <e> <s> in rural areas teachers avoid those subjects like the plague they are terrified of them <e> <s> they do not want the children going home and telling their parents that they have been subjected to marxist talk or to right-wing propaganda <e>", "<cs> my lords i crave the indulgence of your lordships for having misunderstood what the noble viscount the leader of the house said <e> <s> we are more than prepared to accept his guarantee <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady young for her helpful words <e> <s> the position of a head teacher is difficult and only he knows when the time has come that he can no longer contain pupils within his school <e> <s> i made that point when we were discussing the matter in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her words on this matter <e> <s> it is unfortunate that the government do not feel able to accommodate the feelings of those most closely involved in this matter but in view of what she says i do not see that any more can be said at this stage other than that one hopes it may be done in another place at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is such an unusual experience to hear such words from the front bench that i do not know how i should receive them except to say that i am very grateful <e> <s> i trust that the amendment as proposed will have a safe voyage in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her words of encouragement interest and concern <e> <s> it was really my main object i must confess to air the matter and to ask her to be kind enough which she was to say that she will draw the attention of her right honourable friend the secretary of state to this issue about which there are many very concerned parents <e> <s> your lordships may be interested to know that the school which has children though i think it may be children by now and which is under threat of closure had within it in the s children happily installed <e> <s> in view of those matters and the kindness of your lordships in listening to me at this late stage on this major issue and in the hope as i say that the secretary of state if appealed to will take a sympathetic view of the concerns of parents i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i too should like to say just a few words and indeed to echo the words of the noble lord lord mcintosh as to the unfailing courtesy shown by the government front-bench spokesmen over this bill <e> <s> in doing so i should like to withdraw the expressions of amazement which i indicated when they showed signs of being conciliatory over the amendment that was proposed earlier today on the subject of political education in schools <e> <s> in fact this has happened on numerous occasions and the government spokesmen have not only been courteous but have also done their best to address the concerns that we have shown <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to thank the minister for her clear exposition of the regulations <e> <s> the substantial change is in the table contained in regulation with the updating of the bands of income <e> <s> i too should like to draw attention to the fact that they are between and per cent <e> <s> which seems to us to be on the generous side <e> <s> it is presumably intended to be in line with the increased average earning rate rather than the rate of inflation but this does not seem to us to be the right time to be generous even to that comparatively small extent in a venture that affects less than per cent <e> <s> of children in the maintained sector <e>", "<cs> my lords the only question i should be interested in the answer to is the net overall cost of the scheme <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness understands what i mean <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble baroness for her clear exposition of the new <e>", "<cs> my lords if we may return to what we were discussing earlier may i ask the minister how much exchange of information exists within commonwealth countries as to courses and resources that exist in other commonwealth countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i was seeking information on how much accurate knowledge is disseminated throughout the commonwealth of what is currently available in other parts of the commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a great many head teachers in areas of high immigration need to assemble the whole school once daily but have great difficulty in performing an act of specific christian worship because the preponderance of the pupils are not christian <e> <s> in that case the parents do not send their children so the head teachers will not have a complete assembly of the whole school <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness the minister for her explanation of this bill and to express the willing acceptance from these benches of its provisions <e> <s> we are pleased that the two bodies named in clause are to receive support from the department for the excellent work that they undoubtedly do <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that further discussion of this question is a waste of time until we know the facts <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government have any plans to implement the recommendations in the hmi report that the sale of junk foods on school premises should be prohibited <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want unduly to prolong the discussion <e> <s> this matter was discussed at considerable length in another place one night last week until everyone was exhausted and i should hate your lordships to become so <e> <s> i am a little worried that the government do not have governing bodies quite right <e> <s> they are aiming in the right direction but there is a tendency to assume that if a responsibility is handed to governing bodies all problems are solved <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement <e> <s> i wish to reiterate the words of the noble lord <e> <s> lord mcintosh <e> <s> it is unfortunate that the statement has come two years too late <e> <s> all the disruption and distress that the profession parents and children have endured during that time could have been avoided <e> <s> among other things the question of out-of-school duties for teachers would not have become the bone of contention that it is <e> <s> as we know teachers have withdrawn their services from such activities as midday supervision parents meetings supervision of the arrival and departure of children supervision of out-of-school activities and extracurricular activities <e> <s> they have been forced to withdraw their voluntary service in what have now become issues for confrontation and matters of binding duties <e> <s> this has led to the rather harsh words used by the secretary of state when he refers to there being no ambiguity about teachers duties and how they must be sharply defined and clarified <e> <s> it is regrettable that services and activities freely given previously on a voluntary basis should now become matters of no ambiguity and of sharp definition and clarification <e> <s> so there is a strong element of tough bargaining <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> does she agree that the per cent <e> <s> under achievement rate that we hear of in our schools is a matter of grave concern that it seems likely that the root cause in a large number of these cases is a deficiency in the basic skills of english and that in a number of such cases a neurologically based reading disability is a cause <e> <s> in those circumstances would not an investigation of this sort be profitable <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships would have been treated to an impassioned harangue from me but when i heard i had only five minutes in which to speak i did a drastic surgical operation on my speech <e> <s> that may mean that what is left may have a slightly amputated appearance <e> <s> however i should like to try to make six points <e> <s> if i have made only five by the time the clock says that i have spoken for five minutes i shall stop <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her informative reply <e> <s> i should like to ask her whether she can say more about where the evidence of inadequate teaching is to be found <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> it is devoutly to be hoped that we are getting nearer to an agreement in this appalling conflict <e> <s> the tuc and the parents have endorsed the agreement recently made between employers and employees <e> <s> teachers are at this moment involved in their own democratic processes <e> <s> i believe that the nut will start to ballot its members on monday and the assistant masters and mistresses association is doing so at the moment <e> <s> i should like to reiterate the words of the noble lord lord irving <e> <s> i too hope that the secretary of state will not feel it necessary to intervene at any point directly in the settlement of the pay dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my appreciation to the noble lord lord winstanley for introducing this important subject <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords other members of your lordships house and especially my noble friend lady seear have spoken and will speak of the wider implications of the proposed bill <e> <s> as a former teacher i should like to focus on the likely impact on teachers and their feelings on the measure <e> <s> at this point i should like to accept the words of the right reverend prelate the bishop of london i am sorry that he is not in his place when he said that throughout the whole of this unhappy dispute no party to the disagreement could be regarded as blameless <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the arguments and would like to make some further points in response to them <e> <s> my main reason for introducing this amendment is that in the present overheated and stressful state of affairs in the teaching profession many teachers and others involved will be greatly reassured by the very use of the word consultation <e> <s> it is the absence of the word and of the idea of consultation that is causing so much anxiety about this bill <e> <s> the mere suggestion of consultation at this stage would allay a great deal of anxiety <e> <s> i accept that there would be difficulties about the many bodies that would have to be consulted <e> <s> my idea is simply that the secretary of state should use those bodies to get ideas <e> <s> where else will he look for ideas <e> <s> they may just come out of his head <e> <s> we have all turned to interested parties and asked who do you suggest <e> <s> in effect they will be nominating members of a committee <e> <s> however the secretary of state does not have to follow the suggestions that are made <e>", "<cs> i accept that with thanks <e> <s> i never quite know what to do in these circumstances but i express my gratitude and appreciation <e>", "<cs> in these amendments as well as in a number of others what those of us who have moved amendments are bearing in mind is the public image <e> <s> i know that many people are concerned about the authoritarian almost dictatorial tone of some of the provisions of the bill <e> <s> if that could be avoided the bill would commend itself much more readily to those it is going to affect <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a word in support of this amendment <e> <s> being in close touch with teachers as i am most of the time i know the state of mind that they are in at the moment <e> <s> i also know that any such concession as this knowing that they will be consulted would be some balm to their hurt feelings <e> <s> i cannot see that any harm could be done by it <e> <s> i think that they would be reassured to know that there was at least to be consultation on the decisions of the secretary of state in this connection <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add that during that exposition of the amendment the committee was very far from laughing <e> <s> i noticed that noble lords were extremely attentive and i do not think it would be at all accurate to describe it as having been nearly laughed out of court <e>", "<cs> if i may add a further word to that the minister referred to other committees that are directly appointed by the secretary of state <e> <s> indeed they may work reasonably satisfactorily <e> <s> the difference here is that we have a very inflammatory situation <e> <s> the teachers of the country have been under great stress i am not suggesting that others have not also been under great stress for a long time past and they are extremely dismayed and anxious about this bill <e> <s> when they hear of a committee that is to be directly appointed by the secretary of state they are highly suspicious of it <e> <s> the circumstances of those other committees to which the noble lord referred which are now settled and accepted do not arouse the same reaction and emotion that this is likely to <e>", "<cs> i do not pretend to know the answer to the difficulty that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has brought to our notice but i do know that the eyes of those in the education world are on us <e> <s> i think that this is the moment to give them a clear message of something that will reassure them <e> <s> in that i am in total agreement with the noble lords lord houghton and lord alexander who said that they will be reassured only by knowing that there is a final and definite cut-off date <e> <s> if unfortunately no negotiating machinery has been decided upon by that time the alliance government which by then will be directing affairs will no doubt introduce new legislation to give another year in which a settlement may be reached <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for her words and for the little dent that we have made in this bill <e> <s> it was stated in the press yesterday i do not remember which newspaper that we had made no dent but i consider that the word interim is a tiny dent and i am hoping that today we have made another <e> <s> it is quite difficult because underneath the velvet cloak there is a concrete wall <e> <s> however i thank the minister <e>", "<cs> i have listened to what has been said and i suppose that i must bow to the superior knowledge that has been shown <e> <s> i must admit that i had not taken that sufficiently into account <e> <s> however i think that there is a difference between the committee about which we are talking and the committees that have been referred to by the noble baroness and the noble lord lord beloff the research committee and the university grants committee <e> <s> there has never been so far as i know any suggestion that they would be politically manipulated <e> <s> the unfortunate point about this committee is that there has been much suggestion of that not merely in your lordships house but in the other place <e> <s> there has been considerable suggestion from the educational world as well as local government that this committee will simply consist of the puppets of the secretary of state <e> <s> therefore this is a small gesture which would give them a little independence and something of the dignity which we feel the committee may lack <e> <s> self-respect was the word which the noble lord lord mcintosh used and that is a word which i thought of in that connection <e> <s> it is important that they should have self-respect <e> <s> it seems to me that such a gesture would in the circumstances be appropriate <e> <s> however i do not feel that i can press the matter at this moment and i have no alternative but to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words on behalf of the teachers as i do quite often in your lordships house <e> <s> i too have received countless letters from teachers and from schools throughout the country <e> <s> the letters that have impressed me most have not been those from the teachers associations or from local education authorities one expected those but those from individual teachers <e> <s> in particular i have received letters from the entire teaching staff of two schools signed by every member of the staff and by head teachers and deputy heads who stand to gain <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a word in support of this amendment and in doing so i wish to put a question to the minister <e> <s> it does not appear anywhere in the bill that the advisory committee is going to be responsible for making proposals for new machinery for setting teachers pay and conditions <e> <s> in that case who is going to be responsible for this <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister whether or not in this question due account has been taken by the government of the considerable extent of illiteracy in the country among english speaking people <e> <s> therefore there is the probability that the leaflets will arrive in a number of households where they will not be read because the family are illiterate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her reply and i am most encouraged to hear that a reply has at last been received <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether or not her majestys government are fully aware of the extent of the disquiet and anxiety felt by many parents of the borough at the prospect of their children being exposed to they know not what in the way of unorthodox moral suggestions <e> <s> in particular may i ask whether the government realises that a lot of the anxiety comes from ethnic communities for example <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply which is encouraging up to a point <e> <s> however is he aware of a recently published report which covers the borough of newham for the year up to march in which it is shown that cases of racial harassment took place of which only <e>", "<cs> my lords i too from these benches would like to extend a warm welcome to the noble earl who is back in his former place <e> <s> i am sure that both sides of the house greatly appreciate his conscientiousness and courtesy <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me the greatest pleasure to follow the speech of the noble earl lord stockton most particularly because i agreed with so much of what he said <e> <s> his warm words about the education service and the need to support our teachers were indeed heartening <e> <s> i should like to feel as i am sure will all your lordships that it is merely the beginning of a career in your lordships house which will complete or fulfil the work begun by his illustrious grandfather <e> <s> also i am greatly looking forward to hearing the maiden speech of the noble baroness lady blatch and i am sure that we shall enjoy that greatly too <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his particularly clear exposition of the new regulations to which we on these benches also have no objection <e> <s> i have the impression that the only times at which i have had the honour to speak on this subject in your lordships house previously have been during the dinner hour or at some other time when attendance was a bit sparse <e> <s> as the stalls are now a bit fuller i should like to say from these benches that we also regret the necessity for this scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that today i am undergoing the experience which my pupils used to have in class when they were required to summarise a lengthy passage into something that occupied only two paragraphs <e> <s> i have prepared a <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the proposed pilot projects for the year was <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take this opportunity to speak briefly to this amendment because i did not have a chance to do so yesterday and i believe that this is the right move to make <e> <s> in raising the subject in the way in which it has been raised in this clause of the bill i feel that we have opened a pandoras box of troubles and revealed a great deal of explosive emotional material which it would have been much better not to release <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to the point raised by the noble lord lord orr-ewing about opting out can the minister confirm that parents already have the right to remove their children from any act of worship in which they do not wish them to take part <e> <s> i cannot say whether this provision is in the or the act but perhaps she can confirm that this is so <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the minister in a qualified way for repeating the statement <e> <s> i do not think that i have ever been impolite in your lordships house hitherto but i propose to be now at the expense not of noble lords but of the governments proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is a school in the borough of lambeth which i happen to be visiting tomorrow the head teacher of which is utterly dismayed at the prospect of her school being handed over to the tender mercies of the local authority whose leader <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has made the point that no local authority could be taken to task for promoting homosexuality if a teacher made a wrong step or a suggestion in the classroom such as the noble lord lord gifford referred to because that teacher is not answerable to the local authority <e> <s> are we to understand from that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that insecurity and uncertainty about the governments intentions over the last year in <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for her clear exposition of the bill <e> <s> i also express my appreciation of the fact that i have the great privilege of speaking early when there is a long list of illustrious names to follow me <e> <s> i shall try to be as brief and relevant as i can but where i fail i too will blame the government for producing such a lengthy and compendious document <e> <s> i shall confine myself to the question of schools and leave to other of my noble friends on these benches who have much greater experience the subject of further and higher education <e>", "<cs> i take issue with two points made by the noble viscount lord eccles <e> <s> he said that it was only the bad inadequate or inefficient local authorities and only the poor schools which resisted the idea of a national curriculum and of testing <e> <s> i consider that to be a grave injustice <e> <s> i have been in touch with many local authorities with professional bodies from the highest to the humblest and with parents and teachers <e> <s> in no case have i received any impression that it was the inadequate schools which were resisting the national curriculum <e> <s> if anything i would say that the situation is to the contrary and that they are the most concerned to give the best education to their children <e>", "<cs> i should like to make three very brief points from these benches <e> <s> i am not sure whether i speak on behalf of my noble friends but i speak on my own behalf and possibly on theirs as well <e> <s> i think that brevity is important at this moment <e>", "<cs> i was by no means implying that <e> <s> i am well aware that it also comes from the independent sector to an extent <e>", "<cs> there is one further matter that i still do not understand <e> <s> why was amendment no <e> <s> called before amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i think i am right in saying that i am the only peer who has actually moved an amendment the others have merely been spoken to in connection with mine <e> <s> therefore it falls to me to say a final word about it <e> <s> we have been debating the national curriculum for nearly hours and one wonders whether we have achieved anything good <e> <s> i must say that the prize goes to the civil servants who thought up a thousand or two negative answers how to say no in a thousand different ways <e>", "<cs> the grouping seems to have given rise to some confusion <e> <s> in the circumstances and at this hour of the morning i bid the committee good morning and ask leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> in clause reference is made to the powers of the secretary of state but not to his obligations <e> <s> i should like to speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> a and which relate to testing in our schools <e> <s> it is a very important matter for the attention of members of the committee <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words to correct an impression that my noble friend lord mcnair and i may have given <e> <s> the situation is not that i support testing and he does not <e> <s> as he said he was speaking to amendment no <e> <s> which proposes that there should not be any assessment arrangements specified at the first key stage <e> <s> that is not to say that he does not approve of assessments but merely that they should not be specified by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i think not but i shall have to look again <e> <s> the report states <e>", "<cs> i think that we have talked about this long enough but i should like to say a final word <e> <s> i think that the minister has been giving us sweet talk <e> <s> the problem of the noble baroness is that the government themselves have not made up their mind what they think about the matter so that she is in considerable difficulty <e> <s> they should have made up their mind by now <e> <s> we on our side feel it is not appreciated in high quarters that a great many teachers and parents are very worried <e> <s> all they know is what is contained in the bill namely that the secretary of state can do anything and everything <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill to reassure us that he will consult anyone <e>", "<cs> i think in that case that we need to test the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> i have listened with amazed interest to what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> it is not very often that we have this sort of pleasure extended to us <e> <s> in those circumstances i am very pleased to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i think this is an epitome of the whole bill <e> <s> it bears every sign of haste in the drafting and so the form that it has taken <e>", "<cs> i assure the committee that we are not going to fall into that habit <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for her assurance and i hope that she will be able to bring a favourable reply at the next stage of the bill bearing in mind especially the lack of connection that we feel exists between the lofty aims of clause and much of the rest of the bill <e> <s> i believe that every time a reference is made to clause and the basic aims of the bill that is a gain <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a word in support of the amendment <e> <s> i think that one of the defects from which the proposed national curriculum suffers is a word which came into my mind and which i subsequently looked up in the dictionary namely jejune <e> <s> i thought that the word meant scanty or meagre and according to <e>", "<cs> i understood the minister to imply that all the actions of a secretary of state would always be reasonable <e> <s> i find that statement questionable <e> <s> the actions of this particular secretary of state may be reasonable but what may we have in the future <e> <s> if there is a refusal how can one appeal on what are considered to be unreasonable grounds <e>", "<cs> i do not find that answer very reassuring or satisfying <e> <s> however at the moment i can make no further suggestions <e> <s> i should like to reword the amendment and bring back the idea on report <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for her kind words <e> <s> this is the third time that i have had such kind words from the government so i hardly know my luck <e> <s> we shall look forward to what comes next <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot really understand the governments argument on this matter because i think the question of choice in this particular context at any rate is largely illusory <e> <s> i know nothing about economics because such things were not taught when i was at school but i think it is probably still true that if the supply exceeds the demand for anything whether it is schools or bottles of milk there is considerable choice whereas if the demand exceeds the supply there is little or no choice <e> <s> in the case of schools the demand and the supply have to be equal or very nearly equal <e> <s> if that is the case i do not see how provisions such as the ones that the government are proposing will make very much difference <e>", "<cs> in that case that leads immediately on to the next thing i wanted to say <e> <s> schools can become popular or unpopular very often for no good reason <e> <s> i have had experience of that and i believe that the committee may have had experience of that too <e> <s> i shall not name the actual schools but in my nearby town there is one comprehensive school and in another town miles away there is another comprehensive school <e> <s> there has been a time during which the school in my nearby town has become unpopular for no great reason <e> <s> i have heard children say that they were going to one of those schools because they thought it was a very good school and that it was a better school than the other <e> <s> parents and children are not always well informed they are not always intelligent and they very often follow one another like sheep just because a certain school suddenly acquires a good reputation <e> <s> sometimes for quite an incidental reason one school becomes the popular school <e>", "<cs> no i certainly would not suggest that <e> <s> i come back to the context of schools again and not motor cars and roads <e> <s> in that context it is important that an authority in this case the local education authority should be able to exercise some judgment as to the numbers in the schools within its area in order that as many parents as possible and if possible all parents should be satisfied and all children should be well educated <e>", "<cs> no one surely could wish to preserve bad schools <e> <s> i am sure that the object of us all is to ensure that all schools are as good as they can be in the circumstances <e> <s> i am worried about children whose parents are not concerned <e> <s> they matter just as much as children whose parents are concerned <e>", "<cs> i have listened as carefully as i could to the reply of the minister but there are several amendments under discussion and i shall want to have a look at <e>", "<cs> i wish to add a few words in support of the amendment <e> <s> i feel very strongly that adult education is of the greatest possible importance to the health and happiness of so many people <e> <s> basically i am thinking of the right that we have almost established or which we are on the way to establishing of an adult to be able to educate himself and to continue to educate himself from the cradle to the grave <e> <s> that is the principle of community education <e> <s> i am thinking of the number of adults who as my noble friend lady seear said feel that they failed at school and want a second chance <e> <s> the fact that one has failed at school may not be entirely ones fault <e> <s> one needs a second chance and adult education provides that <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a general word or two <e> <s> i too support the amendment <e> <s> i hope that the government will take seriously the unfortunate events which recently took place <e> <s> the first was in dewsbury and the other was the unfortunate occurrence in manchester <e> <s> such matters must be taken seriously and not treated lightly <e> <s> two basic facts should be borne in mind about the whole issue <e> <s> one is that the handling of the problem within one school depends more than anything else on the quality of the head teacher <e> <s> if he knows how to handle the difficult question of a multi-ethnic population within his school everyone will be happy together <e> <s> however if he does not disasters can happen examples of which we have heard about <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from the governments consultation paper that if a governing body or a local education authority wants a teacher for a specific school it can apply for that teacher to be given a licence <e> <s> how long is it likely to be before a licence is granted <e> <s> if a period of say two years training intervenes the need for that teacher may have disappeared before he is on the staff <e> <s> how long will the school have to wait <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support this amendment <e> <s> when one considers that we are talking about a scottish amendment there may well be a moral in it the scots have always taken education seriously the english have only ever put up with it <e> <s> i have a feeling that the bill reflects that situation <e>", "<cs> my lord the tag after my title indicates the contrary <e> <s> my family came from north of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that from these benches we also support this amendment <e> <s> there are three areas which are lacking in this bill and this is one of them <e> <s> another is the environment and the third is life skills which children should be taught and we shall discuss that later <e> <s> however we strongly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak in support of this amendment <e> <s> since the dinner break we have been debating to my mind the three most important subjects that children should be taught <e> <s> so far in each case the government have produced a firm negative <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my support to the amendments from these benches <e> <s> i was a teacher of drama and i have seen the transforming power that drama has on children particularly on those who lack confidence or who <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government intend drama and dance to take place why do they not say so by using a general term the arts <e> <s> what can be the objection to it <e> <s> that is what i cannot understand <e>", "<cs> my lords they do not cover dance and drama <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i am right in saying that the number of languages that are spoken in london at the moment is something like <e> <s> if that figure is wrong it is not far wrong <e> <s> do i understand that all these languages are to be permitted by the secretary of state as alternatives to the learning of english <e>", "<cs> my lords what does one do if one is still not clear in ones mind <e> <s> may we take it that the minister will do what she can to persuade her right honourable friend to see to it that the national curriculum council weighs these considerations and that in considering what languages may or may not be taught it will take into consideration the fact that many children in the country may need to be taught their mother tongue more urgently than any western european language <e> <s> if that is the case i am prepared to withdraw the amendment but i should like some assurance to that effect <e> <s> is it possible to have that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am still not satisfied with that and in view of my dissatisfaction i shall have to ask the house to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say i do not think that the present situation is very satisfactory <e> <s> so far as i remember we had a -minute discussion on the matter in committee <e> <s> further without wishing to flatter the members of this house i do not think that we are short of brains in this place <e> <s> if it is possible to debate the matter for minutes surely there must be some lack of clarity <e> <s> as the minister has finished her reply i do not think that i can ask her to reconsider the matter <e> <s> however i shall be most grateful to hear anything she has to say about the compatability with existing legislation which seems to me to make confusion worst confounded <e> <s> with those words i feel that i must withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her reply which is to some extent reassuring and encouraging <e> <s> i am glad that we have talked briefly about this because records of achievement are not mentioned in the bill <e> <s> one has the feeling that what happened two three of five years ago has a tendency to be forgotten <e> <s> however it obviously has not been forgotten <e> <s> the initiative is proceeding and i hope that we shall see good results in due course <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> i am reminded of something which someone said to me a day or so ago that whenever one offers criticism of this bill or points out some of the difficulties involved the aims of the bill are always given as the answer <e> <s> one might ask how a particular aspect will work and the answer is always our aim is such and such and that it is broad and balanced <e> <s> that still does not get over the difficulties which some children will meet <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that our unease on the issue arises from a fear of what might happen under a different government <e> <s> the many franchises that have been given to the secretary of state in the bill form part of the cause of our unease <e> <s> therefore as the government seem unwilling to move on the amendment i feel that this is an occasion when i must divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene for a moment to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish only to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an airing of the problem but i am afraid it has been rather disappointing as is so often the case <e> <s> however i should like to take the opportunity to comment on one or two of the contributions from noble lords for which i thank them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to express my support for the amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady faithfull used the word sanctuary in connection with a child who is emotionally and behaviourally disturbed <e> <s> this is one example of a child presenting special educational needs who may need extra space <e> <s> not long ago i went to a school in east london this is really in the form of an anecdote where there was a little boy who had suffered abuse at home because both of his parents had been similarly abused in their turn <e> <s> the child was a source of considerable disruption in the school <e> <s> indeed the only way that the head teacher could help the situation was by withdrawing the child from classes for one hour during the day <e> <s> however the only place where the child could go was the head teachers study and sitting room <e> <s> the head teacher had to look after him and remove him from attendance at classes for a certain period each day to enable him to calm down and get through the day <e> <s> this is the kind of difficulty that schools and head teachers have to face and the sort of thing that we must be aware of <e> <s> if the child had had somewhere to go other than the head teachers room and if a teacher had been available to look after his needs it would have been much easier and would have allowed the other children in the school to make better progress and have orderly classes <e> <s> this is just typical of the kind of difficulty that there is and i think that the amendment would help to resolve this kind of situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak briefly about the psychological service and the peripatetic teaching <e> <s> at the outset i think i should clear up a slight confusion that has arisen <e> <s> i believe that we are talking about schools under local financial management and not opted-out schools or are we not <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether the situation with the opted-out schools and grant-maintained schools is the same <e> <s> i think it is not <e> <s> anyhow at the moment we are talking about schools under local financial management <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support to this amendment <e> <s> i believe that one must bear in mind that a majority of the parents whose children attend a particular school are concerned about the standard of that school <e> <s> so are the majority of the parents whose children will go to the school <e> <s> one must bear in mind that only a small minority of parents are public spirited enough to have any concern about a school where their children are not being educated or are not going to be educated <e> <s> we are speaking here of parents with the highest possible interest and concern <e> <s> i certainly believe that some sort of consultation should be provided for <e> <s> i strongly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is also a social element in the matter <e> <s> white middle-class children are much more likely to have two parents together than for example the child of an afro-caribbean family where there may be only one parent <e> <s> i think that that element is a most important one <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my general support to these amendments really on the ground that when one hears of funds becoming available and money being proposed my heart bleeds to think that it is not to be used on the system as it is <e> <s> many schools in the country are desperate for money indeed i sometimes feel that if the education service could have been left alone but properly funded a great deal of this bill would have been unnecessary <e> <s> that to my mind is what is needed not new ideas not a gimmick a minute but the proper funding of what already exists <e> <s> i wish to offer the support of our benches to these amendments in general <e>", "<cs> my lords i echo the words of the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> the governing body is the only authority mentioned in the amendment <e> <s> i cannot understand how a governing body can know which children should be entered for which examination <e> <s> teachers notably head teachers are not mentioned in the amendment <e> <s> what is the governments thinking on these lines <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear the ministers comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to add my support for the amendments <e> <s> i consider that adult education can be a life-saving service for people who are elderly for people who have missed out on their schooling as mentioned by the noble baroness lady blackstone and indeed for the lonely <e> <s> i have had heart-rendering <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the information which he has given to the house <e> <s> i hoped that something of this nature might be in the wind <e> <s> i am very pleased to hear that a working party has been set up to look into the matter and will listen to the views of all those involved including the governors who thought up the idea of forming a trust <e> <s> we must hope that the party will produce the right and the most sensible solution whereby such schools can continue to exist and carry on with their most important work <e> <s> in the circumstances i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i express my support for this amendment partly because it would remove one element of prescription by the secretary of state and we have so many <e> <s> it would remove one prescription which seems to me quite unnecessary and undesirable for the reasons already outlined by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this amendment <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord peston that with regard to the core subjects the three rs and science a high degree of prescription is appropriate <e> <s> it may be that in a few years time if we have this there will be less general semi-literacy in the country which is one of the problems worrying the government <e> <s> with regard to the other foundation subjects i am still worried about the compatibility between what is said here and what was said in <e> <s> i laboured this point at an earlier stage of the bill <e> <s> i will not take longer than i have to now <e> <s> at the earlier stage it could have been four oclock in the morning but i cannot remember <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a recurrent fear that the national curriculum will absorb all the time in the timetable and for a particular reason <e> <s> governing bodies head teachers teachers parents and children will all say and think that the only thing that matters is the national curriculum and that they cannot be bothered with anything else <e> <s> i know what children are like <e> <s> the children themselves say this especially when they get into their teens <e> <s> one must bear in mind that a schools reputation a head teachers reputation a teachers reputation and so on are all related to the results of these assessments which will take the children up to the age of <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add from these benches our pleasure and delight that these long debates have resulted in a decision which is worthy of your lordships house <e> <s> i cannot praise it more highly than by saying that <e> <s> nevertheless i hope that the noble lord on the woolsack will call my amendment no <e> <s> when he comes to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for having explained the point <e> <s> i am relieved to hear that the law cannot command the impossible <e> <s> i have been told that before but i am glad to hear it from her lips <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support what has been said the noble lords lord morton of shuna and lord goodman concerning the matter of days <e> <s> the process is a drastic one <e> <s> for a school to opt out of local authority control is to undermine the principles of the act <e> <s> it is also irreversible <e> <s> in those circumstances it should be a difficult decision and not one which it is too easy for parents to make <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is widespread bewilderment among teachers of children with special educational needs as to how testing and assessment of their progress can at the same time be standardised and adapted to their <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that an innovative and imaginative examination has been seriously hampered by poor resourcing in books and materials <e> <s> is he aware that teachers who have a very heavy workload in administering the examination are in need of ancillary help for such services as printing photocopying and clerical work <e> <s> this is a great need for future years <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank the minister for his clear annunciation of the proposals in the education support grants regulations for the coming year <e> <s> i think that i am the only speaker so far who does not have to apologise for having been absent at the beginning of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give some assurance to the house that the working party will seriously consider that these schools should remain under one central authority <e> <s> does he agree that it is desirable for those suffering from such handicaps as autism mild or severe learning difficulties visual or hearing handicaps or emotional disturbance to be able to turn to a central repository of knowledge expertise and counselling <e> <s> does the minister also not agree that such a body could be responsible for running these schools in any future dispensation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about the importance of educating the young in the matter of the environment <e> <s> when we debated the education bill last summer certain of your lordships and i was one of them were <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell me how many of the schools that have applied for grant-maintained status are threatened by closure by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give the house any idea of the criteria used by the government in deciding eligibility for the establishment of a city college for the technology of the arts <e> <s> for example can any school in a city area where the bias is towards the creative and performing arts which necessarily involves some technology apply for that status <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add my words of gratitude to the noble lord lord stewart of fulham for introducing this very important subject and for giving us a typically wise and witty speech <e>", "<cs> my lords while at a pinch one can understand the objection to the ec directive that three languages should be taught in our schools what conceivable reason can there be for an objection to exchange visits partially funded by the lingua scheme between member countries <e>", "<cs> my lords in pursuance of the point just raised by my noble friend lord hunt is the minister aware that this is because the power of mimicry which is of paramount importance in language learning is at its peak at primary school age and later is less good <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not expecting to have to speak on this subject on which i am extremely inexpert <e> <s> however i can but raise one or two points as a lay member of the public <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i too wish to thank the minister for his exposition of the regulations <e> <s> i wish to restrain myself from any expressions of general disapprobation which i have adequately covered in preceding years <e> <s> however i wish to ask the minister a few questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support for the amendment from these benches <e> <s> the term testing has a somewhat prescriptive and authoritarian connotation and is definitely ominous in sound to the less able children for whom i always feel inclined to say a word and may well start them on their downward spiral of self-devaluation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the present situation for teachers is confused and confusing <e> <s> they are faced with assessing on a day by day basis their pupils from the age of five in different subjects against attainment targets at levels <e> <s> at the ages of seven and the children are faced with standard attainment targets as well as further assessments of which incidentally the teachers know nothing not to mention the records of achievement that are to be brought in at the age of -plus and the gcse <e> <s> does the minister not agree that this is a formidable situation for teachers <e> <s> one wonders whether there will be any time left for teaching <e> <s> what can be done to clarify and ease the position for those teachers who are faced with this situation <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that monitoring the national curriculum demands particular expert knowledge <e> <s> the education reform act itself speaks of bald and basic subjects discreetly divided with which most of us are familiar whereas tile trend of all modern teaching is towards the breakdown of subject barriers and the integration of all learning <e> <s> therefore the monitoring of the curriculum demands particular expertise <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to concentrate my remarks on the proposed scheme for student loans which was outlined in a government white paper of a year ago and even more skeletally outlined in the bill itself which appeared yesterday which tells us virtually nothing <e> <s> in doing so i shall be giving expression to my partys opposition to the scheme and to my sympathy with the students <e> <s> i have drawn heavily on some excellent research by the national union of students which has been presented to the department of education and science <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble viscount for his clear exposition of the matter that we are discussing <e> <s> i cannot give it any warmer welcome than has been given by the benches next to me <e> <s> i echo everything said by the noble baroness lady blackstone <e> <s> what worries me in particular is that weighty matters such as this are discussed in your lordships house at a time when there is a small presence the house cannot be given the opinion of a large number of your lordships and we cannot vote upon it <e> <s> these matters are weighty <e> <s> we are prolonging by a year the suspension of negotiating rights for an important <e>", "<cs> my lords i also express my appreciation of the noble viscounts exposition of the order which was clear and comprehensive <e> <s> the number of initiatives under the education support grants has grown from in to in the current year <e> <s> of course one wonders whether all of them are proving sufficiently worth while to <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not to the point that the early beginning of exams in may started with the cse and with the cse and the gce now merged into the gcse instead of having two separate exams we have only one <e> <s> therefore in theory at any rate it should not take so long to mark correct and produce the results <e> <s> is this not to the point and might it not make the examination correcting period shorter <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the question of general subjects can the minister give us any idea of what proportion of teachers in inner london are deterred from remaining in the area because they cannot afford to live there <e>", "<cs> my lords one would indeed think from listening to the minister that everything is all for the best in the best of all possible worlds <e> <s> i am afraid that i shall sound a less optimistic note in some of the things that i have to say <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister enlighten me as to how those licensed teachers will receive their training bearing in mind that to have knowledge and experience of a subject is one thing but to be able to teach it is very different especially to young people who do not wish to learn <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that a great majority if not all of the schools which have opted out of local authority control were threatened with closure and that is the main reason for their decision <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister heard as i have that in the case of the grant-maintained schools the dead hand of the local authority is replaced by the dead hand of the department of education and science <e>", "<cs> my lords i also add my appreciation to the noble baroness lady david for introducing this subject which is a very important one <e> <s> i came prepared with certain things to say on the subject of balance <e> <s> however the noble baroness has said them so well that i feel my job has been done for me <e> <s> instead i wish to say a few words about governing bodies in general and in particular to relay to your lordships two conversations which i have had during the past week with people in key positions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earls comment is amply confirmed by the lady i was speaking to who described as outrageous the idea of anyone serving at the moment on more than at most two governing bodies <e> <s> that was her word <e> <s> the permitted number is four but she considered that two is the maximum permissible in view of the new responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble earl lord baldwin on introducing the debate and on doing so with such an excellent and comprehensive survey of the present position <e> <s> i should not like any doctors to be present i am not quite sure how many are i can count two on a kind of doctor bashing occasion <e> <s> my life has been saved by the medical profession on one occasion for certain <e> <s> it has probably been saved on others too as one never knows what might have happened if one had not gone to the doctor <e> <s> nevertheless there are reasons why a large number of us consult complementary practitioners when orthodox medicine seems to have failed us <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to add my appreciation to that of other noble lords to the noble baroness lady lockwood for the committees excellent report <e> <s> it is good that we are discussing it that the government have read it and have responded to it <e> <s> also from these benches i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady brigstocke on her splendid maiden speech <e> <s> she has had vast experience and speaks with authority <e>", "<cs> my lords one school is experimenting by teaching one language one term another the next and a third language in the third term <e> <s> what happens after that i do not know <e> <s> it is very much a pilot project <e> <s> i presume they will test the reaction of the children <e>", "<cs> i too thank the minister for her exposition of the new regulations <e> <s> i am sure that the figures are what the government intend them to be and i understand that the scheme is thriving <e> <s> i have no doubt that the pupils the parents and the school are happy about the scheme <e> <s> the schools are having some nice bright pupils whom they would not otherwise have <e> <s> they are also getting an egalitarian image which must please them <e>", "<cs> my lords when the education school teachers pay and conditions order was debated on th june of this year the noble baroness said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my words of congratulation to those of the three maiden speakers whom i heard <e> <s> unfortunately i did not hear the third the noble baroness lady eccles <e> <s> however i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord pearson of rannoch and the noble earl lord howe particularly because i happen to agree with what they said which i did not expect to do as they are on the opposite side of the house <e> <s> i have the impression that nobody wants to stay unduly long <e> <s> noble lords are probably becoming thirsty and hungry <e> <s> i have been shedding sheets from my speech at a fast rate <e> <s> but there are certain matters of great importance that i should like to mention and i hope that noble lords will bear with me <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to thank the minister for her clear exposition of the changes which have been made <e> <s> we notice that the esg and local education authority training grant schemes are to be run in parallel <e> <s> i must echo what the noble baroness lady blackstone said <e> <s> i believe that the local education authorities are concerned that they have lost the flexibility which they had when the training grant schemes were open to them for suggestion and they could work out their own projects submit them for approval and go ahead with them <e> <s> they are now confined to specific projects <e> <s> that does not permit a local initiative <e> <s> if we approve the existing scheme whereby education is delivered by local authorities then they should not have their opportunities for initiative reduced in that way by central authority <e>"]
