["<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord trefgarne sits down there is one small point that i should like to raise with him in a friendly manner <e> <s> will he kindly refrain from verbal shorthand <e> <s> i have had anxious inquiries regarding the mmc <e> <s> i have given the right information but many noble lords may not understand what those initials mean <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord rather implied that my amendment no <e> <s> is on the same point as amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in point of fact it is not <e> <s> later on i shall speak about representations being made to the director about possible investigations that he might make on behalf of consumers <e> <s> i shall deal with that point later <e> <s> it has nothing whatever to do with the point with which i agree made by the noble baroness lady seear and the noble lord lord airedale <e>", "<cs> my lords i am going to disappoint the noble lord because in point of fact i cannot see why on earth the government cannot accept this small amendment <e> <s> he may say quite rightly that the director general has powers to receive representations but it is not in this bill <e> <s> if i remember correctly it is under the fair trading act <e> <s> therefore if it is not in this bill and the government need to reassure the public generally as well as the people affected by any possible change and those who wish to make representations about anti-competitive practices then the government in all decency should put it in the bill <e> <s> i do not understand why the government will not accept the amendment <e> <s> up to this stage in debating the bill we have had nothing but a stonewalling defence from them <e> <s> noble lords on the front bench opposite would make excellent boycotts in cricket in stonewalling against the bowling <e>", "<cs> my lords for the very simple reason to put it in vulgar terms it aint in the bill <e> <s> people must have clear rights in legislation of this sort which affects the consumer and producer <e> <s> it is not in the bill and the minister must now admit it is not so why not insert it <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going back to what the noble lord lord trefgarne said in committee and he said it was in the fair trading act <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot accept that position <e> <s> if it is not in any other act and we can quarrel about that later and it certainly was said then it should be in this bill <e> <s> there is no argument about that and the government should not be afraid of creating a small precedent <e> <s> if the government will not give way on this i must force a division <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble baroness in the amendment that she has moved <e> <s> so far in this bill there has been very little chance for the consumer to get much of a look in <e> <s> this is an ideal opportunity for the government to express their support for the consumer organisations which do as i think noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a brief remark on this <e> <s> at the third reading in another place the minister said that the secretary of state would have no responsibility for prices that that would be the responsibility of the respective ministers whoever they might be <e> <s> do i understand the position to be that in fact the government and the secretary of state in particular take no responsibility for prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to delay the house on this <e> <s> i think that the noble viscount has made a mountain out of a molehill by implying that this is a back-door method of introducing price control <e> <s> it is nothing of the sort <e> <s> what i and many people object to is the way in which the clause is worded so that as my noble friend lord ponsonby has just said nothing would be done <e> <s> it is said that it would be a question of receiving masses of minor complaints <e> <s> i do not think that that would be the case <e> <s> anyway why not let people make complaints <e> <s> are they going to regard the british public as a lot of dull sitting ducks to do as they are told <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble viscount refers to the secretary of states initiatives the blunt fact is that there is practically no initiative afforded to him at all except in the most remote and extreme cases <e> <s> this is an important issue <e> <s> at committee stage i moved a much stronger amendment which i have deliberately watered down this time in order to get some result out of the government but the fact is that on this bill the government do not intend to accept any amendments whatever except perhaps those that come from certain sections behind them <e> <s> that is true <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of order <e> <s> i am stating a blunt fact <e> <s> i do not want to provoke the same atmosphere that i did before <e> <s> i restrained myself praying that the charitable minds of the noble <e>"]
