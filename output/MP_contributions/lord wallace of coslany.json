["<cs> my lords may i congratulate the noble viscount lord trenchard on his first appearance at the dispatch box and sympathise with him in the problem of mastering briefs <e> <s> is he aware that the

noble earl also went on to give us very important views on the training for the new technical skills <e> <s> i welcome these remarks and would say that we also welcome the continued co-operation of managements and trade unions in this field it is vital to britains future of training for skills <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the house is indebted to the noble lord lord spens for the excellent speech he has made <e> <s> in many respects i would agree with him except that i cannot accept his somewhat sombre approach to the problems of the future <e> <s> i think what this country needs and what every man and woman in it needs is faith faith in themselves and faith in their country <e> <s> i certainly cannot accept his back to the kitchen sink approach so far as the women are concerned

research into the industry is to be welcomed <e> <s> while not opposing the order i should like to raise one or two small points <e> <s> this is an amending order on the levy aspect only and so i understand that all other provisions of the order remain in force including article containing penalty provisions of a fine of not more than per day for failure to make returns <e> <s> i should like to know if possible how many convictions have been secured since and whether it is really necessary today for this penal provision to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that so much

another question i should like to put <e> <s> i came across it by sheer accident but it is an interesting and important point <e> <s> why is it that the tubes and pipes division of the steel industry do not come under these regulations <e> <s> this could cause a very difficult situation for instance at corby which we know is threatened and possibly in other areas but i am not sure whether shotton

the wages bill <e> <s> if he wants an educational process why not start at no <e> <s> downing street <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my colleagues i should like to thank the noble earl for his clear explanation of this order <e> <s> any increase of allowances to hill farmers is particularly welcome bearing in mind the hard winter that they faced in late and early <e> <s> i think one must pay tribute to the toughest and hardworking section of the agricultural industry <e> <s> we have at least one hill farmer among us the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood and i think that the house will agree with me that in the nicest possible manner the noble baroness herself is tough and hardworking <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now approaching the end of a somewhat long but extremely useful debate

ante-natal care and maternity services in hospitals <e> <s> otherwise the figures will show a dramatic increase <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i thank the noble earl for his very short but very explicit explanation of this order which we on this side of the house find to be generally very welcome <e> <s> it not only protects the producer to a great extent it protects the consumer too <e> <s> i am assuming that this order will receive the approval of our lords and masters in the common market and in particular of our lords and masters in paris who seem to have certain views on british agricultural produce <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i thank the noble earl lord gowrie for his detailed explanation of both orders <e> <s> of course it is extremely convenient to deal with them together <e> <s> my position tonight is different from that of this time last year because months ago i introduced similar orders showing a per cent <e> <s> increase based on the average increase of

lord aware that his reply to the house is a load of balderdash <e> <s> is he further aware that the governments policy financial and otherwise has acted so far completely against the interests of

for membership <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that it is absolutely essential in the present economic climate that more and more food is grown at home and that the quality of bread would be improved if british wheat were included <e> <s> i ask the government to give every possible attention whether it is a question of growing in larger quantities or smaller quantities to the fact that more food should be grown at home because after all britain needs the dough <e>", "<cs> my lords having had the honour and pleasure of moving this order last year it gives me a great deal of satisfaction to learn that the order is being renewed and extended and i thank the noble earl for the clear way in which he explained it and for the gratifying fact that an additional million is being added because i believe the figure for the last period was million <e> <s> as we entirely agree with this it would be wasting the time of the house to make over-long speeches i simply say that i heartily approve of the order and wish it well <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a somewhat extensive but extremely useful debate <e> <s> my pleasant duty first of all being shall we say the last of the speakers before the big shots wind up is to congratulate the three maiden speakers lord godber of willington an old colleague in the other place and my good friends lord cledwyn and lord ross <e>

pleasant coincidence my noble friend lord cledwyn chose to make his maiden speech today <e> <s> i say that because in may in another place he supported my private members motion on consumer protection which was carried against the then conservative government <e> <s> unfortunately as it was a private members motion they said it could not be implemented <e>", "<cs> maybe my lords but the government have subsidised rail fares in the past <e> <s> school meal prices where such facilities exist will double to p and if noble lords opposite do not like what i am saying they will have to listen because i am speaking from practical experience of ordinary people who have suffered already after six months of conservative administration <e> <s> rents and rates are bound to show big increases <e> <s> i read on the tape a report that the manufactured foods association reckon that manufactured food prices will be up per cent <e> <s> next year <e> <s> for a government pledged to reduce inflation they seem to be doing their best to increase it <e>", "<cs> my lords the rent act may be looked at but the point is that in many areas council houses are not being built <e> <s> in many tory-controlled areas housing estates are <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl confirm that deliveries of milk to british households in the customary british manner will continue as rumours are again prevalent that the good old system of milk deliveries to the doorstep is likely to be in jeopardy <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble viscount lord long for the very detailed and lengthy explanation that he has given <e> <s> may i also express gratification that the dropped stitches have been picked up and that at last we are able to deal with this order only just in the nick of time

the whole house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mottistone robbed me of a little personal pleasure in that he robbed me of the opportunity of following the noble baroness lady hornsby-smith

forgive me for interrupting but did the noble lord say that the government inherited a rate of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord admit that the large number of cigarettes now smoked by women is the result of the economic strain placed upon them by the governments policies <e>", "<cs> we strongly object to this clause <e> <s> the clause itself is a formality to put into effect what has in the main already been carried out <e> <s> no mention was made during the general election or in the gracious speech of a conservative decision to abolish the price <e>", "<cs> there has been an undoubted deterrent effect <e> <s> in some cases prices were held without an increase being made and in some cases price increases were postponed <e> <s> all of those added up to a position where

fair to claim that until last winter when the dam broke there was restraint and that had some effect on the inflation issue <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised of course <e> <s> i did not expect generosity immediately to arise from the opposite benches <e> <s> if i understood him correctly the noble lord did say that the government are reviewing the situation with a view to amendment of the fair trading act <e> <s> that to some extent is satisfactory but why it cannot be in this bill because it is in the fair trading act i fail to see <e> <s> again if i remember correctly what the noble lord said it

just shows how weak the bill is <e> <s> in the circumstances i am not going to press the amendment at the moment <e> <s> i give it for thought to the government because i think that i have a fair point but we must press on until the early hours of tomorrow i suppose <e> <s> i shall have to leave it there for the moment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> all i can say is

stage at report rather than forcing a division and ruling out something which is giving concern to a number of members of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am astonished <e> <s> my relations with the noble lord outside this chamber are quite friendly but really and truly he is spitting in the face of the housewife and that is dangerous <e> <s> here am i on the opposition benches humbly trying for the

hiding behind the skirts of the director-general if i may use that term <e> <s> the noble lord smiles <e>", "<cs> why should there not be a director general with skirts <e>", "<cs> i will not comment

already in the bill but where is it <e> <s> the government have to give an outward appearance to the public that they can make representations <e> <s> i will ask the noble lord another question <e>

prices <e> <s> it would leave the responsibility of ministers and the responsibility of their department undefined <e>", "<cs> so why not put it in the bill <e> <s> if noble lords shout hear hear <e>

and celebrate but i had better not do so <e>", "<cs> that is quite a surprise <e> <s> am i to understand from the noble viscounts remarks that in future the nationalised industries will deal with their own prices and that there will be no government intervention whatever <e> <s> that ministers may be responsible for the financial contributions of the government towards such industries but they will have nothing to do with prices which are a very important matter <e> <s> that it is for an industry itself to set its prices so long as it makes a reasonable profit <e>", "<cs> i am still a little baffled because i think the minister has said that if the efficiency and the costs of an industry are right then the price is bound to be right <e> <s> if it is not <e>", "<cs> the financial limits of government interference <e> <s> i cannot understand how the government instructed the gas board to put up the price of gas on the basis of what the minister has said <e> <s> we are assuming in this argument that prices must he right but what will happen if even in the judgment of the secretary of state or the minister concerned with the industry they are not <e> <s> will the minister tell them that they are naughty boys and then let them get away with it or what will happen <e>", "<cs> i am still not satisfied <e> <s> it seems to me that we are now reaching the stage where the government do not want to have anything to do with prices <e> <s> i am not happy about the reply of the minister and we may give further consideration to this issue at report stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i did <e>", "<cs> tempers are getting a little bit frayed are they not <e>", "<cs> i am very surprised <e> <s> the noble viscount says noble lords on the opposite side know nothing about business <e> <s> i happen to have been in my career an office manager getting staff working and consoling my typists when the management came in after extremely heavy lunches late in the afternoon and intended to dictate their letters <e> <s> we are the people who kept the businesses going <e> <s> the people out wining and dining for business reasons on business expenses were not those actually keeping the business going <e> <s> i resent any reference that has been made <e> <s> this amendment is nothing whatever to do with the price commission <e> <s> this amendment is just giving the secretary of state responsibility to deal with public concern <e> <s> that is what he is there for <e> <s> with all the other provisions the government are really dodging the issue <e> <s> as for artful dodgers i would not be in competition with that bunch <e> <s> they have the know-how i have not <e> <s> under the circumstances i have

fired on the report stage <e> <s> i shall bring it in again <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord state whether <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord bear in mind that if the noble earl lord kinnoull went into a cafe and bought a diminished sandwich and if he took it outside and ate it in the nearest churchyard it would be cheaper than if he ate it inside because of the imposition of the penal rate of vat at per cent <e> <s> so the extent to which a luncheon voucher is diminished in value depends entirely on whether you eat out or eat in <e> <s> it is a rather silly situation <e>", "<cs> but my lords i would point out in reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i would ask the noble lord whether he is aware that his government doubled vat and the previous government did not <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree bearing in mind the excellent maiden speech made yesterday by the noble lord lord scanlon that this is a question where we simply cannot afford any economies whatever and in fact we must have expansion <e> <s> will he undertake that when the government have received the report they will give it urgent attention and report immediately to parliament so that we can have an immediate debate <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord trefgarne sits down there is one small point that i should like to raise with him in a friendly manner <e> <s> will he kindly refrain from verbal shorthand <e> <s> i have had anxious inquiries regarding the mmc <e> <s> i have given the right information but many noble lords may not understand what those initials mean <e>",

representations being made to the director about possible investigations that he might make on behalf of consumers <e> <s> i shall deal with that point later <e> <s> it has nothing whatever to do with the point with which i agree made by the noble baroness lady seear and the noble lord lord airedale <e>", "<cs> my lords i am going to disappoint the noble lord because in point of fact i cannot see why on earth the government cannot accept this small amendment <e> <s> he may say quite rightly that the director general has powers to receive representations but it is not in this bill <e> <s> if i remember correctly it is under the fair trading act <e> <s> therefore if it is not in this bill and the government need to reassure the public generally as well as the people affected by any possible change and those who wish to make representations about anti-competitive practices then the government in all decency should put it in the bill <e> <s> i do not understand why the government will not accept the amendment <e> <s> up to this stage in debating the bill we have had nothing but a stonewalling defence from them <e> <s> noble lords on the front bench opposite would make excellent boycotts in cricket in stonewalling against the bowling <e>", "<cs> my lords for the very simple reason to put it in vulgar terms it aint in the bill <e> <s> people must have clear rights in legislation of this sort which affects the consumer and producer <e> <s> it is not in the bill and the minister must now admit it is not so why not insert it <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going back to what the noble lord lord trefgarne said in committee and he said it was in the fair trading act <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot accept that position <e> <s> if it is not in any other act and we can quarrel about that later and it certainly was said then it should be in this bill <e> <s> there is no argument about that and the government should not be afraid of creating a small precedent <e> <s>

there has been very little chance for the consumer to get much of a look in <e> <s> this is an ideal opportunity for the government to express their support for the consumer organisations which do as i think noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a brief remark on this <e> <s> at the third reading in another place the minister said that the secretary of state would have no responsibility for prices that that would be the responsibility of the respective ministers whoever they might be <e> <s> do i understand the position to be that in fact the government and the secretary of state in particular take no responsibility for prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to delay the house on this <e> <s> i think that the noble viscount has made a mountain out of a molehill by implying that this is a back-door method of introducing price control <e> <s> it is nothing of the sort <e> <s> what i and many people object to is the way in which the clause is worded so that as my noble friend lord ponsonby has just said nothing would be done <e> <s> it is said that it would be a question of receiving masses of minor complaints <e> <s> i do not think that that would be the case <e> <s> anyway why not let people make complaints <e> <s> are they going to regard the british public as a lot of dull sitting ducks to do as they are told <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble viscount refers to the secretary of states initiatives the blunt fact is that there is practically no initiative afforded to him at all except in the most remote and extreme cases <e> <s> this is an important issue <e> <s> at committee stage i moved a much stronger amendment which i have deliberately watered down this time in order to get some result out of the government but the fact is that on this bill the government do not intend to accept any amendments whatever except perhaps those that come from certain sections behind them <e> <s> that is true <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of order

i have a sad duty to perform because i have to scatter a handful of earth on the coffin of price control <e> <s> the bill not only abolishes the price commission but effectively removes from the secretary of state and the government any responsibility for price control <e> <s> only under extreme conditions can the secretary of state give directions for a price increase to be investigated <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the radio society of great britain representing radio amateurs considered the results in their field as very satisfactory <e> <s> is he further aware that the society is indebted to the home office delegation for their advice and co-operation <e> <s> the home office team is indeed to be congratulated on its efficient and effective work which deserves the highest praise <e>", "<cs> my lords for my part i have some considerable doubts about this bill and cynically enough i feel that st april is an appropriate day for us to discuss it <e>

hangars naafi canteens and elsewhere <e> <s> here was a challenge something which offered a bright new dawn for all the darkness and danger and fear of the war years <e> <s> time passed and on th february i made my maiden speech on the national insurance bill speaking from the last bench but one now behind me in this chamber <e> <s> it was an emotional moment the establishment of the welfare

increases since then <e> <s> it is well below the full cost of even a simple funeral <e> <s> both labour and tory ministers have argued over the years that while they would like to increase the death grant they could not justify doing so in terms of spending priorities <e> <s> but that is not an argument for letting the value of the grant decline indefinitely <e> <s> at a time when the government have just announced proposals to save millions a year on the social security budget they can hardly say that the million needed to restore the value of the death grant cannot be found <e>", "<cs> i

bills which is unfortunate <e> <s> having registered our displeasure we will leave our displeasure on the record until a later date <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>",

committee stage of this bill is slowly petering out and that this is the governments chance to redeem themselves from their back to the wall approach to every conceivable amendment which has come before them <e> <s> if there is any amendment which needs support and which should receive support from the government it is this <e> <s> i hope that rising to express support from these benches will not result in what has been my experience so far in rising to support other peoples amendments that is the kiss of death <e>", "<cs> i really must come in to say that when the noble lord refers to enthusiasm on this side of the committee he is very much misunderstanding the situation <e> <s> we do not like it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for going into such detail in his reply <e> <s> there is still confusion over this <e> <s> in my view a weekly paid person is better off than a monthly paid person when starting a job because he has not got to wait so long for his money that is obvious <e> <s> i accept that many employers transferring weekly paid workers to monthly pay do in fact help them out there is no doubt about that <e> <s> but as i said at committee stage when you come to a point where a worker is unemployed and then gets an engagement with an employer who pays on a monthly basis that man is in a worse position because he has to wait a month for his money <e> <s> furthermore as i said then and i still believe no employer could be expected to help unless he was an extremely generous charitable person because how is he to know that that employee is going to be satisfactory <e> <s> he may have to dismiss him at the end of the month <e> <s> so there is a need for some assistance to the monthly paid <e> <s> i do not intend to press the amendment now <e> <s> i think there is a little disagreement here but i would not regard it as a serious disagreement <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it is not just a question of football crowds and so on but is very often a question of youths drinking in public houses and then coming outside late at night and attacking civilians <e> <s> at albany park bexley on the line which i use there is no guarantee that anybody travelling late at night on the dartford loop will not suffer physical violence <e> <s> we are facing a national problem <e> <s> i think that all parties must get down to it and find a way out by occupying the youths or imposing severer penalties <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say a few words but i am sorry to say not very kind words about the bill <e> <s> the bill in the main deals with a most sensitive area of social security namely the poverty trap <e> <s> but without a word of exaggeration in my view and in the view of many other people it is a most insensitive bill <e> <s> the noble baroness lady young who certainly did a very good job for a government on those benches not always i suspect lacking sympathy for the amendments moved said tonight that the keynote of the bill was simplification <e> <s> i cannot accept that <e> <s> how can a bill bring in a simplified system when we are bringing in a whole series of complicated and lengthy regulations about which unless we get some guarantee the general public and those people helping the underprivileged will not have an opportunity of obtaining adequate information unless the government move quickly to provide the information that my noble friend lord wells-pestell has requested <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all may i thank the noble lord lord lyell for his very clear explanation particularly in the earlier stages of his speech <e> <s> i welcome the order as far as it goes but it is not far enough <e> <s> in my view the order is too modest by far <e> <s> the danger from smouldering cigarettes on foam-filled furniture is slight compared with the danger of the deadly gas given off by such furniture in a fire such as took place at woolworths manchester some months ago <e> <s> the causes of fires are varied <e> <s> apart from careless use of lighted cigarettes electrical faults lighted matches and sparks from fire grates are some examples <e> <s> i doubt whether a warning against careless use of lighted cigarettes in itself is sufficient <e> <s> what is needed my lords is adequate fireproofing of covering material and the banning of the use of polyurethane and reversion to the use of flock felt <e> <s> this latter i admit would have unfavourable repercussions on furniture prices and may therefore not be practical <e> <s> it would certainly be un economic <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did not reply to my suggestion about supplies of fire proof loose coverings i think that is the technical expression used by the housewives for furniture already in the possession of people in their homes <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had quite an excellent debate although the number of speakers is comparatively small <e> <s> i have made some calculations based upon the speeches which have been made and i have come to the conclusion that this is a most unpopular bill <e> <s> there were four speeches in favour and seven against <e> <s> i only hope that at the committee stage there will be a similar reflection when it comes to some of the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords there is also this point to bear in mind that these days in point of fact many railway stations are not manned at night due mainly to vandalism and is the noble lord aware that many people walk through stations with tickets in their hands which have not been clipped because at charing cross and other stations they do not clip them anyway <e>", "<cs> it seems from the remarks just made that the consciences of a number of noble lords have been touched <e> <s> i fully appreciate the effects of inflation <e> <s> the noble lord lord drumalbyn was perfectly right in his reference to inflation <e> <s> i can say that after having this weekend paid just under p for a large loaf which means virtually a shilling loaf which is quite a consideration for the average family <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble viscount lord ingleby for his intervention because we have at least had the remarks of one person who knows what it is all about <e> <s> i will not go into any great detail because the noble lord lord banks has made his case and i would not presume to encroach on the field of an acknowledged expert <e> <s> i think that the noble lord can be and is regarded in this house as an expert on this particular matter <e>", "<cs> no doubt noble lords in all parts of the committee have received representations on clause as a whole from various people of repute various organisations dealing with the sick the mentally sick and the training of young people <e> <s> i understand and this may be subject to the minister giving us some confirmation that the government have given an undertaking that they will monitor the effects of changing the linking rule and that if there prove to be problems the period can be changed again through the use of regulations <e> <s> it is not very clear what form this monitoring exercise will take or how it will be possible to estimate the number of people deterred from seeking work who might otherwise have done so <e> <s> both commonsense and the experience of those concerned with rehabilitation suggest that the change will have a disincentive effect <e> <s> we believe that the government should retain the present linking period unless and until it is established that the change will have no damaging consequences <e>", "<cs> in proposing to your lordships that we do not accept clause i would make an appeal to the front bench on the government side

do not think they are very good at doing it but at least we know where they stand they are going to rob the poor to give it to the rich <e>", "<cs> i am on the point of doing so <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord byers <e> <s> the point to which the noble lord lord byers has <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the noble lord lord byers <e> <s> he has outlined and made a cast iron-case <e> <s> the amendment would avoid an obvious injustice <e> <s> i think that this is a situation where the government can come forward and meet this side of the committee in an attempt at last to reach a stage where an amendment will he accepted which would of course be revolutionary <e> <s> but please do not mention anything more about financial savings <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady young said this was not a bill designed to deal with abuse <e> <s> why then did she say on second reading <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness agree that the figure would probably be about million per annum <e>", "<cs> the figure i mentioned actually appeared in an early day motion in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords first i wish to thank the noble baroness lady young for the rather quick but quite clear manner in which she presented the details of a bill which is in fact far more complicated than she suggested <e> <s> i appreciate what the noble baroness said about her having another engagement indeed the house appreciates the extreme pressure to which the noble baroness is subject in her ministerial office <e> <s> what amazes me and i am

speech of the noble baroness lady mcfarlane of llandaff and to hearing what she has to say on this vital subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i should thank the noble baroness for that detailed explanation

guarantee whatever that there will not be further abatements <e> <s> we feel this is quite unjust and that to continue abatements in this field is not acceptable and therefore should not be continued <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has brought me into the picture <e> <s> my argument is that we should not even be considering this amendment <e> <s> the government should not have done what they now propose <e> <s> another point i should like to make to the noble baroness is that this section of the community is already being hit by local government cuts involving the personal social

misbegotten idea were got rid of <e> <s> many people upon realising the facts would feel most apprehensive but the general public do not know the situation <e> <s> what the government are proposing

power of money in this country <e> <s> we all know that this year we can buy less as against last year simply because of rising prices and the drop in the purchasing value of the pound <e> <s> this is a factor that ought to be taken into account <e> <s> it affects these people <e> <s> with increases in costs and so on this is going to be further reduced by the time next year is reached <e> <s> the noble lord sees what i am getting at <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not disappointed me <e> <s> i am getting absolutely punch drunk with the repeated statements of the government <e> <s> this

blunder on <e> <s> this is an important matter <e> <s> i do not think we should part with it readily <e> <s> i do not intend to divide the house on it because it is not a matter on which there would

i speak as a house of lords man and certainly in no narrow party political sense whatever <e> <s> i want the house to understand that clearly whatever else it may decide <e>", "<cs> my lords it was included in the select committee report and in point of fact it was taken into account <e> <s> the select committee did take it into account although it is not yet law and on the statue book <e> <s>

from the noble lord lord drumalbyn <e> <s> considerable time was taken in hearing the evidence including the evidence against by representatives of the secretary of state for the environment and the committee reached a conclusion after extremely careful consideration which should be supported by this house on whose behalf the committee acted <e>", "<cs> following on lady phillipss remarks about areas and having a name to cover a whole series of services i would put a point to the noble baroness for the government to consider <e> <s> i am not here to put forward any political criticism at all

officer and another <e> <s> it is not a pleasant task and i am thankful that i am not involved this time as i was last time <e> <s> i do not agree with the noble baroness lady robson when she says that there will be practically no redundancy <e> <s> i do not speak from the regional health authority angle but from the area health authority angle in as much as i was a member of an area health authority for some time <e> <s> in the present set-up and some noble lords will appreciate this point there is almost a complete duplication from top to bottom of the area health authority staff and the district authority staff <e> <s> that is one of my objections to it <e> <s> if one takes that into account even allowing for wastage there is bound to be considerable redundancy <e> <s> i am not prepared to put a figure on it <e> <s> nobody can <e> <s> but i would forecast a far higher figure than any of those already given <e> <s> this is inevitable due to the structure of the service at the

also and this is very important urgently needed equipment <e> <s> because of the financial limits imposed upon health authorities they are not permitted to spend money on such equipment at this time <e> <s> why encourage health authorities to engage in efforts to raise additional finance when let us face it their major duty is to ensure the efficient administration of the health service <e> <s> this work is being carried on by voluntary effort at no cost to the health service <e> <s> therefore i repeat why engage officers and it may be quite a number in fund-raising efforts when their primary duty and obligation to the health service is to see that it is managed efficiently <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e> <s> what i said was that vague assurances had been given in another place

i do not want to be involved with it <e> <s> i was just pointing out that in another place the minister gave great assurances which i am sure will upset some members although they will not upset me

welfare state over many years we fought for it and eventually saw its arrival after the second world war <e> <s> make no mistake about it my lords this bill is a major erosion in the welfare state <e>

i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for his answer may i ask him whether he is aware that with inadequate provision of the service patients quickly become dependent on other health service disciplines at an additional cost financially to the state and even worse an increase in human discomfort and

will seek power for health authorities to run major lotteries the noble lord has said so <e> <s> i am very concerned about this <e> <s> under those circumstances on the question of principle i shall press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the question suggests that the best recruiting sergeant for the armed forces will be major unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too

met <e> <s> true differences of opinion still exist but that is expected in a true democracy such as ours <e> <s> i would go further and so far as clause i is concerned congratulate the government on realising the major error in a previous conservative governments reorganisation and acting so promptly to put matters right <e> <s> i only wish that the government had the same courage to put right

reduction this time <e> <s> i think that the noble lord is completely wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to remember what i said for i passed my notes to <e>", "<cs> i ought to try to put the noble earl out of his misery because with all due respect to him he has waffled but with his usual charm <e> <s> i cannot give him greater praise than that <e>", "<cs> the noble earl was skirting

the new legislation and in the meantime put this in suspense instead of putting <e>", "<cs> i must explain that the work i did in malta was on another set of more complicated amendments that the noble lord lord bellwin will be dealing with later on <e>", "<cs> at least i cannot say that i am surprised but what did surprise me was what was said by the noble lord lord sandford who is president of the association of district councils <e> <s> he said that he did not think the amendment would get through in another place simply because it is not contained in the title of the bill <e> <s> in fact it is possible to amend the long title and that is precisely what i have done <e> <s> later in the marshalled list noble lords will find that there is an amendment to that effect <e> <s> i believe that

more democratic <e>", "<cs> i was rather afraid of that and normally i would be upset but we have had a good debate the point has been made and i hope that it will receive due publicity <e> <s> to say that the majority of local authorities are against it is absolutely untrue <e> <s> the county councils are against it but i have had innumerable letters no doubt other noble lords have had similar

regarding savings include taking into account the compensation that will be payable to a considerable number of highly paid officers possibly among the -odd that he mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that it is rather strange to hear his statement about the efficiency of services in the south-east being increased when a considerable number of stations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that anybody buying spectacles off the peg is being utterly foolish because in so doing he can ruin his eyesight instead of improving it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that she made a statement during the proceedings on the bill that the circular giving the general outlines of the governments intentions would be readily available to members <e> <s> is she further aware that i personally was not aware of the issue of the circular until i received a letter from the national council for voluntary organisations and further that it took two telephone calls and delay of a week before i received a copy which was sent to me by special messenger <e> <s> the other point is that i am involved with the league of friends as president and there are many other active voluntary organisations and the government have said at all stages that the activities envisaged in the bill would be of a comparatively minor character <e> <s> how does this line up with something that was not stated at any stage that there would be interest-free loans from the government to help authorities and secondly the use of professional organisers all of which indicates large-scale efforts when at the moment charity is doing a considerable amount of work and making efforts which are to the benefit of the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness now give an assurance to the house that there will be full consultation with charitable organisations <e> <s> it is only at a very late stage that this has happened and there are still serious objections <e> <s> there should have been consultation but this happened only at the very last moment and there are still serious doubts about the effect of the governments proposals on the activities of charitable organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that there is some feeling in the forces <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from the question of high interest rates is the noble earl aware that small businesses would benefit considerably from simplification of vat so

as local government rates are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble earl lord gowrie for his clear if somewhat brief explanation of the bills provisions <e> <s> i must say that speaking from these benches it makes our job extremely difficult to deal with this bill when in point of fact we are getting a statement shortly afterwards and probably as i sit down <e> <s>

possession of the same facilities as the government front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the comment of my noble friend about the mobility of the forces may i ask the noble viscount to agree that it would be a good idea to advise members of the forces especially those nearing retirement at least to register themselves with their appropriate local authority because they all have roots

hour <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only quoting the statement made in the programme the oxford road show <e> <s> i do not recommend it it is mainly pop stuff and really my mind does not go as far as that

quoted oxfordshire and hampshire <e> <s> i can only quote what they said and that is the position so far as i know <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the very important debate last night on the unstarred question on the after-care of the mentally sick will the noble lord and the government draw the attention of local authorities to the fact that some of these properties would be a godsend in providing accommodation for those needing after-care <e> <s> i understand that some could be accommodated <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what happens to the rent book <e> <s> as the noble lord is

to find that the department do not have detailed information available on this very vital matter <e> <s> furthermore the noble lord said that the patient must come first <e> <s> is it not the position that the patient comes first if adequate nursing care is available and that many consultants and patients depend on the nurses <e> <s> is it not a fact that unless we provide adequate accommodation

reassured <e>", "<cs> my lords first i wish to congratulate my noble friend lord plant on his speech and on his presentation of the bill in your lordships house <e> <s> naturally enough i also wish to congratulate my honourable friend mr nigel spearing on bringing forward the bill <e> <s> i wish to welcome the bill on behalf of these benches <e> <s> although the bill is merely permissive it gives

need for handrails <e> <s> i have personal experience in this matter though the lady concerned will kill me if i mention her by name <e> <s> there is a need in her case for a handrail and i had to fix one on part of our stairs on her release from hospital <e> <s> i fixed the handrail in far better fashion than i normally would <e> <s> unfortunately having covered it with its first coat of paint i stepped back to admire my work and kicked a tin of paint down the stairs covering both the walls and the stairs <e> <s> consequently i was then closer to tears than i had been all my life <e> <s>

it is correct to say object <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord lyell for that clear explanation of the order he has cast a great deal of light on the subject <e> <s> i obtained a copy of the order last weekend and read it <e> <s> utterly confused i read it again and again and each time the situation became worse <e> <s> then i got copies of the acts referred to

am grateful therefore to the noble lord for clarifying what i must call a certain amount of gobbledygook <e> <s> i believe the order is justified fair and reasonable and i have no objections to it <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be better and save the time of the house if your lordships were to give speedy consideration to the bill which stands in the name of the noble baroness lady masham of ilton and get it through since that would avoid a lot of questions <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say when this matter will be discussed by the house <e> <s> so far as i am aware all we have had is a written answer in another place <e> <s> can he indicate what regulations will be placed before the house for full discussion and decision before the citizens band is in fact introduced <e>",

committee stage <e> <s> i am very keen about it and i hope that the house will do something about it in due course <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment for the moment <e>", "<cs> frankly that was a shocking answer for the minister to give <e> <s> the government admit the whole position and the noble lord agreed that the financial involvement was not great <e> <s> he said it would involve a few more civil servants <e> <s> the government have a considerable number checking on scroungers <e> <s> why not in all sincerity put a few on the task of putting right what the government themselves

argument the government can advance against the amendment <e> <s> they say all will be put right at some time in the future but meantime the deserving people suffer <e> <s> i cannot accept the governments attitude and must divide the committee <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble baroness for what she has said and for the information that she has given the committee <e> <s> this is a very interesting point and quite frankly i tabled the new clause simply to obtain information for myself and for the rest of the committee <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble baroness and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many elderly people are suffering acute anxiety over the problem of funeral costs <e> <s> the approach of these old people is the need to be decently buried and one can understand that <e> <s> many of them because of their age have fully paid up policies but could not afford even if it were possible to reinsure <e>

noble baroness for that reply my lords because it will give a deal of comfort to a large number of people <e> <s> bearing in mind the urgency of the matter raised in the main question may i ask the noble baroness to urge on the government the necessity of speeding up a decision on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord reconsider the question put by my noble friend <e> <s> if my noble friend had inserted the word long-term then maybe the government would do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord lord renton for what he has said <e> <s> i hope that i have not spoilt his question <e> <s> i hope that he receives a very favourable answer and i can assure him of my very warm support in all that he does in that field <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that we are discussing a very complicated and involved matter <e> <s> would it not be advisable i offer this suggestion to set up a select committee to investigate the whole matter with a view to simplification and consolidation of the law involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that apart from the case of mrs tissier reported in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that remark but is she aware that one of the ideals held by those of us involved in the provision of a national health service was the parable of the good samaritan which now seems to be being abandoned <e> <s> further in view of the fact that the government are considering imposing charges on people from abroad would they now drop these proposals which are causing so much irritation

bunch of people and i do not blame them in their attempts to get something done <e> <s> there is something unique about this bill it went through the other place and all the other stages without any comment but your lordships have not only had to debate the bill but have also had to insert major amendments with government assistance <e> <s> it is now going back to the other place <e> <s> there is a degree of risk which is worrying me <e> <s> i have given my views to the noble baroness because i know what the commons can be like so far as time is concerned <e> <s> the noble baroness and her friends have one great asset on their side and that is the governments willingness so obviously displayed to see this bill through <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned the medical authorities with whom there will be consultation on this particular matter <e> <s> will they include the royal college of midwives <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the governments policy of increasing prescription charges so frequently and at such a very high level at the moment is imposing considerable hardship particularly upon people who need to have more than one drug <e> <s> this is something i hope the government will reconsider <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that that is no excuse for underpaying nurses who are indeed underpaid at the present time and is he aware that the nurses have decided by a majority decision not to become involved in industrial action which is a tribute to their profession <e> <s> secondly is the noble lord aware that so far as nursing levels in hospitals are concerned it is time that someone got rid of the absurd system whereby hospital nursing levels are judged bybeddage a term that i utterly detest <e> <s> thirdly and i am sorry to put all these questions to the noble lord is he aware that there is in fact a very serious shortage of nursing tutors and that it is no good recruiting pupil and student nurses unless teachers are available to teach them <e>", "<cs> referring to the other amendments and bearing in mind what the noble lord lord renton said it seems to me that there are varying views about the government amendment <e> <s> if there is to be reconsideration of the matter i do not think we should give token approval to the government amendment but that the government should withdraw it temporarily <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord renton for kindly giving me the opportunity to be in order <e> <s> i had thought that the debate on the other amendment was continuing <e> <s> i was fascinated by the debate on amendments nos <e> <s> and a <e> <s> obviously there is considerable support for amendment no <e> <s> on various grounds some support for amendment no <e> <s> and marginal support for amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i feel that if there is to be a reconsideration the government could easily take back their own amendment and discuss with their officials and advisers the substance of the other two amendments <e> <s> the government could then come forward on report with a government amendment which should more or less satisfy all points that have been expressed <e> <s> i think that that would be a tidy way to deal with the matter and i am trying to save the government embarrassment which of course is a very praiseworthy effort on my part <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it is about time that we got rid of this stupid expression quango <e> <s> a lot of well-meaning and excellent voluntary workers are being classified as parasites by the government by the use of this stupid word <e> <s> secondly is the noble lord aware that the efficiency of the national health service is being undermined by the governments policy of a ridiculous allocation of money by its distribution throughout the regions and by blindly going ahead with pampering the private health service at the expense of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness give an assurance to the house that when health authorities are faced with economy cuts many of them are facing severe financial difficulties on no account will this service be cut but will be expanded <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble viscount lord long for his clear and detailed explanation of the purpose of this order <e> <s> he did so at a very impressive gallop but did brush a few fences in his progress for which i forgive him <e> <s> however i cannot agree with him that the work of the development council has decreased or is not now necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble viscount is correct <e> <s> if he will refer to the debates in <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt but am i right in thinking that we are also discussing the supplementary benefit requirements and conditions of entitlement amendment regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords from listening to the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne i had the impression of some benevolent gentleman throwing pound notes away by the million <e> <s> in point of fact the story is entirely different <e> <s> i entirely agree of course that these orders should be the subject of one debate <e> <s> with possibly one exception they are the administrative instruments of social security legislation which has passed through both houses of parliament in spite of severe criticism and the now familiar pattern of the governments rigid attitude in not accepting amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say how much of this publicly owned land is <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount give an undertaking in order that the true extent of unemployment should be shown and bearing in mind that the youth opportunities programme is temporary that when the figures of unemployment are issued there will be a supplementary list added to it of those engaged in temporary training under the youth opportunities programme <e> <s> this would give the country some idea of the extent of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that both these schemes however desirable are in fact temporary expedients and that the only worthwhile objective of the government is to ensure a situation where a young man or girl leaving school <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that in the present economic state of the country to think of either abolishing or reducing the powers of the industrial training boards is completely against the interests of the country <e> <s> this is a very serious matter <e> <s> we shall certainly monitor any replies that he may give and watch developments in the future because this is a very critical issue <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord inglewood touched on retirement and it reminded me that i retired in <e>", "<cs> i have found a new lease of life and am working harder than i ever did even when i was in the commons <e> <s> however that is beside the point <e> <s> we must get on with the debate because time is short <e> <s> the first pleasant duty that i have is to compliment and extend my sincere congratulations to the noble lord lord stodart of leaston on his maiden speech <e> <s> certainly i look forward to further contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first extend a welcome to the noble lord lord elton who is dealing i believe with his first bill on his appointment to ministerial responsibility <e> <s> the noble lord has indeed taken on a tough task in following the noble baroness lady young who set such a high standard and was a formidable opponent but nevertheless was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but there is a very important point here <e> <s> where is the money coming from <e> <s> are the local authorities to get additional grants <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the inland revenue is at least very competent and efficient in one direction as soon as the state old-age pension is raised those of us who also receive another pension receive a prompt notice some seven days before the increase which indicates an increase in our schedule and taxation <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate and particularly the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i am not too happy about the ministers reply <e> <s> there is a point of substance here <e> <s> it may be that some form of rewording might meet the case <e> <s> even if only patients are involved the risk is there <e> <s> i shall take account of what has been said today and study <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord elton for his amendments which certainly go a long way to meet the requirements of a number of us in your lordships committee <e> <s> while i am prepared to support the amendments i am not too happy about the use of the phrase impairment or severe mental impairment <e> <s> i fully appreciate the effort made to resolve a problem but the words used still appear to me to be somewhat vague <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord renton referered to the subtle use of words and i think that he is quite accurate there <e> <s> however whether that be so or otherwise what is proposed here removes an injustice from the bill and that is the main thing <e> <s> we can be worried about whether the words are subtle or otherwise but generally speaking we are prepared to support the amendments <e>", "<cs> that was not my intention <e> <s> if my amendment is accepted i do not know what will happen to lord winstanleys amendment <e> <s> i am quite sympathetic to his amendment but i am not part of the alliance so there is a problem here <e> <s> in fact i definitely refuse to be a part <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord winstanley can be of assistance <e>", "<cs> i do not want to be difficult but i think that my amendment is better than the noble lords amendment and goes much further <e> <s> i am not trying to be difficult because this is not a bill to get difficult about it is a question of co-operation <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to discuss the amendment it is all right with me but i am dealing specifically with my amendment and i will not refer to lord winstanleys amendment <e> <s> if he wishes to bring in his amendment it is a free country and he is welcome <e> <s> the committee i am sure will be pleased to hear him but not for too long of course <e> <s> he is not always a very lengthy speaker <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for intervening on that point <e> <s> what i have in mind is that the individual shall possess the information in clear and definable written terms as well as being given it verbally <e> <s> he can hand this to his next-of-kin if necessary to deal with it <e>", "<cs> why not do so <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful indeed for the debate that we have had and for the welcome approach by the minister <e> <s> it almost made me feel that it was christmas all over again <e> <s> i would explain that this -hour limit is rather important and we must bear this in mind because under the amendment of the noble lord lord winstanley as the minister has suggested a reasonable time might mean this year next year some time never <e> <s> it is so indefinite <e> <s> so far as the next-of-kin are concerned i certainly have it in mind that that would be a common-sense action on the part of all authorities receiving advice from the minister <e> <s> i would say to the noble baroness lady wootton who has now disappeared from sight that i agree that even maternity cases have rights but i never for the life of me thought that maternity cases would come under this amendment <e> <s> but even so maternity cases have rights <e>", "<cs> i fully understand what the minister says <e> <s> i have often felt the same when i have been addressing the government front bench <e> <s> i accept that if the noble lord is to move an amendment it will be embodied in the statute <e> <s> i was going to ask whether there would be a statutory duty but if the noble lord moves an amendment it will obviously be in the statute <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am rather intrigued about this <e> <s> personally i would rather support amendment no <e> <s> than the present amendment <e> <s> i am very concerned about the words inserted in the amendment of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords although i fully understand his inability to make full comment on negotiations which are proceeding does the noble lord not agree that it is time that lip-service about the value of the nursing service should be implemented by making nurses a special case <e> <s> furthermore is he aware that all consultants depend absolutely and completely on adequate nursing care and skill in order to make sure that their treatment is in fact successful <e> <s> so nurses are a special case <e> <s> will he and his government bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> first of all i think your lordships committee would like to thank the noble lord lord belstead for the detailed way in which he has put over the governments case for this amendment <e> <s> it is a very involved and detailed matter particularly the new schedule and while at this stage we welcome the governments initiative which follows the european courts decision of course it is a matter which will still need further consideration and conceivably i do not necessary say that it will be the case we might have to bring forward some possible amendment at report stage <e> <s> in the meantime taking the whole thing generally i would first of all express our thanks to the noble lord lord belstead and secondly at this stage we certainly welcome the government amendment <e>", "<cs> i would draw attention to the fact there is an amendment down in my name no <e> <s> i think a liberal amendment too which will probably deal with this particular point <e> <s> the noble baroness will doubtless support it <e>", "<cs> i am staggered <e> <s> this is my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i am an innocent <e> <s> i do not even pretend to be a barrack room lawyer <e> <s> the government have stated their position <e> <s> i hesitate to indicate my noble friends position because he is not here <e> <s> he is involved in criminal proceedings and <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i could call on various noble lords sitting on this bench but i am not going to waste the time of the committee <e>", "<cs> i think i put that right <e> <s> in spite of what the noble lord has said about the governments attitude and with all due deference to what the noble lord lord renton and my old respected opponent lady hornsby-smith have said i shall at this stage withdraw the amendment <e> <s> possibly my noble friend and upon his head be it will bring it back again at report <e>", "<cs> i would like to support the amendment from these benches <e> <s> as i indicated at second reading we look forward to a number of patients being discharged under this new act <e> <s> this will give rise to quite a number of social problems not only concerning people to look after the patients but also of accommodation <e> <s> i cited a case in norwich where there were houses which had been altered with some help from the local authority and voluntary organisations to provide accommodation with a former nurse to look after them <e> <s> this is the ideal situation <e> <s> i am sure there will be problems unless the spirit of this amendment is accepted and i would support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful indeed to all the members of your lordships committee who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> if it is a collection of voices then obviously the amendment has the support of the committee there is no doubt about that <e> <s> the minister has done his best to put a case <e> <s> he rests on the governments ability to make regulations <e> <s> that is a possbility but the point is that we want to establish firmly in this particular bill an amendment which clearly indicates the rights of mental patients to receive legal aid <e> <s> that is a vital principle <e>", "<cs> we have had a long discussion <e> <s> i must confess that having listened to the noble lord lord hooson i am inclined to think that his amendment amendment no <e> <s> is a little better because it gives some degree of protection so far as staff are concerned <e> <s> i know that some members of staff are under pressure at times and that this is causing severe embarrassment <e> <s> the minister has dropped the rather broad hint that between now and report he may think about the matter <e> <s> we are quite prepared to think about it between now and report unless amendment no <e> <s> should be accepted <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment very briefly <e> <s> it goes a little further than the amendment which was not acceptable to the government <e> <s> it involves staff and i am fully aware that staff may be concerned about the repeal in fact there is no doubt about it many of them are and that this amendment might be more acceptable as it requires screening for prosecutions <e> <s> the director has stated that apart from consideration of public policy he will not consent to any prosecutions that have less than a per cent <e> <s> chance of success <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness proceeds may i say that my amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> b of the noble lord lord winstanley are virtually the same but the noble lord and i differ from the noble baroness on a very important point of detail <e> <s> also i doubt whether the noble baroness has put her amendment in the right place <e>", "<cs> that is very clever of the minister i entirely agree with him <e>", "<cs> if it is convenient to the committee i shall now move my amendment no <e> <s> page line at end insert <e>", "<cs> it may not be necessary to move it <e> <s> the noble lord may even accept it <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether that was a favourable comment or otherwise <e> <s> neither the white paper nor the amendment bill makes any proposals as to how the mental health act commission will be monitored in the way it discharges its various responsibilities in relation to individual matters such as deciding to override a patients refusal to consent to treatment <e> <s> the independent doctor appointed by the mental health act commission is under no obligation to listen to the patients views or to give reasons for his decisions <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed with the noble lord because after all let us face it the amendment is only asking i know that i went into a great amount of detail for the commission to have regard to the interests of informal patients <e> <s> as has already been indicated it is quite possible that in the course of their duties that will happen if only accidentally <e> <s> i see no harm in the government accepting this amendment because it does not commit the commission in any shape or form so far as detail is concerned they should have some regard to the interests of informal patients that is all <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has given me a bright idea <e> <s> he has made a suggestion to me and i certainly would not ignore any suggestion that the noble lord makes <e> <s> i am quite willing in view of what he has said to put down an amendment that the mental health commission shall not disregard the interests of informal patients <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord put in an amendment to cover that because it is not laid down <e> <s> i am playing safe on this <e> <s> it is not laid down <e> <s> naturally i accept the noble lords word but it does not say so in the bill <e>", "<cs> after that i am speechless <e> <s> under the circumstances and in view of the somewhat guarded indication that i might get an amendment from the government at the report stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are reaching a very reasonable negotiating position if i may put it that way <e> <s> quite honestly i would agree with the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> throughout this bill we have had only one division which was rather unfortunate as some members could not be present <e> <s> but as far as possible i am not anxious to have divisions on this measure because in general principle it is an acceptable measure all the way round <e> <s> if we can negotiate on points of detail i am quite willing to do so <e> <s> in view of what has been said and i hope that as a result i shall be looked at in a kind light i shall withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate and i thank the minister too for his explanation of his aims and objectives at least the departments aims and objectives <e> <s> on this point concerning the small number of experienced people i think he spoke about people with years experience <e> <s> or was it the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> there are people who are qualified by experience if i can put it that way <e> <s> that is acceptable and i see not the slightest reason why these people should not be taken care of <e> <s> they can be taken as qualified by experience and that would be the end of that <e> <s> it is the other people whom i have in mind <e>", "<cs> when the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i agree <e> <s> it hit me for six right in the heart <e> <s> i do not think i need prolong this any further <e> <s> i will beg leave to withdraw the amendment and will of course consider it further <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while the figures he gave are certainly to some extent encouraging there is still a shortage of nurses in many areas <e> <s> furthermore is he aware that now in recent months training places have been reduced because of the financial restrictions imposed on health authorities and that many would-be nurses are restricted and unable to take up training for some considerable time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not referred to the training places having been reduced <e> <s> in the south-east and metropolitan areas that is certainly the case <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the governments very welcome amendments to the bill which is at present before the house will make this matter very important and urgent <e> <s> will he hear in mind that it is possible that some extensions to local hospitals as indicated by the noble lord lord winstanley could be the answer for those children who are in need of hospital care <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the hospitals which are mainly the subject of closure are in fact and no doubt he will agree with me ancient monuments that only need to be demolished <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all may i thank the noble lord lord elton for the very comprehensive statement that he has made <e> <s> i cannot say quite honestly that i welcome this statement because the statement indicates a major departure from the principle on which britains national health service was founded namely that all who fall sick within our shores should receive treatment irrespective of class colour or creed the parable of the good samaritan in practice <e> <s> speaking as one who was very much involved in the campaign to bring in the national health service in those days that was the principle that activated us in which we could set an example to the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take up one point with the noble lord <e> <s> i asked him what evidence the government had of abuse <e> <s> he replied that the evidence lies in the mail bags of members of another place <e> <s> i have been a member of another place and so has the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and many others <e> <s> we all know about the abusive and semi-charging letters that arrive as regards which no evidence can be produced <e> <s> it is sheer <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to support the amendment very strongly <e> <s> as the noble lord lord winstanley mentioned i put down an amendment during the committee stage but i was rather rash in asking for this information to be given within hours which was an error of judgment on my part <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord winstanley that it is absolutely essential that patients rights should be explained to them and that if they are unable to understand them then their nearest relative should in fact receive the information <e> <s> it does not mean that the government will be faced with innumerable court cases <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is completely and absolutely mistaken <e> <s> he is a little bit muddled <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord proceeds may i ask whether it would be convenient to the house if amendment no <e> <s> i accept that there are certain differences between the two was discussed at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> in my name and that of my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that an excellent dinner would have modified the ministers approach <e> <s> however in view of the fact that we might get our generous bonus on the next stage of the bill i will withdraw the amendment now and will have the opportunity no doubt if the noble lord the minister does not come clean to put my amendment down again <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support very strongly the noble baronesss amendment <e> <s> noble lords may recall that on second reading of the bill i brought up this point and quoted an example that i discovered in the city of norwich <e> <s> one of the difficulties the government may advance is that of financial support beset as local authorities are at the moment with instant and constant demands to reduce their expenditure <e> <s> but this expenditure is worthwhile <e> <s> in addition of course it is possible that there are voluntary agencies willing and able to co-operate <e> <s> i think if the initiative lies with the district health and local authority services they can and must call upon the voluntary services who are only too willing to give assistance <e> <s> we must remember that if the tribunals and the commission work as they are expected to there will be quite a number of cases to cope with <e> <s> this is what we have to face up to the results of our actions in passing this bill into law <e> <s> i have great pleasure in supporting this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned that he was a humble prefect outside the headmasters door <e> <s> was it not the headmistresss door <e>", "<cs> my lords it is complicated <e> <s> i thought the noble lord was talking about his headmistress at no <e> <s> <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for having gone into negative detail at such length <e> <s> i do not intend to proceed further tonight <e> <s> that is obviously a sensible thing to say <e> <s> therefore i should like to withdraw the amendment possibly to return to it on third reading <e> <s> may i say too that i shall not move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now in a very controversial field over which there is considerable public concern <e> <s> the noble lord lord winstanley has gone into great detail and i do not intend to follow him because he has covered the scene very ably indeed <e> <s> but there is one point that i should like to make about the patients consent <e> <s> we might consider the nearest relatives consent as well so that there is a combination of patient and relative <e> <s> it is vital to assert the principle that it is necessary to obtain the patients consent to all treatments and i emphasise all treatments if a patient is considered to be competent <e> <s> there is no reason why a competent patient should have treatment imposed upon him <e> <s> let us also be clear that there is no reason to assume that the assessment of competence should be the exclusive preserve of the medical profession <e> <s> that is why we support the view that a panel should be involved in investigating the competence of patients <e> <s> there is no doubt that this amendment is of the greatest importance and if there is a division we will give the movers our support <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this simply expressed but very important amendment <e> <s> it is an expression of principle and in that connection i would ask the minister a simple question who can possibly believe that a patient who it is agreed is perfectly competent should have treatment imposed on him <e> <s> surely nobody on the benches opposite would make such an extraordinary statement <e> <s> the minister who has been most accommodating throughout the passage of the bill has already expressed the view contained in the amendment in some amendments he has moved this evening <e> <s> this is a neat little amendment which expresses a principle to which i cannot see any objection <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed this matter on tuesday last when i moved an amendment not only incorporating the words of this amendment but also bringing in the question of civil action which aroused the noble lord lord mottistone to rise in anger and to make all sorts of declarations which i could not understand at the time and still do not <e> <s> the main fact is that there will not be an enormous number of people going to litigation <e> <s> i wish that the amendment had included the civil side for here is a field where the patients would need help <e> <s> but i will leave it there <e> <s> there are cases being dealt with at strasbourg which may force the government to amend anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble baroness in her amendment <e> <s> she is slightly modest and i think that more than two members would be better <e> <s> those of us who have had to bear the heat and burden of preparing amendments to this bill know how indebted we are to many voluntary organisations which are working in this field <e> <s> this is an excellent amendment <e> <s> i have a feeling that it is already in the governments mind and i should be very surprised if it is not <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly the point of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord elton has been quite reasonable and given quite detailed assurances on many angles of this particular problem <e> <s> he stressed that local authorities in some areas are doing quite a good job and that local authorities will be expected to do a good job <e> <s> i have to introduce just a little vinegar by saying that i hope the government will ensure that local authorities are assured of sufficient finance to do such a job <e> <s> i accept what the noble lord said and the spirit in which he made his comments <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise strongly to support the amendment of the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> i am very pleased that she has introduced the proposed use of voluntary agencies which i feel will greatly strengthen after-care facilities <e> <s> the noble baroness has stressed that the present powers relating to the provision of after-care are permissive <e> <s> this leaves the way open for reluctant authorities to drag their feet <e> <s> the fact is that some local authorities and some sections of the community fear that the provision of after-care facilities for former mental patients will downgrade their so-called socially respectable residential areas <e> <s> some claim that it would reduce the value of their properties <e> <s> i am strongly opposed to such materialistic and snobbish attitudes but they do exist <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously the noble lord lord winstanley wants to pursue his own little lonely path ok <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton is almost right but not quite <e> <s> our amendment was an attempt at least at the repeal of section and to put something in its place hoping that something better would come along from strasbourg <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton has come forward with a great deal of humour <e> <s> at one stage i was almost going to call the final hymn and go for a collection <e> <s> i would advise him that although the banns have been called this bridegroom is not going to the altar <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is fair to claim that this bill has been improved during its passage through this house and it goes forward to another place who no doubt will give it further consideration <e> <s> it is true that some vital issues such as legal aid have not yet been resolved and we had hoped that there were to be some goodies from the noble lord <e> <s> he mentioned this at the report stage but no doubt he is reserving it for an announcement in the commons <e> <s> as far as amendment no <e> <s> is concerned if it is not settled in another place i feel sure it will be settled in strasbourg <e> <s> this bill cuts across party lines and all sections of the house have played a constructive part in improving it <e> <s> finally i should like to place on record my sincere appreciation of the constructive and co-operative attitude displayed by the noble lord lord elton and his team <e> <s> the noble lord has been very helpful and has displayed a deep sympathy with the bill and its objectives which i am sure we all appreciate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is extremely grateful to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for raising his important and timely motion on the national health service <e> <s> when i first entered your lordships house i was told that whenever i rose to speak in the chamber there would almost certainly be an expert on the subject listening to me <e> <s> following as i do the noble lord lord hunter of newington and having listened to the noble lord the minister i am very much convinced so far as the noble lord lord hunter of newington is concerned that we are listening to one of our acknowledged experts <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i fully appreciate that he has had a very difficult job in replying to a long debate may i say that i raised a very important issue regarding nurses and the crazy way in which the re-selection of nurses is being made <e> <s> it is a very important matter <e> <s> will he therefore give me an undertaking to look into it <e> <s> if necessary i will assist him <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i would readily agree with him that it is not possible to stop nurses applying for a job wherever they want to go <e> <s> secondly does he not agree that the high standard of nursing in britain is entirely due to the state system of nurse training paid for by public money <e> <s> therefore under those circumstances would he not agree with me i mentioned this in the recent debate that so far as the private sector in britain is concerned they should at least pay some token sum towards the training incurred at the expense of the british taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that the countries which have lead-free petrol have it in order to get rid of smog <e> <s> may i ask him is not smog harmful to health <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i too applaud voluntary effort however on this subject of medical research is it not about time that we and i am not talking about governments the people with the government giving the lead directed a great many more of our resources into research in the field of preventive medicine rather than possibly spending hundreds and billions of pounds on methods to destroy life rather should we not vote money to save life <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot follow the noble baroness in congratulating the minister on the bill or in welcoming it <e> <s> i enjoyed the noble baronesss reference to the good old days when some generous employers did not deduct ones sickness benefit but a tremendous number did and if one was out for more than about a fortnight one was out on the dole queue and that was the end of that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while we regret the passing of the <e>", "<cs> in due course <e> <s> the minister said that he gets the money back <e> <s> when <e> <s> how long is the employer out of his money before he gets it back <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak on this amendment for the very simple reason that in the second reading debate i mentioned that with the introduction of the system of sickness benefit being paid by employers to workers there would undoubtedly be problems of industrial relations <e> <s> my noble friend lady jeger has outlined one of the problems that will undoubtedly arise <e> <s> i regard this provision and i use this word in the proper sense as having some bastard relationship to the employment bill which has yet to reach us thank heavens <e> <s> and i hope it will be delayed for a long time <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies i should like to supplement what my noble friend says by asking the noble lord the minister this he says that if a man is unable to get his unemployment benefit from the employer because of a dispute he can go to the authorities <e> <s> that is all right but in the event of his being unconscious in a coma or under intensive <e>", "<cs> that is a matter of opinion <e> <s> we still think this particular item in the bill does give rise to possible difficulties and complications for the employer who has to prove that he was not in dispute and so on <e> <s> i am not going to suggest for a moment that we should press this to a division particularly in view of the avalanche that has appeared from all sorts of remarkable places through doors and side alleys and so on to support the conservative cause <e> <s> i hope of course that they will eventually go away you never know <e> <s> of course we know the government as distinct from ourselves when we were in government

<e> <s> it is however pointless to press this issue tonight and therefore i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend lord ross for his support because if he is anything he is certainly a mine of information and experience not only on political matters but on football matters <e> <s> but that is another subject <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin referred to local democracy

details on an important matter like this i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> but the noble lord knows full well that i shall come back on report i hope refreshed and possibly re-armed <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for those sentiments <e> <s> he included if i am not mistaken a bargain offer <e> <s> i am always very suspicious about bargain offers not in this house but outside because there is always a catch somewhere <e> <s> but the noble lord has been very reasonable in his general approach and at least there is some real concession here <e> <s> as discussions are still taking place i understood from the minister that that is the case perhaps if a probing amendment is put down he will undertake to come back at report stage to give us if possible the result of any further discussions <e> <s> if that is the case i will thank the noble lord very much <e> <s> i beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the noble baroness said that he gave a very fine reply <e> <s> it sounds very nice but the legislation coming before this house and measures taken by the government on local government finance inhibit local authorities in making progress in housing <e> <s> the governments obsession with selling council houses is having a reverse effect when it comes to finding accommodation for people who need it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord please advise the house whether he will persuade local authorities not to increase allotment rents to such a level that plot-holders are forced out in order that the council can sell the land for housing <e> <s> secondly since so much land is available will the minister encourage local authorities to acquire it for allotment gardens and gardening activity generally <e> <s>

difficult position <e>", "<cs> it satisfies me to the extent that i shall have something to read in <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for the extremely lengthy reply he has given <e> <s> i think he has given me a little more detail than was given in another place <e> <s> that after all is something that we all expect from this chamber <e> <s> therefore i will beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think i can be satisfied with the governments amendment because if i remember correctly it followed an undertaking given by the noble lord lord bellwin who gave me a very broad hint of possible action later <e> <s> this appears to be <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl and also to the noble lord lord bellwin <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware and the noble baroness has to some extent underlined this that statistics do not necessarily disclose the cold facts of life <e> <s> i do not agree with the noble lord when he says that some authorities indicating a very few of them have reduced services <e> <s> i should like to know from him if not now then at some future date what in real terms has been the reduction in personal social services in most areas

the worst examples of the lot <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the noble lord come straight at some time or other and instead of playing around with statistics and percentages give us the actual facts of the cuts that have been imposed in the various vital services <e> <s> because it is a fact that these have been imposed and the noble baroness lady faithfull has more or less agreed with me on the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back again but is it not the fact that these cuts have been actually imposed <e> <s> the real trouble is the secretary of state for the environment and the way he has treated local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it is no good him glossing over the top salaries review position <e> <s> is he further aware that there is considerable discord among nurses and threats of industrial action which of course would be deplored <e> <s> the noble lord lord boothby is quite right in saying that at this time the announcement of the top salaries awards has made an impression on the public and that this is a very important irritant factor in the negotiations in the industrial situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend lord darling of hillsborough on bringing the bill forward after its very successful passage through another place <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate mr norman atkinson and particularly those who drafted the bill <e> <s> it is a very important measure not only as regards its effect of increased protection to the health of the public but also as regards increasing the severity of punishment for an unscrupulous minority attempting financial gain by imposing a threat to public health <e> <s> to take determined action to endanger the public health is in fact a criminal act <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord from the cross-benches said that the trouble was that people were getting in wages more than they earned would the noble baroness agree that there is at least one great exception and that is the nurses who are underpaid for what they do and are being exploited at the present time by an inadequate salary increase <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that although undertakings are given by unions in this regrettable industrial dispute that patient care will not be affected it is inevitable that patient care will be affected however much help is given by administrative officers and so on <e> <s> i cannot understand the governments attitude to this position because nurses particularly should be dealt with as a special case <e> <s> secondly the government will not accept arbitration will not agree to arbitration <e> <s> the government will not seek arbitration <e> <s> this is the point <e> <s> it is all very well <e>", "<cs> is the minister aware and i am well able to take care of myself here without assistance from the government side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it would appear that the government are set on their course and will not do their best to try to resolve this regrettable dispute <e> <s> further is the minister aware that the whitley council have put forward a settlement which lines up with the governments attitude <e> <s> this is a matter of great importance <e> <s> it is a matter that has happened before and must not happen again and it is about time that the government did not take advantage of nurses who because of their membership of the royal college of nursing do not take industrial action <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his explanation <e> <s> he has indicated that there is some ground for quarrelling with the grant system but of course i accept that that matter does not come within this bill <e> <s> i do not think that there is any point in pressing this amendment at this stage <e> <s> i shall read very carefully what the noble lord has said and who knows <e> <s> i may come back to it on third reading <e> <s> however that is a matter for me to decide <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords to some extent the government are coming a little closer to what i am after <e> <s> may i say very bluntly and directly that this is in no way a political point and has nothing to do with any political complexion of any council <e> <s> this is just a question of principle so far as i am concerned <e> <s> i cannot accept that a committee of local councillors would deal with these matters <e> <s> if the noble earl had been on a local authority as i have and sat in the old days on the old poor law appeals committee as i used to on saturday mornings he would realise that some councillors have not got a clue about these things and some are not always sympathetic <e> <s> this is a point we must bear in mind <e> <s> therefore we want something a little more direct more legal so far as the individual is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said before i sat down <e> <s>

wish to support the amendment and draw to the attention of the noble earl what he said during the committee stage as reported at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask just a simple innocent little question <e> <s> what is the difference between weeks and three months <e> <s> secondly if it is three months and there is a difference is it three calendar months <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord allow me <e> <s> that depends on which part of the year you are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords the trouble as the noble earl will probably admit is that the government are too conservative with a small c <e> <s> i am only asking in this amendment for the maximum of four more people and quite frankly it seems somewhat ridiculous to say that that would make the committee too large <e> <s> i still think that it is very essential and perhaps the secretary of state will bear in mind that there is a need for somebody with definite local authority experience <e> <s> it is no good saying

character of that type who knows what he is talking about <e> <s> he is a good local authority man as distinct from the other members of the front bench who do not have a clue <e> <s> i regret <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when the national health service was brought in it was not just a question of covering british people the principle was that anybody taken ill within our shores would receive adequate medical attention irrespective of his or her means or colour <e> <s> are not the government going contrary to the general spirit of the original health service <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord why the government will not drop this scheme which will cause a great deal of difficulty for the hospital administrative staff while there is a danger of racialism creeping in

up to the fact that they must reach a decision on their own to meet a situation created by this very reactionary government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that the noble lord lord auckland thanked him for his helpful reply when in point of fact he did not get a reply to his question <e> <s> secondly can the minister state whether this information is actually in the department of health and social security <e> <s> it must be <e> <s> local health authorities have the information and they must be aware of it <e> <s> i do not see how cost comes into it when the information is there <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to come back to the noble lord and to his reply to me about the difficulty of getting the required information <e> <s> he said that there were

very briefly my lords i would support this amendment because i note <e>", "<cs> surprise surprise most certainly my lords <e> <s> as an ex-serviceman i am very pleased indeed to support it <e> <s> the reason why i support it is that i prefer it very much to amendment no <e> <s> which the noble earl lord avon will no doubt very shortly come forward to move <e> <s> that is a permissive amendment in that some local authorities may apply a total disregard and others may not <e> <s> that is not exactly a fair deal to war pensioners which is why i prefer the first amendment <e> <s> i will not delay your lordships any further but will merely indicate our support for it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord trefgarne of course has caused no surprise by the fact that he will not accept my amendment because after some many weeks and months on these benches one gets used to that <e> <s> but he has made the point i want to be fair that there is consultation with ministers by local authorities <e> <s> as to whether one more or two more people on the committee will make it too large that is a matter for argument <e> <s> there is a theory that small committees get business done

arbitration was carried out and the nurses got an increased pay award the money would have to come out of the health service which is already strained financially too much at the present time <e>", "<cs> this is a private members bill of course and from this bench i should merely like to say that i think the committee should accept the detailed explanation given by the noble lord lord sandys and that under the circumstances the noble lord lord mottistone should withdraw his amendment and i would echo the words of my noble friend lord darling that the committee should allow the bill to proceed with the greatest dispatch and then the government can carry on with the detailed work that they have announced <e>", "<cs> my lords there is an understandable air of euphoria about because of the result of this campaign but as the the noble baroness has said there are regrettable casualties <e> <s> let us face the fact that there are over dead that have to be decently buried <e> <s> such was the human cost of victory for us and defeat for others <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the noble baronesss supplementary question to him should be rephrased in that it is a matter

independence and feeling of use to the community cannot be ignored <e>", "<cs> my lords yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl i am somewhat flattered <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that everyone will of course abhor any action which will inconvenience and cause hardship to patients <e> <s> but is the noble lord aware too and there is a degree of hypocrisy

a position which we all regret <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that even before this regretted action waiting lists were already very long <e> <s> secondly would he not agree that even at the present time the pattern is very varied throughout the country that in some cases the action is causing minimal delay <e> <s> finally bearing in mind the present situation of already existing long waiting lists will the government withdraw their freeze on new appointments of medical staff <e> <s> they are at the moment held back <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the noble lord to say that the government will not stop their freeze on new medical appointments <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble lord may deplore the effects of industrial unrest is he not aware that it would do both him and the government well to deplore the cause of it all <e> <s> further i would ask the noble lord whether he agrees that if in fact the national health service workers are so vital to the health of patients it is not time that the government gave them the same priority as they have given to firemen and police in pay deals <e> <s> if the country has to pay then we should pay <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that though there may have been increases from the government when it comes to a showdown the workers will be very little better off and in some cases involving nurses

discussion <e> <s> in general i would welcome this move and no doubt the house will probably have the beneficial advice of the noble baroness lady mcfarlane who has had a most distinguished career in the nursing field <e> <s> this is a body which is partly-elected partly-appointed <e> <s> i am wondering how the appointed members will be selected <e> <s> i assume that the minister will have a submission of a panel of names from which he can make a choice <e> <s> i assume that probably some of the non-elected might even he on that list <e> <s> one of the worrying features of this is the representation of nurses involved in the mental health field which we know is rather overlooked and has been neglected for some years <e> <s> the minister gave some assurance that any balance would be adjusted when the names are appointed by the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that although we would accept that the report was confidential it seems very significant indeed that there have been considerable leaks to the press of the contents of the report <e> <s> can the noble baroness give an assurance to the house that there was no inspired leakage <e> <s> the publication of details has given rise to a great deal of public anxiety <e> <s> may i further assure the noble baroness that the bland assurance given by the prime minister at the conservative party conference has not eased public anxiety over the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the question of the cost of drugs is one that needs thorough investigation so far as the health service is concerned because it is a field where there could be considerable savings without affecting patient care <e> <s> secondly is the noble lord aware that i can give some slight evidence to support the noble baroness <e> <s> i use a proprietary medicine occasionally and recently in malta i bought a small tube for the equivalent of p it is an item manufactured in great britain and it costs me in the united kingdom p <e>", "<cs> my lords following the very helpful supplementary question to the government by the noble baroness which almost reminded me of a planted question i should like to ask the noble lord what real terms means <e> <s> real terms to me means an expansion of services yet the government say that they are spending more and the services are getting less and less <e> <s> the noble lord should have a look at the south-east metropolitan regional health authoritys proposals to reduce services by millions and the proposals of other metropolitan authorities as well <e> <s> so real terms in the sense that we regard it is a meaningless term when the government use it in the way in which the noble lord has used it <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i say that the noble baroness lady macleod in thanking her supporters as she expected in advance has <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> generally speaking i welcome these amendments <e> <s> indeed with one exception i welcome most of them <e> <s> apart from that i am very pleased indeed to see amendment no <e> <s> and also amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in the early stages we tried to move such amendments but the government have had reconsiderations elsewhere which is acceptable to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise not to speak against the amendments but to accept them but i want to revert to the remarks made by the noble lord lord winstanley about the short notice that we have had and so on <e> <s> these are the facts of life towards the end of a session and we have got to put up with it <e> <s> i rise to my feet to be fair to the noble baroness the leader of the house and to the chief whip for sending to us quite a detailed list and a simple explanation of a number of amendments <e> <s> for that the government are to be thanked <e> <s> their action is appreciated <e> <s> i would also say that i hope that they will be as generous to me later this evening as i am to them at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords there is just one point which i should like to raise <e> <s> i was having a consultation outside on the understanding that there would be a series of statements for about three-quarters of an hour <e> <s> however suddenly to my horror i saw this bill put up on the screen and i broke the four-minute mile in order to get here but to no avail <e> <s> i hope that we shall get due notice and warning in advance <e>", "<cs> my lords i would welcome these amendments because they go a long way to ease the minds of a lot of people on this

i want to say only a few words <e> <s> i have listened to the argument and i think that probably much heavy weather is being made regarding the amendment <e> <s> i have the fear that if the noble lord lord mottistone presses his amendment to a division or if the government withdraw their clause the bill at this <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so but i am dealing only with the technicalities of the situation <e> <s> i am only trying to be helpful because i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased indeed to see amendment no <e> <s> which means that any code of practice will receive scrutiny by both houses of parliament <e> <s> that is very important indeed and it was a matter that some of us pressed in this house <e> <s> the other matter that pleases me is that although the government do

elton <e> <s> it appears that that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had quite a wide-ranging extremely interesting and facinating debate today on home affairs <e> <s> quite a number of people have put their points of view from their own experience <e> <s> one of the highlights of todays proceedings was the maiden speech by my noble friend lord rea who in a very short maiden speech poured out facts and figures which are bound to impress us and make us think <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord who is in general practice in an area which calls for a lot of hard and intensive work will be able to spare us some of his very valuable time because frankly we need his help his advice and extensive experience <e>", "<cs> mine was not mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish on behalf of the house to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for repeating that statement a lengthy one <e> <s> may i first ask him to confirm my attention was diverted momentarily that he used the sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords the timing of this statement is significant in fact suspiciously so i understand that the royal college of nursing is meeting today to decide on government offers and at the same time as we know delicate negotiations are going on in another direction <e> <s> of course this is an offer only to nurses midwives and health visitors and not to ancillary staff <e> <s> indeed no mention is made of other groups of workers namely ancillary workers and i should like to know why not <e> <s> as for the offer one assumes that negotiations will continue for both sections and it is obvious that they will continue on <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one point on which i should like to correct the noble lord the minister if i may <e> <s> he referred to the fact that the only people who had gone on strike were the ancillary workers and he categorised the whole situation as involving ancillary workers only <e> <s> he has visited hospitals and so have i it is a fact that in the case of the great majority of ancillary workers what they have done has been done with extreme reluctance and in many cases on only a token basis <e> <s> there are a few places where there has been industrial action and the media have emphasised those but not those cases where the staff have done their best to keep going <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any possibility of using these disused lines for food production and particularly for the provision of allotment gardens <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister aware that the charge of falsifying statements to the dhss is a very serious charge indeed <e> <s> furthermore is it true <e> <s> if it is not true then i would suggest to the house that the noble lord lord rugby should withdraw that particular charge <e>", "<cs> my lords even ignoring the implication of industrial action the necessity of which of course is regretted are the government aware that financial stringency imposed on health authorities is having a serious adverse effect on patient care as for example the proposed closure of tadworth court hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords my first pleasant duty is to thank the noble minister for his detailed statement on the provisions of the bill it certainly was detailed <e> <s> however i must admit that i felt that his claims for the bill in his early remarks were somewhat exaggerated <e> <s> on th november last during a debate on the gracious speech i drew attention to the fact that a measure would be introduced to improve the health and social services <e> <s> i said that i had feared the worst but i was reassured by the speech of the noble baroness lady young <e> <s> then unheralded and unforeseen the government have produced with <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the government whether or not it would be better if the one penny were to be divided into as malta does mils thus avoiding increases in prices far greater than are actually necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i was trying to explain that in malta they have three coins known as mils amounting to and that equals one penny <e> <s> this would avoid price increases of a small nature because the present halfpenny is worth more than the old penny <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like very much to thank the noble lord lord banks for introducing this debate today <e> <s> of course we should listen to the noble lord with some great care because the house must recognise that he is an expert in the field in which he was speaking today <e> <s> i would also congratulate the noble lord lord trefgarne who had a difficult brief but who read it extremely well and i would compliment him on that fact <e> <s> i would not go as far as the noble baroness lady seear who if i heard her correctly seemed to indicate that the noble lord had a screw loose somewhere <e> <s> the noble earl lord onslow who has now left the chamber referred to the creation of wealth <e> <s> of course the big problem is who creates the wealth and the greater problem is who shares in it <e> <s> certainly today million unemployed are not creating wealth but unfortunately because of their situation they are taking it from the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i want first to thank the noble lord the minister for the very detailed and friendly way in which he has explained the provisions of what is quite an important bill <e> <s> i very much appreciate also the remarks he made in paying tribute to the help given by opposition members in another place <e> <s> if i may say so this help underlines the non-controversial nature of the bill <e> <s> as the noble lord has stated this is generally an agreed measure but nevertheless it is very important as well <e> <s> i personally regard the bill as being in the public interest <e> <s> it is a little complicated in parts but the bill does safeguard the consumer if on the subject of teeth that is the right word <e>", "<cs> i cannot quite see the point <e> <s> there are committees in the health service to which voluntary organisations are asked to nominate a representative <e> <s> most of these voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that his right honourable friend is a very reluctant person <e> <s> i entirely agree about that <e> <s> my view is that he has been far too reluctant on far too many issues <e> <s> however i shall not waste the time of the committee now because we still have the report stage <e> <s> we shall not give up this point <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i also say that i support the amendment moved by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i am not withdrawing the amendment at this stage because i cannot understand the government here <e> <s> the government put into the consultative document <e>", "<cs> i can see the points that the noble lord is making <e> <s> he makes one slight mistake and as a family man he will understand this well because he has got some lively children <e> <s> children are a little more mature today and can reach decisions for themselves a little earlier than we used to in our days <e> <s> i am correcting him only on that point <e> <s> i have gone beyond the age of having young children but i have got some very energetic grandchildren <e> <s> they know their own minds at times <e> <s> i will not tease him on that point too much because it is not relevant <e> <s> i see the point that he has made <e> <s> i fully understand it <e> <s> i want to read what he said in <e>", "<cs> i rise very briefly to say that i fully support the noble baroness <e> <s> the first amendment is an obvious one which is worthy of support and the second is a very sensible one which i also entirely support <e> <s> i hope that the government will see fit to accept them <e>", "<cs> i am not going to get involved in that argument <e> <s> i know that there is a difference between men and women i have been married for years and i have found out <e> <s> i am not too happy with the reply given by the noble lord the minister old age is a phrase that does not define anything <e> <s> if it were taken to mean the minimum state pension age it would be defined <e> <s> i am not going to argue the toss at this late hour because i have already been made to feel older than i am and goodness knows i am old enough <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not agree that regulations are necessarily the best thing <e> <s> this is so vitally important as the noble baroness lady masham of ilton so graphically described that we should in fact have this provision stated very clearly in the bill <e> <s> i go further and say i would certainly accept <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that the aim of the government was to obtain consistency in charges by local authorities <e> <s> is he aware that there is a widespread inconsistency at the moment and that if the proposals of this bill are carried forward that inconsistency will remain <e> <s> the noble lord said that the amendment is defective <e> <s> that may be so but he referred to clause and he has not yet come to the other amendments that i have tabled on this issue <e> <s> this to me on the home help service in particular is a personal matter of great principle <e> <s> therefore i propose to divide the committee on the principle and if i am successful the government may have the opportunity to amend the bill in some way or another at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the amendment because it is most important to the position of disabled people <e> <s> we in this country should be able to afford to give the disabled the necessary aids to living <e> <s> wonderful work is done for example by the voluntary organisations but by introducing what is an unfortunate phrase into the clause the government are doing a disservice <e> <s> for that reason i strongly support the principles so eloquently expressed by the noble baroness lady masham and i hope the amendment will have the support of the committee <e>", "<cs> of course you are <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord referring to old-age pensioners doing newspaper rounds and earning fabulous sums <e>", "<cs> the noble lord mentioned guidance <e> <s> who is going to give the guidance to local authorities <e> <s> is it the ama <e> <s> if that is the case the noble lord is as well aware as i am that so far negotiations have foundered <e> <s> there is no possible chance that the ama can formulate a set of guidance to local authorities <e> <s> he knows that as well as i do <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has been quite generous i nearly said for a change but that would not be fair in indicating that there is some sympathy with the amendment <e> <s> as he has undertaken to see whether there is a case for formulating something i shall willingly withdraw the amendment <e> <s> let us look forward to the report stage or if that is not to be <e> <s> possibly to the third reading <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has gone to town in a big way because he has discussed all the subsequent amendments which i have yet to move <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> that may have been healthy anticipation but i had no such idea <e> <s> it has put me in a spot <e>", "<cs> i was so astounded <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> apparently a technical hitch is involved <e> <s> on that basis i shall reconsider the amendment and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> in view of the technicalities involved and the resulting defects i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that is a matter for consideration <e> <s> i want the government to think about this because a child in care should be treated on the same basis as a child in hospital <e> <s> the parents of a child in hospital are not subjected to the particular points about which i have complained <e> <s> all i ask is that the matter should be considered <e> <s> separation can be agonising even though there may be good reasons for it and the question of reuniting the child with the parent is vitally important <e> <s> it is possible that visits can help in that way <e> <s> i am not a social worker and i do not have the great experience of the noble baroness lady faithful but there is something in this amendment and i hope that the government will look into it <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord banks for stressing a point which i could have enlarged upon but i found myself getting into the position which the noble baroness lady faithfull described at a previous committee sitting when she said she felt that she was bashing her head against a brick wall <e> <s> therefore i did not continue to speak too long on this particular point <e> <s> a promise has been given to look into this

government want <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> that seems to be quite a good idea because it suddenly dawned on me that the report stage will be next year after the christmas recess but please do not make it too quick because we want to consider this very carefully <e> <s> the noble lord has made a fair offer and i accept what he has said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord says the next one does he mean no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> yes i beg the noble lords pardon <e> <s> in view of what he has

many others and who are a responsible body should have some degree of representation <e> <s> i should like to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all thank the noble lord lord cockfield for his very clear and detailed explanation of the purpose of this small but not unimportant bill <e> <s> it is in fact a necessary bill to give a little relief to industry especially at a time when bankruptcies are still increasing and many firms have gone out of business with the consequent regretted loss of skilled labour capital and equipment <e> <s> if this bill eases even if slightly this regrettable situation then indeed we welcome a crumb of comfort albeit somewhat grudgingly welcomed by the cbi <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from the percentage of people found guilty may i ask the noble lord to say how many people were detained <e> <s> would he agree that a better system should be found to check on these matters rather than the spectacular type of mass raid which can also inflict a great deal of anxiety on innocent people who would like to claim but who might be deterred from so doing in case they should become involved in a similar incident <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not so sure that we would readily agree to do so but that is a matter of opinion <e> <s> first let me thank my noble friend lord molloy for raising quite an important issue as regards which we have had some very excellent and authoritative contributions from noble lords <e> <s> as other speakers have indicated there is no doubt whatever that the morale of staff in the national health service is today very low particularly at hospital level <e> <s> there are two main causes and the first is the bitterness still existing over the recent pay dispute <e> <s> strong-arm tactics may have given the government a victory but they have left a legacy of mistrust which is indeed souring industrial relations <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and i am not going to make a second

carefully chosen <e> <s> there is no <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to answer my supplementary about the present position of those on home dialysis <e>", "<cs> my lords i see no reason why we should not support this particular amendment it is an obvious one <e> <s> but i take this opportunity to register a very strong protest at the large number of amendments tabled by the government at this report stage <e> <s> of amendments nearly are government amendments <e> <s> in addition there are four new clauses and two new schedules which were tabled last tuesday and were not

the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords all that i will say about it is that the noble lord read his brief beautifully and in so doing blinded me with science <e> <s> therefore i must defer comment on the matter until we get to third reading because the new clause is even more mystifying than the original one <e>", "<cs> this is all becoming rather confusing because to my simple mind in the medical profession when a man reaches the top of the tree and is a top surgeon he rejoices in the title of mr <e> <s> i think that here we have an attempt to bring a degree of snobocracy into the profession

practice in the meantime should not necessarily have suffered <e> <s> then there is the case of the patients <e> <s> i agree in so saying that there should be careful supervision of the practice in that period because there might possibly be some rather smart dealing going on <e> <s> i think the noble baroness has a good case in relation to a qualified person and for that reason i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before we proceed on this rather unusual debate i would also draw attention in relation to this extraordinary bill to the fact that the bill as amended on report was not available in the printed paper office until late afternoon on friday last and thus not readily available to noble lords until yesterday <e> <s> once again as on report noble lords have not been given

underlined the importance of the position <e> <s> when you have a claimant and an appeal in such circumstances i think it is essential that there should be two people <e> <s> it is possible that the minister will accept this point and it may be that there will be an amendment in another place <e> <s> i think it is a clear-cut case and i fully support it <e>", "<cs> my lords on second reading i described the bill as a ragbag of a bill <e> <s> unfortunately one local newspaper described my remarks as a ratbag of a bill something i would never say <e> <s> i regarded it as a ragbag of a bill

it goes <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord reads the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i was very pleasurably surprised to hear the answer that he gave <e> <s> it would be a great help to the house and indeed to the country if the location of the various brain scanning facilities within the national health service was known since there may be areas where there is a serious shortage of such facilities <e> <s> so far as the cost is concerned compared with the usefulness of the machine is a flea bite <e> <s> if one compares the cost of a single fighter aircraft for instance with the cost of the machine one will realise that the cost of one aircraft would probably be enough to buy two brain scanners <e> <s> in view of the considerable use made by the private sector of national health service facilities where in the health service there are areas of shortage of this type of equipment is it possible that the private sector may become involved on a basis of reasonable cost in relation to what it enjoys from the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i too have welcomed the bill at all its stages and i would agree with the remarks of the noble lord lord trefgarne about the valuable contributions made by the two dental experts <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes is not here tonight because on one occasion if i remember correctly we had an extraordinary insight into the social habits of australian old-age pensioners and i was hoping that more secrets would be revealed tonight <e> <s> however

aware that parental choice is being negatived in many cases by local authorities changing the catchment areas so that where a family has two children in one school and then there is a change of catchment area the younger child cannot go to the school with his brothers in that particular area <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to express my very grateful thanks as i am sure the whole house does to the noble lord lord harvington for introducing this debate <e> <s> he has been rather quiet lately but i remember him as a very excellent chairman of ways and means in another place <e> <s>

only scanners but operations as well <e> <s> if it is impossile to publish this information in <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is true that considerable savings can be made on drugs in the national health service would not the noble lord agree that it is somewhat dangerous to leave the responsibility to pharmacists when doctors should <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that that is a completely unsatisfactory answer on the part of the government <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that there is considerable public concern about this matter in addition to the fact that there is an implied threat to the health of pregnant women and young children <e> <s> is he further aware that it is no use whatever telling people in inner london and other great cities not to grow their vegetables in that area but to go to the greengrocer because in point of fact and i live in north-west kent considerable quantities of produce are grown immediately adjacent to motorways and therefore are open to a considerable amount of lead pollution <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will be able to give a more satisfactory reply <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i have seen the press statement and that i have read it <e> <s> there is much to be said in regard to the point that social background should probably he taken into account but the governments answer is completely at variance with scientific reports that have been made recently not only by clear the organisation responsible for a press campaign but also by other reputable scientific organisations <e> <s> is the minister aware or will he admit that there is sitting at the moment a royal commission the report of which is due on th april which is a notable date since it is my birthday <e> <s> will the government undertake to give very careful consideration to the royal commissions report come forward with their conclusions and place the matter before both houses of parliament <e> <s> judging from what the minister has indicated at the moment the government do not seem to have a clue and are completely dodging the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell the house how many of these new houses are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will wish to thank the noble lord lord hunter of newington for raising this debate <e> <s> there has for some of us been a difficulty <e> <s> i must apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> the noble lord lord colwyn only obtained his copy of the book on monday <e> <s> my noble friend lord wells-pestell seems to have been very devious and got his on saturday <e> <s> the books arrived in the printed paper office only late on friday afternoon <e> <s>

concerned i wish to put on record that it is no fault of the officials of the house <e> <s> our respected clerk of the parliaments gave permission for copies to be obtained but the publishers did not send them until the last possible moment <e> <s> i shall now take away a valuable book for further consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> is the noble lord talking about charges for private beds <e> <s> i referred to the other services given in various parts of the hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned the expression down the pan

lord trefgarne for his <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the best answer that he can give my noble friend lord bishopston is quite simple get on your bike <e>", "<cs> i do not have any intention of pressing them at the present time for various reasons <e> <s> at the same time i cannot accept entirely what the noble lord has said in reply <e> <s> one of the problems is that his department has been cutting staff <e> <s> in fact the whole theme of his speech was the necessity for financial savings <e> <s> he said it would cost hundreds of millions of pounds to do this double check up each year <e> <s> i cannot accept this because he is dealing with the old methods that have been employed whereas i am suggesting that modern methods should be used <e> <s> his whole theme was financial saving which is the basis of this and every other social security bill that we have had since the start of this parliament <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment which i consider to be excellent and also extremely acceptable to the government who now have the opportunity to prove that they are prepared to look into the future with shall i say a more benevolent eye than they have looked into the past since they have been in office <e> <s> this is an arrangement whereby the government can make up their mind in due course <e> <s> it does not tie them down to detail as did my amendments excellent though they were <e> <s> if the government refuse this amendment the mind boggles <e> <s> there is no reason whatever why any reasonable government should not accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord trefgarne referred to the fact that an additional staff would be necessary <e> <s> there is the possibility that by taking people from the unemployment queue and thus relieving the state of the need to pay unemployment benefit there will be some saving of public money <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment was tabled by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> i did not give permission for my name to be added to the amendment but my name as well as the name of my noble friend lady jeger appear on the marshalled list <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that i do not know anything about this <e> <s> therefore as there is no allowance in evidence obviously the amendment is not being moved <e> <s> i am not moving it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we had better speak now rather than on the motion that the bill do now pass <e> <s> i realise that the bill has to go through because if it does not go through pensioners will not receive their increase in november whether it be per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> in my candid opinion it is a pity that the government did not accept the amendment put down by the noble lord lord banks to consider six-monthly reviews in future <e> <s> in committee the noble lord lord trefgarne said that that would mean extra staff <e> <s> later in reply to a point that i put to him he said that he doubted whether any people who were unemployed were qualified to do the work <e> <s> in passing i would remind the noble lord that there are among the unemployed many university graduates as well as grammar school sixth-formers with o- and a- level qualifications <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to thank the noble lord for the rather extensive and long statement he has made and i would also like to congratulate him on his new appointment i certainly wish him well <e> <s> if he can rise to the standards of his predecessor he will have achieved considerable advance <e> <s> however my congratulations to the noble lord are very genuinely tinged with a degree of sympathy for him because he has to deal with such a controversial and complicated measure at his first appearance in his new job at the dispatch box <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that unemployment is a domestic and financial tragedy to those involved <e> <s> in view of the chancellors recent statement on cuts in public expenditure and the obvious signs of further cuts to come will the minister give a concrete undertaking that unemployment benefit will not be cut and furthermore that the system of

points some of which i agree with some i do not <e> <s> so far as forms and are concerned this really is based on the medical recommendations required before a patient can be detained under section of the act for assessment <e> <s> there are new features of this section and they are that the patient is admitted for assessment which includes of course the ability to impose treatment against the patients will in accordance with part iv of the act and that the patient now has the right to apply to a mental health review tribunal to be discharged if the tribunal thinks fit in the first days of his detention <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to comment on these tribunal rules <e> <s> one thing worries me <e> <s> in the previous debate the noble lord lord mottistone referred to a question of balance and i rather thought that he inferred that i was unbalanced <e> <s> i hope that he does not really think so <e> <s> i would very much support the noble lord about the need to give simple easily understood advice to nearest relatives <e> <s> that is vitally important <e>", "<cs> my lords we have certainly had a very good debate and first i should like to congratualte the noble lord lord lawrence on his maiden speech <e> <s> we look forward to further contributions from the noble lord <e> <s> one thing of which i am sure is that the noble lord feels better now than before he made his maiden speech <e> <s> that is a feeling of relief that one can understand i having made three all told <e>", "<cs> my lords as official spokesman from these benches it falls to my pleasant lot to thank my noble friend lord molloy for raising this vital issue today an issue which is worrying many people throughout the country <e> <s> i also look forward to hearing the maiden speech of my noble friend lord ennals for two reasons <e> <s> first he was lucky enough to follow me in norwich north <e> <s> unfortunately the boundary commission decided that his stay would not be too long <e> <s> but we welcome him to this house and he is to follow me again today not that at this bench i boastfully claim to know better than he does for he has great experience in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to give an assurance that the government will consider extending the period during which staff cuts have to be made <e> <s> the evidence shows that insufficient time has been allowed for proper discussion as to reorganisation <e> <s> will the minister therefore discuss with the tuc and the staff organisations the possibility of an extension or delay <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that i just do not understand the noble baroness lady lane-fox being somewhat disconcerted by the reply <e> <s> it is a good thing that people can come to britain for treatment just as much as people can go to ec countries for treatment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady trumpington said that about cases a year had been referred to ec countries for treatment <e> <s> can she give the figure for the number of people treated on holiday due to accidents and the many other causes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one further question for the noble baroness and i am sure she will not mind answering <e> <s> there is a very important point on ec agreements <e> <s> before anyone proceeds abroad from this country a somewhat complicated form must be completed <e> <s> does the noble baroness agree that that must be stressed <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i thank the noble lord for repeating a very important statement but he need not have taken the trouble <e> <s> if he had looked in the library at the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord glenarthur made the point that the matter before us now is not one of health care but the supply of glasses <e> <s> that is an amazing statement <e> <s> in many cases disease is identified when somebody applies for glasses <e> <s> i could quote diabetes and many other diseases which are discovered as a result of eye tests and the provision of glasses <e> <s> so it is a question of health care not merely a question of buying glasses off the peg somewhere else <e>", "<cs> my lords we are dealing with a very important subject unfortunately at a late hour and in an unstarred question debate <e> <s> the subject needs much wider discussion although one should be very grateful indeed to all those noble lords who have taken part in the debate so far <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we on these benches welcome the statement that the government do not intend to privatise blood <e> <s> the other point about which i should like to ask and i think it is relevant is whether it is a fact that we are still importing blood <e> <s> if that is the case should not the full charge be made for the price paid for blood from overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house whether it is still a fact that crown property which is to be disposed of must first be offered to other government departments before proceeding to public sale <e> <s> secondly if a sale is effected who gets the money <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank my noble friend lord molloy for raising the question on the epsom hospitals <e> <s> however one must frankly admit that we have moved into a general debate on the mental health service and indeed we are really indulging now in a

which is long and complicated <e> <s> i must congratulate the noble lord on the way in which he has managed to cope with it because no member of this house could say that he could not understand what the noble lord was saying or at least the words that he was using <e> <s> but the content of course is a different matter <e> <s> incidentally i would point out that through some technical hitch <e>

payments and increased retirement pension payments involved as a result of the two reorganisations carried out by the present government and their predecessors under mr heath <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned the figure of million <e> <s> i can hardly credit this <e> <s> is this the cost of reducing the national health service <e> <s> the figure is astonishing because that amount would build about three hospitals apart from extending services <e> <s> it seems to be a staggering figure <e> <s> can the noble lord confirm it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that as a result of financial pressure on district health authorities inevitably the smaller hospital is the victim of projected or actual closure <e> <s> the tendency today is for the larger hospital to survive at the expense of the smaller one <e> <s> furthermore can he tell the house how many more projected closures are in the pipeline so far as the new policy of the government is concerned <e> <s> perhaps he

gardening has the status of a recreation <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say what is the level of gas flaring in westminster at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that to assume on the basis of these figures as the noble baroness did and as the noble lord himself did that everything is all right in the national health service would mean that the noble lord is talking through the back of his neck <e> <s> if he has any connection with any local area health authority he will find that they are at their wits end to provide the services needed mainly due to the governments policy of denying finance to many authorities particularly in the south east <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill he

bucket of cold water <e> <s> however we can still progress <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend lord graham because in point of fact he is not new to these matters <e> <s> he did some valuable work with his colleague mr nigel spearing in the house of commons they are experienced local government men <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that nutritional standards could be advanced considerably if the government were to campaign to encourage people to grow their own fresh vegetables <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the government are considering

reply <e> <s> but bearing in mind the governments interest in and devotion to voluntary organisations will he not accept that the decisions taken here on the housing and building control bill are

<s> to call this an added burden on the local authorities is too ridiculous to be true <e> <s> here you have a junior clerk employed on other duties <e> <s> the council receives an application for an allotment <e> <s> it is recorded in a register and other letters come in and they are recorded <e> <s> then councillors can from time to time go to see their officers like any good councillor should do before they get involved in anything and find out what the demand is <e> <s> if there is a big demand they have every democratic right <e> <s> but to say that it is taking time bureaucracy increasing bureaucracy is the most stupid statement that i have ever heard from any government department <e> <s> the house must be frankly amazed <e> <s> in any case it is normal business practice to register letters received <e> <s> the government talk so much about consulting business people in regard to legislation but here they are acting in the most reactionary victorian manner that really is staggering <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government say whether all these new investors which the minister has listed will have an equal opportunity to decide whether their company should make political contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his smooth answer to my noble friend is simply not acceptable <e> <s> is he further aware that unemployment imposes tremendous mental strain not only on the displaced wage earner but on his wife and family as well <e> <s> i have experience in this connection and so i know what i am talking about <e> <s> it is therefore essential as the government are longwinded in any attempts to solve the unemployment problem for them to do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say to what extent were civil defence methods or the civil defence organisation used in the recent rather terrible gas explosion at putney <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the chairman of the thames water authority seems to be in severe disagreement with the government on this particular issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i wish this clause and clause deleted <e> <s> the reason for my opposition to the retention of clause is that as with clause it could be held to be imposing extra work upon local authorities at a time when they are experiencing great <e>", "<cs> the words are the same <e> <s> i have already explained the reason <e> <s> i oppose the inclusion of this clause <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat surprised at the noble lord lord skelmersdale <e> <s> i am getting the impression that private members bills are not liked by government departments <e> <s> we are presuming to do something that they would like to do but never get down to doing <e> <s> the noble lord lord skelmersdale quite rightly quoted the thorpe report <e> <s> one of the reasons for this bill which has a lot of good points in spite of what the noble lord says is that the thorpe report has never been implemented <e> <s> i tried when my own party was in power to get the thorpe report implemented and the noble baroness then replying for the government said that at some time that might be done but it has never been done <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord said that with the passage of time the coin would become a greenish-yellow colour are we to infer that it will become mouldy <e> <s> secondly the noble lord lord oneill who put the original question is quite right but he omitted one point <e>", "<cs> my lords should we not be considering in addition to the problem of artificial light those who have poor eyesight i do not mean blind people who will therefore have a job in identifying this coin <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say what constitutes demand and what constitutes service <e> <s> on what basis is lack of demand or increased demand decided <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness give some indication if at all possible as to when the problem of flight paths and of air traffic will be solved <e> <s> the present descent into gibraltar is enough to put one off flying and to discourage tourism <e>", "<cs> my lords i willingly join in the alliance with the noble lord lord winstanley and to a great extent with the noble baroness lady robson as regards the health service <e> <s> i support the appeal of the noble lord lord winstanley that there should be fewer attacks on the service <e> <s> i have good reason to say that because it so happens that i am old enough and heaven alone knows that i feel that i am getting older to have been one of those who in early younger days fought for the establishment of a national health service and i did so in a humble capacity <e> <s> in i fought and won my first council election on the issue of a proper health service and the provision of a hospital for my district <e> <s> i am proud of the health service and have no hesitation in saying so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a third time <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord skelmersdale will have a more relaxing time than he has had dealing with ironstone and other matters <e> <s> we are getting back to the soil <e> <s> in moving that this bill be now read a third time i should like to say that i hope that one day in the distant future a government will consolidate and update the allotment legislation which exists <e> <s> there is a need for <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that both the government and the opposition in the house of assembly in gibraltar are completely and utterly opposed to the transfer of sovereignty from britain <e> <s> the only difference of opinion that seems to arise is as to whether representatives of the gibraltar government should take part in the geneva talks <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that extended working hours during daylight might at this very moment be very acceptable to another place <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the interjection by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is exactly what one would expect <e> <s> therefore we are not surprised and we are not surprised that the noble lord the minister himself agrees with it <e> <s> i should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement but i should like to go further and sympathise with him for having to make it because it is at least reactionary and certainly a statement which can be i warn the noble lord about this political dynamite <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say whether with the new boxes it will be easier to get your money back when you cannot get through <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his negative answer to my noble friend lord cledwyn causes concern <e> <s> the government must have an idea of the cost of these committees <e> <s> will he eventually make the house aware of what the total cost is <e> <s> secondly what will the relationship be in the future between community health councils and the new family practitioner committees <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i fully anticipated his answer <e> <s> is he aware that the records to be maintained are quite simple the allotment site itself the total number of plots plots to let or on offer vacant plots waiting lists and notices to improve or notices to quit <e> <s> that is all that is needed <e> <s> it is quite simple quite elementary <e> <s> should any allotment society wish to do it themselves they can do so <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that i have in my hand a quarterly report to a local authority of a joint meeting of allotment tenants representatives and councillors giving all the facts in full detail including financial ones at a later stage <e> <s> so there is no problem whatever and no expense to local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i strongly support the noble lord lord gainford in his tribute to the value of this profession <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that that value is being eroded at present because of severe reductions in services to patients <e> <s> in some areas the reduction has been as high as per cent <e> <s> therefore although we have a valuable service it is being eroded at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord has misunderstood me <e> <s> the reduction in services is due not to a shortage of chiropodists but to the financial restrictions on the use of chiropodists in various services <e> <s> that is the problem <e> <s> i am well aware that there is a shortage of chiropodists <e> <s> however the present reduction in services is due not to that shortage but to financial considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether it is true that the prime ministers reaction to this question was let them eat cake <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that pensioners who receive only a pension and who are not on supplementary benefit will be hit very hard indeed <e> <s> it must be borne in mind that as the noble baroness will be aware the bulk of cataract sufferers are in the older age bracket <e> <s> is she aware that i regard the answer from her brief as both callous and indifferent to the needs of elderly people <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the case what will happen after the change of glasses has been effected and stabilisation has been achieved is that the elderly person will be facing a colossal cost of anything up to or <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that as this is a health question members of the house and myself would welcome the services of an experienced nurse on the government front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he said that workers must price themselves into a job <e> <s> is it a fact then that the government think that the workers should shop around on their bikes <e> <s> is he further aware that what he has said is a certain recipe for considerable industrial unrest <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say whether the government might consider stressing the value of home-grown vegetables and in addition to that give a little more positive effort in the provision of allotment gardens <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that previous policy was to offer the buildings and land of hospitals disposed of to any other government department <e> <s> now the policy seems to be a quick sale and a quick profit <e>", "<cs> there is a point that i should like to raise <e> <s> it was raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i am involved in and live in the greater london area a part of the greater london area which at one time was in the county of kent <e> <s> now we have a london borough which has far greater powers than the magnificent city of norwich which has been reduced to the level of a district council <e> <s> those people who live on the outskirts of greater london and who travel into london and sometimes pay rates in london have the benefit of the county councils whereas in my case my county council will be removed and my local authority will have powers even greater than exist in such cities as norwich <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness give an assurance that the expertise of your lordships house will be secured by consultation in the form of a debate on the green paper after publication <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl tell the house to what extent the government want to extend the privatisation of public toilets <e> <s> this is a matter of great interest to noble peers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness gave the impression that everything was okay and in order in the national health service <e> <s> why then is it that periodically in many areas and this has been going on for some time emergency and out-patient departments are closed putting pressure on other hospitals that are struggling to remain open <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask a question relating to that put by my noble friend <e> <s> would a condition of employment be that the appointed person should have local government experience <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that it is all very well for the government to say that they have met the review body and the nurses but in point of fact what they have done is to give with one hand and to take back with another <e> <s> the charges to nurses for lodging and other expenses are to be increased by per cent <e> <s> thus cancelling out what the nurses will get this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very relieved that this ecclesiastical exchange has finished <e> <s> it rather added to the strain of my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the noble lord doing <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness able to give me a clear and positive assurance that in point of fact the extra monies allocated to the appropriate health authority will not be used as an excuse to reduce their financial allocation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that that is a very poor answer for the which i understand it costs for a question <e> <s> i nearly asked for my money back <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that that answer is not good enough <e> <s> several successive governments have promised to bring in comprehensive legislation based on the thorpe report <e> <s> is he further aware that i have in my possession a letter dated april in which the department of the environment said that following the ministers statement in committee it was considering introducing <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the noble lords reply to me when he quoted from the minister can he assure me that the government have not given up any idea of being radical and reforming or have they just packed it in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this question is in the nature of an educational question <e> <s> is he further aware that all local authorities submit to their councillors at least quarterly reports of allotments let allotments vacant and people on the waiting list <e> <s> to say as the noble lord said on a previous bills third reading that to give this information to the local associations would be at the cost of excessive manpower is absolute nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he has admitted that under legislation local authorities have a statutory obligation to publish an annual report and that is precisely the information i have been asking for <e> <s> bearing in mind the answers that i have received at various times from the department of the environment will he ask his right honourable friend the prime minister to transfer the care of allotments from the department of the environment to the department of agriculture fisheries and food where i am certain that they will have more common sense treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble lord that that was an exceptionally nice answer which is very welcome indeed <e> <s> but is the noble lord aware that there is a tendency for heavy rent increases to be imposed for plots not related to recreational facilities <e> <s> what remedy have plot holders in such cases <e> <s> may i remind the noble lord that there was a case in the high court in november concerning a rent increase of more than per cent <e> <s> when the judge came down in favour of the plot holders <e> <s> can the noble lord tell me this is a very important question what avenue of appeal is there for plot holders <e> <s> can they appeal to the minister when negotiations with the council fail <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not really answered the question <e> <s> let us suppose that a council makes an increase well above what is regarded as reasonable and councils are doing it <e> <s> who on earth can say what is reasonable under such circumstances <e> <s> if the tenants feel that the charges are unreasonable have they the right after going to the council and protesting to come to the minister to appeal <e> <s> that is what i want to know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back again but in point of fact that answer is not at all satisfactory <e> <s> it costs a tremendous amount of money <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that recourse to law costs a tremendous amount of money <e> <s> in the case to which i referred one plot <e>", "<cs> that is the question i am asking in spite of the interruption of the chief whip <e>", "<cs> my lords he should have <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i heard all his answers on television a few days ago when he was interviewed <e> <s> will he tell us how many of the people who comprise this alleged increase are involved in productive industries as opposed to service industries <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that she used the phrase the health authority has a duty to provide services within the resources available <e> <s> is she further aware that this is a common factor in many areas <e> <s> the bexley health district for example next year faces being on the verge of bankruptcy and a severe curtailment of services in an area where there is not an over-supply of hospital accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords what i meant to say was that quoting the bexley health district we are not over-supplied with hospitals but in point of fact the group is on the verge of bankruptcy and services will have to be drastically curtailed in the not too distant future unless further financial provision is made <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that i also wish her a very happy holiday <e> <s> she deserves it because she has been a maid of all work in this house for many months <e> <s> is she further aware that i

happened in norwich it is happening in my health district where good first-class administrators <e>", "<cs> is she aware that first-class administrators are being by-passed by the appointment of outside people and that you cannot run a national health service like marks and spencer <e> <s> in my case in my district <e>", "<cs> a retired colonel has been appointed <e> <s> is the noble baroness

said in his earlier answer that lrt are free to run their business as they think best <e> <s> how does this tie up with the steep increases in fares which are to be made next january and which are obviously a result of government policy <e> <s> if that is not so why are they to be increased <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord advise the house on what has happened to the plans that were produced by the british governments own architects for the development of both these areas <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am very much in favour of homegrown food and will the government give similar encouragement to allotment holders <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the government will show the same enthusiasm for creating jobs throughout the country as they have in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord possibly aware that some of the white lines might be an overflow of whitewash from no <e> <s> downing street <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that considerable sums of money are already being raised by voluntary effort to provide essential equipment in hospitals through the friends organisations <e> <s> the unfortunate fact is that we are losing a considerable amount of income because we are not allowed to sell tobacco <e> <s> in my area we shall lose a year and have to find other means of gambling and so on to raise the money <e> <s> is she further aware that the biggest gamble in the health service at the moment is trying to get an operation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there has been a great deal of wind generated by this matter <e> <s> in point of fact in the london borough of bexley which was under conservative control until very recently we receive a similar publication <e> <s> if such a publication comes from a conservative-controlled body it is apparently not party political propaganda but if it comes from a glc governed by labour it appears that it is party political propaganda <e> <s> is it not time that people sorted themselves out and distinguished between what is information and what is propaganda <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that i agree that so far as the average person is concerned there has been no drop whatever <e> <s> on the other hand i have this from professional sources the number of elderly people seeking tests and treatment has dropped considerably <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that i am not grateful to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> is she further aware that i would accept that there is a cheaper range of glasses i know that the noble baroness has acquired a new pair recently but that these are known as budget spectacles which have been introduced by the profession in order to assist people to get a cheaper type of spectacles <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that i am very concerned about the elderly person who is not on supplementary benefit and whose income is insufficient to meet the cost even of the budget spectacles <e> <s> being honest as elderly people are and wanting to avoid unnecessary expense they are not having the treatment that they should have simply because of the present procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords after three expert speeches i can only comment as a consumer and also perhaps as one who fought for the national health service long before it came into being <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble baroness lady

harry who is flogging spectacles <e>", "<cs> that is so my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that three years ago i was told that there was an acute shortage of chiropodists <e> <s> that is probably not the case today because it is quite easy to have treatment for to a go whereas people on the national health service find that as economy measures are introduced the period before an elderly person gets treatment has now been extended to about three or four months <e> <s> that is a vital matter <e> <s> it is not a question of toe nails it is callouses and other treatments <e> <s> that means that a person is liable to fall or be unable to get about <e> <s> this is a vital service and not the cinderella that it will soon be <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for putting a further supplementary question <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that the home chiropody service is absolutely vital because those are the worst possible cases which need treatment <e> <s> there is a delay in treatment taking place <e> <s> as i have said there is a gap of up to four months between one treatment and another <e> <s> will she ask her right honourable friend to get someone to have a look at this matter i know that it involves a certain amount of investigation because it is vital

parts of london outer london and my district in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that one of the problems posed in the question of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie is the closing of too many sub-post offices which has increased the pressure on others <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl outlined many advantages as a result of bringing in the channel tunnel but has he taken into account the desecration of kent and the enormous amount of traffic that will ensue for the kentish suburbs <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it is utterly futile to talk about the mobility of labour unless adequate rented accommodation at reasonable rents is made available <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am completely innocent about call girls etc

rise in house prices in the london and outer london areas in the south-east is nothing short of a downright scandal and that it is affecting very seriously the social life of many people and particularly young people who wish to get <e>", "<cs> my lords that is all very well <e> <s> how many of those mortgages were granted to young people the payment for which will depend upon a husband and wife working <e> <s> if by chance a child comes along it is an economic disaster <e> <s> in how many cases have there been defaults on mortgages with a building society calling a house in <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i strongly support the plea made by the noble baroness lady masham that teachers representatives should be on this health education authority <e> <s> health education is vitally important when it starts in the primary and secondary schools <e> <s> we have to get away from the surfeit of sausages chips and beans which seems to be the staple fare for many young people today <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot be expected to follow the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> quite frankly it would be very bad for my blood pressure because her views and the views of many of her colleagues in a document that has been published recently are reactionary in the extreme <e> <s> her remarks come badly at a time when we all know that our education system has been deprived of money books and essential equipment <e> <s> the standard of education had been dictated by the amount of money allowed to our schools to such an extent that parents have had to buy books for their children <e> <s> naturally all decent parents want a fair chance for their children some of whom are slow developers <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the point made by my noble friend is the minister not aware that the problem of waiting lists will never be properly solved until adequate steps are taken to provide good accommodation pay and conditions for nurses and a stop is put on the wastage of nhs-trained nurses to the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house why there is a shortage of trained nurses <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that thousands of fully trained nurses are leaving the national health service for the private sector the united states arab countries australia and so on <e> <s> is he also aware that those nurses have been fully trained and have gained their experience in the national health service at the taxpayers expense <e> <s> will he consider passing to his right honourable friend the suggestion that it is about time a levy was made on the private sector and on <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the answer is to offer better pay and better conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that most health authorities seem to regard community health councils as a bit of a nuisance whereas and i think that the minister will agree with me community health councils perform a vital service in protecting consumers interests <e>", "<cs> my lords what has happened to mr richard branson who was appointed by the prime minister to organise this clearing-up <e> <s> he does not seem to be operating <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any possibility of dispatching urgently some of the surpluses to ethiopia and mozambique <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect to the noble lord i submit that my supplementary question was quite in line with the question on the order paper <e> <s> as this is a matter of urgency i think it deserves a better answer <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord who has just sat down i have no interest to declare except perhaps the preservation of some of the most beautiful spots around our coastline <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i have been advised that there is no such thing as administrative staff in the national health service today <e> <s> in my experience under this government everybody seems to be a manager or a deputy manager with resultant chaos <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the westminster hospital site is very valuable from the point of view of development <e> <s> will he give an assurance that the development value of the site will have nothing whatever to do with the hospitals continuance or closure <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it astonishing that the minister will not give an assurance on the financial implications of developing the site for other purposes than a hospital <e> <s> surely an assurance can be given that the only decision that can be made is for the benefit of the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to the supplementary question of the noble baroness lady robson is the minister aware that any move to bring in a national lottery would negative tremendously the amount of voluntary work being put in today which enables a good deal of equipment to be bought for the health service that should be provided by the taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords is there a possibility that such holidays will be reduced due to the utterances of a certain government minister who said that people should give up holidays and go in for private health insurance <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he is saying in fact that there is no extension of facilities the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the question of frequent television advertisements arises in addition to television programmes <e> <s> the government have banned cigarette and tobacco advertising should they not consider banning alcohol advertising <e>", "<cs> my lords on safety for pedestrians may i draw the attention of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord whether he is aware of the disastrous and chaotic conditions which apply due to building work in villiers street between the embankment and the strand <e> <s> the pedestrian not only needs light clothing but he needs to carry hazard lights because of the terrible conditions particularly in wet weather <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that any proposal to close westminster hospital will be met with considerable anger and resentment by all sections of the palace of westminster <e> <s> many of us have received its services and no doubt look forward to continuing to have its support <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to make any narrow party political point unlike the noble lord opposite <e> <s> however will the minister explain to me why with these millions of pounds of additional money that the government have given in some instances wards remain closed or where they have been partially opened the future looks bleak for keeping them in operation <e> <s> why are wards still being closed after all this money has been given <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say who will be responsible at local hospital level for this fantastic scheme of income generation which could be described in other words <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the abolition of ilea is very much involved in this question <e> <s> is she further aware that i have recently received a letter from a former conservative opponent asking me to do my best to assist the house of lords to stop the government going ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords for well over years i have been campaigning for and on behalf of a national health service and for a local hospital <e> <s> one has had a great deal of experience of the national health service at first hand <e> <s> for too long the national health service has been politically kicked around far too much <e> <s> there have been three reorganisations under the present government <e> <s> the last one was the managerial revolution expensive and chaotic <e> <s> there are so many managers in our local hospital that i do not know who runs what <e> <s> it is most difficult and frustrating <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord remember that yesterday i mentioned the drain of nurses to the private sector and overseas <e> <s> i proposed once again that a levy should be imposed to recover costs which might help to give the nurses in the health service a better deal on pay and conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that although as he states figures are dropping as a result of government policy there was a dramatic rise when the present government took over <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one very useful thing the government could do in that year is to bring in revised allotment legislation based on the thorpe report <e> <s> if the minister does not know what the thorpe report is i have a copy and advise him to read it <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say whether parliament will have anything to say in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with other noble lords who have mentioned the extension of charges to dental and eye examinations <e> <s> we still have the right to general examination of the body by a medical practitioner so why exclude teeth and eyes <e> <s> routine examination of the eyes can often yield evidence of disease and referral to a doctor for treatment <e> <s> i have personal experience of this not with myself but with a member of my family <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that already at embankment station where a ticket-activated system is in operation there is far more congestion for those leaving the station than there has ever been and if there was a fire it would be even worse <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that just over years ago i was present in the other place when the health service legislation was passed <e> <s> is he further aware that unfortunately the conservative opposition voted against it and were supported by the british medical association <e>", "<cs> oh yes they did my lords <e> <s> since then they have changed their tune <e> <s> will the minister now give an assurance that the present inquiry into the health service will be revealed to the public first and not at the tory conference as has already been stated <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord explain what will be the position in future of amateur radio which is an important sector <e>", "<cs> i intervene briefly because i referred to this at second reading <e> <s> i consider that these powers are far too sweeping and should be subject to some change <e> <s> i appeal to the minister on the ground that further consideration be given to this issue before the report stage <e> <s> the powers are somewhat sweeping <e> <s> i appeal to the minister at least to consider it and perhaps come back to it at the report stage when we can sort matters out <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lords who spoke from the liberal and labour front benches for what they have said <e>", "<cs> i much appreciate what the minister has said as indeed i appreciated the correspondence that he sent to me <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that to transfer the department of social security from the elephant and castle might conceivably give the present secretary of state a little moral uplift <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there is concern not so much about the role of developers but about that of the minister <e> <s> is he aware that in my own area which is conservative controlled although councillors objected to an application the minister has given permission and as a result the area and particularly sidcup has become a mass of one-bedroom flats which are now becoming an eyesore and the whole district has been changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord very much indeed for his kind remarks and for the offer that he has made which i naturally accept <e> <s> the principle has been accepted <e> <s> perhaps i may say that it is typical of the minister that our exchanges over this matter have been extremely friendly and i thank him for it <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i accept and welcome this amendment <e> <s> it has been rather a long road but i am glad that the government have decided to insert the amendment and in so doing put in legislative form their appreciation of the work of voluntary societies which do far more than some people imagine <e> <s> i do not wish to waste too many words <e> <s> i am very grateful indeed to the minister for the way in which he has dealt with this and i welcome the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say that i recognise that a government amendment has more chance in another place than a back-bench amendment emanating from another side <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the question put by the noble lord lord mellish perhaps i may once again ask the government why they do not charge foreign organisations recruiting nurses in britain and the private sector for the training which is undergone at state expense <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not asking for the nurses to be charged i am asking that the organisations recruiting those nurses be charged <e>", "<cs> my lords the gracious speech states that the government will introduce a bill to provide that football supporters must carry a membership card i presume with a photograph <e> <s> we are told that this will reduce violence at matches <e> <s> the football association is against it as are many thousands of football supporters <e> <s> the proposals will hit the overwhelming majority of visitors to matches who go for enjoyment not the minority who cause trouble <e> <s> the cost will be considerable to the clubs and to individual spectators <e> <s> the idea is put forward mainly by people who have no interest in the sport <e> <s> it will certainly hit many football clubs particularly those in the third and fourth divisions <e> <s> what is not clear at the moment is how clubs in other leagues such as the vauxhall opel league will be affected <e> <s> if they have to issue identity cards they might as well pack up now <e> <s> these clubs have low attendances and their finances are small <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now told by the minister that banks and post offices are likely to issue the cards <e> <s> so far we do not know the cost of such cards but initially it is quite fair to say that anyone can obtain one whether it is a possible troublemaker or otherwise <e> <s> the cost of the card the heavy cost of computers and the problem of delay to crowds are a threat to clubs like norwich city which do not have very large attendances <e> <s> all those matters and many others will be raised when we get the legislation <e> <s> as a political gimmick i forecast a rough journey for the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords that is all right for noble lords who have leave of absence but i was referring to others <e> <s> it is a fact that quite recently one asked me the proper way to the division lobby while others were asking the attendants where the toilets were <e> <s> that sort of thing gets into the press and is bad publicity for the house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government bear in mind that when the british rail channel tunnel scheme comes forward there will be a need to avoid the desecration of kent which at the moment is only too obvious <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i raised the question of travel problems particularly on british rail in in another place <e> <s> at that time people travelled not so much by car but by train today more people travel by road and more people travel by train <e> <s> does the minister agree that something has to be done about a chaotic situation which for many of us who do not use road transport is becoming unbearable <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord wise for two reasons <e> <s> first he is a fellow norwich city supporter and secondly his late father fred was a great personal friend of mine <e> <s> we served in the commons together <e> <s> that dates me a hit but as one expects one does not get younger every day <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his reply gives no comfort to the masses of people in kent who are wholly against this proposal <e> <s> is it not the duty of this house and of the other place fully to discuss these proposals before any attempt is made to bring forward a private bill <e> <s> the noble earl must understand the tremendous opposition to this proposal from among others kent county council and practically all the people of kent <e> <s> it is disgraceful <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some years ago when her majestys stationery office was moved to norwich the co <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord onslow made a remark which deserves to be challenged <e> <s> he referred to the set-to between <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak on this amendment <e> <s> i must disclose a personal interest as indeed most members of this chamber would have to do <e> <s> my point is quite simple <e> <s> this amendment would be quite easy to operate because the great majority of clubs have a special rate of admission for old-age pensioners <e> <s> norwich city for example provide seats for old-age pensioners for <e> <s> that applies to many clubs <e> <s> surely the government with all the necessary information behind them can accept this amendment <e> <s> i hope they will <e> <s> if they do not the whole scheme will become derisory <e>", "<cs> the minister has made heavy weather of the subject <e> <s> i put to him and the committee that supporters clubs are prevalent in every section of football <e> <s> not only are there local football clubs but there is a national association co-ordinating their activities <e> <s> it is a very responsible body <e> <s> i hope that the minister will take that into account when we come to the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the imposition of parking charges at many hospitals is causing serious disruption and delay particularly to patients who are arriving <e> <s> is the minister further aware that the situation at some hospitals is becoming very serious <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he said that district nurses can park free of charge <e> <s> the point is that they and parsons for instance have to get a chit from a porter to take to the ticket barrier when they depart <e> <s> that causes an enormous amount of delay even when the parking is free of charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the leader of the house to remind your lordships that at report stage apart from the mover of the amendment and the minister noble lords may speak only once <e> <s> at least two or three noble lords have spoken twice already <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the present proposals would lead to the devastation of oxleas wood which is at least years old and some experts say dates back to the stone age <e> <s> will the minister consider the fact that in addition the proposals would mean the demolition of houses in plumstead alone and that that is enough to cause a great deal of concern <e> <s> will the minister say whether parliament will have any say in the matter when the scheme is completed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give me a definite answer that parliament will be able to decide the matter in due course <e> <s> will he also confirm that oxleas wood is not definitely to be devastated as it would be under the plans <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord explain in clear language who actually takes a decision in local hospitals to opt out or self-govern if that is the phrase <e> <s> is it not more desirable that where a hospital belongs to a district the inhabitants of the district should decide and not just a few people <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say to what extent british rails channel tunnel link will conflict with the green belt policy especially in kent <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount jumped the gun in speaking because i had already advised the whips that i should be speaking <e> <s> i shall be brief but i speak as one who for many years has been a casual visitor to many grounds and in later years has become a supporter and member of supporters clubs from outside the home teams area <e> <s> this involves a lot of travel to home matches at great expense <e> <s> such supporters respect the law and are decent people <e> <s> all of them are against the proposed scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord explain how on earth district hospitals can operate under market forces and to what extent a policy of operating hospitals under market forces appears in the health service white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that while the government are considering their reply to the report most regional authorities are facing an acute financial crisis <e> <s> beds are being closed by the hundred in many parts of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the serious situation which is developing throughout the country particularly in the south-east is due to the fact that many authorities are trying to balance their budgets <e> <s> therefore in order to make ends meet they are cutting down the number of wards and thereby reducing the number of beds <e> <s> i am particularly concerned about queen marys hospital sidcup where the situation is almost beyond belief <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that apart from the firms mentioned by the noble lord lord monson in his question a large number of health authorities are deliberately as an act of policy delaying payments for bills in a desperate effort to make ends meet <e> <s> does this not involve the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised because it is a well-known fact that health authorities are delaying payment as an act of policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the main reason for hospitals being in the state they are in today is underfunding that is basically the cause of a great deal of the hospitals trouble <e> <s> i agree that the government have given more money to the health service but it is not enough <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain why after government action local government in london is entirely different from that of the rest of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness explain why if the numbers of nurses and doctors have increased waiting lists are getting longer and longer <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister uses the phrase community charge but the questioners referred to poll tax <e> <s> what is the difference <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give us advice that is a little more sensible <e> <s> is he aware that thousands of young couples who want to get married but who wish to avoid unnecessary expenditure in buying a house are desperately searching for houses to let <e> <s> does he agree that there is a shortage of such accommodation throughout the country that the situation is becoming critical and that something should be done about it <e>", "<cs> i know for a fact that many area health authorities in fact the management of the health authorities decided to opt out in principle without committing themselves completely <e> <s> however i want to make the point mainly in regard to district hospitals <e> <s> district hospitals serve the community and are part of the community in which they are situated <e> <s> people regard them as such <e> <s> apart from taking account of the views of staff the people of the district should have their views considered too <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say what effect the payment of the poll tax by nurses has had on recruitment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that british rail has put forward three or four schemes which have blighted many areas in kent <e> <s> is he also aware that british rail has bought many homes in north kent and that many people in kent are unable to sell their properties and move out due to the lack of certainty that exists <e> <s> the present lack of decision reflects no credit on the government or indeed on british rail <e> <s> the whole set-up is a shambles and a disgrace <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am delighted at the news that the noble lord has given is he aware that it is vitally important that the views of the community health councils should be regarded by regional and other authorities with greater care than they sometimes are at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for reading her brief so accurately <e> <s> as regards chiropody i suggest that considerable hardship is arising in the national health service <e> <s> chiropody is an easy service to cut and cuts are being made <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that chiropody does not mean only the cutting of toenails but includes also the treatment for callouses and corns <e> <s> is she also aware that a wait of three months or no treatment at all means considerable hardship for a number of elderly women who have suffered and who are still suffering through lack of mobility <e> <s> why should those people have to suffer <e> <s> i accept that the noble baroness has given the facts but the fact is that cuts are taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords there may be more chiropodists but many of them are operating in the private sector <e> <s> if one cannot afford to a month one has to do without <e> <s> that is the position <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the widespread closure of beds in hospitals throughout the country is one of the main factors in the situation <e>"]
