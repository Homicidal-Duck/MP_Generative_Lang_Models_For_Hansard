["<cs> my lords i venture to speak for the first time in this house with considerable misgivings and much diffidence if only because with the passage of time one becomes more particularly aware of ones inadequacy <e> <s> i have listened to debates in the past it may comfort noble lords that i have not intervened and i am very much aware of the high standards of debate which are normally attained and to which i feel i can in no way do justice <e> <s> however i have felt that i might speak today avoiding politically controversial issues and major strategic questions to comment on a special situation that of fuel distribution problems in terms of the present crisis in the more remote rural areas <e> <s> this has been touched on by the noble viscount who preceded me but there may perhaps be some more to say about it <e> <s> i shall confine myself in a somewhat parochial way to that part of the country where i live northumberland <e> <s> there is a general feeling that the current crisis in this part of the country has so far affected us with above average severity <e> <s> it is i suppose natural in situations of this kind that the problems which affect us directly loom more severely than those which affect our neighbours <e> <s> at the same time i think there is some justification for believing that this is true <e>"]
