["<cs> my lords it is something of a relief to find a subject after some eight <e>", "<cs> my lords the position was well outlined by the noble viscount lord hanworth in his opening words to this debate <e> <s> i too share the concerns of the union representatives which have been mentioned by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> the points that i have to make will i hope serve to emphasise the very great concerns that have been expressed in this matter <e> <s> but before i go into the main parts of my speech i should declare two interests <e> <s> i am a potential beneficiary of my companys pension plan and therefore have somewhat of a private interest in this matter and secondly i have been a pensions consultant for the past years <e>", "<cs> this is a technical amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord banks has outlined the position very clearly and accurately <e> <s> the discharge as it is currently drafted is inadequate <e> <s> legal <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking tenth on a tightly-drawn topic has as i am sure your lordships will agree its drawbacks <e> <s> it will lead to some repetition and for that i apologise <e> <s> i should also like to say that when i was asked to join the committee it was with some trepidation that i agreed to serve because tax and equality of treatment for women is your lordships will surely agree a potential hornets nest <e>", "<cs> my lords i first apologise for the lateness of my addition to the list of speakers tonight <e> <s> i am doubly rewarded in that i speak <e>", "<cs> may i just say that i agree with the noble lord lord swann that his is a modest and innocuous amendment nevertheless it is important as the noble baroness has just said <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment does not wish to rely solely on statutory release from the liability but is seeking an active disclaimer from individuals when they opt out from a personal pension <e> <s> let us add some figures to the numbers of people who die at a relatively young age <e> <s> if people die in their s and s we are talking of something in the region of billion worth of death benefits payable to dependants excluding widows pensions which add a further billion plus <e> <s> so quite a lot of money is at stake and therefore i think that this is an important amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few quick words in support of this amendment <e> <s> i have been in discussion with the institute of chartered accountants for scotland who are very concerned at the lack of legal immunity for the recognised professional bodies and i am able to confirm and support the noble lord lord benson in his views about the other institutes and faculties of actuaries the law society and so on who are equally concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> a and also to amendment no <e> <s> a which is also linked with this group <e> <s> i have put forward this amendment for the sake of clarity and in support of the front bench even though my noble friend is moving his own amendment in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords if harmonisation of lawn-mower noise levels has occupied what many might regard as a quite disproportionate amount of the european communitys time and effort the prospect of harmonising an area as vast and as complex as social security would no doubt take us into the nd century and beyond <e> <s> but in a more serious vein i should not want that rather irreverent sentiment to obscure or detract from the commissions efforts to stimulate thought and discussion about member states social security systems not before time in your sub-committees view <e>", "<cs> my lords before making what will be a modest contribution to the debate i have three tasks to perform <e> <s> first i should like to thank the noble lord lord ezra for initiating this important debate which will be well read in europe and the united kingdom <e> <s> secondly i congratulate my noble friend lord rees on his maiden speech it is a great relief when it is done and we bid him welcome <e> <s> thirdly i must declare an interest <e> <s> i am a director of a financial services company that is at the forefront of the expansion into europe and intends to take full advantage of the liberalisation of the internal market <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by declaring an interest <e> <s> i am the managing director of a subsidiary of the hong kong and shanghai banking corporation <e> <s> i am of course proud to be connected with that group but the views that i express this afternoon are mine and mine alone <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by declaring an interest in that i run an investment management company <e> <s> depending on which expert you wish to listen to the proposals on the pension scheme amendments will either benefit those involved or not <e> <s> i welcome the bulk of the clauses which are proposed to deal with pension schemes <e> <s> however i have some reservations <e> <s> i wish to speak solely to clause <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend the minister for his comments <e> <s> it is always a relief to hear that we have reached a situation where we can discuss pensions <e> <s> perhaps i can look forward to discussing this topic further with him in <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is a difficult area <e> <s> the committee i am sure agrees with the concept of increasing pensions and payments <e> <s> we should all like to have as much provided as possible <e> <s> however there must be a limit because of the cost <e> <s> my noble friend lord mottistone has referred to the costs of the exercise and the ruling of the european court <e> <s> that will add perhaps another to per cent <e> <s> to the pension costs if the worst or rather the greatest liability is caused by that decision <e>", "<cs> i was interested in that last comment <e> <s> presumably certain highly paid people are more likely to receive increases than others <e> <s> i can understand that being a problem <e> <s> i can also understand some of the merits of saying that the surplus should be spread straight across the board so that everyone has a slice <e> <s> in the real world if one provides it right across the board it will be spread very thinly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> in my view he has given a most helpful reply <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend the minister and pleased to hear that the survey is being brought forward in the manner that he has described <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
