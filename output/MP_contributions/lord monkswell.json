["<cs> my lords you may be aware that there are two types of maiden <e> <s> there is the english version which is the sweet young thing you want to embrace and there is the scottish version which embraces you with daggers <e> <s> earlier we heard the approved english version <e> <s> i sincerely hope that my contribution this afternoon will not be the scottish version <e>", "<cs> considering the learned gentlemen speaking in this debate i rise with some trepidation to support this amendment from the point of view of a lay member <e> <s> i want to suggest that one of the major functions of the investigating committee will be to advise people who have complained of the complete circumstances with regard to the regulations as their complaint is seen by those regulations <e> <s> it is hoped that this will give rise to the complainant withdrawing the complaint <e> <s> should that process not be satisfactory to the complainant it is certain that an ordinary member of the public will feel aggrieved that his case has not been heard by the full disciplinary committee <e> <s> as a very junior lay member of this committee i would hope that your lordships would consider this amendment very favourably <e>", "<cs> my lords to start with in all honesty i must declare a slight vested interest in this debate in that my employer might be involved in machinery that would be ancillary to the disposal of straw <e> <s> but having said that i can say that my particular specific employment with that firm is in a field that is not directly related <e> <s> therefore i feel that i can speak without any constraint in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene before the noble lord sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read with interest the debates that your lordships had in this chamber on the subject of the bill as it was then during its passage through the house last year <e> <s> i have also read admittedly only in the past hour or so the report by sir cyril <e> <s> i have not as yet because i heard about it only a few moments ago had the ability to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just finish this point <e> <s> we are talking about legislation which has been on the statute book continuously since under the heading of temporary provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the intervention of the noble lord lord elton <e> <s> however i find this very curious <e> <s> i am trying to understand how <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read the act <e> <s> so far as i can gather my understanding is that an exclusion order can be served on someone who for example lives in birmingham to make him go to northern ireland <e> <s> am i wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords then i am thankful for that intervention <e> <s> i must admit i appear to be labouring under a misapprehension <e> <s> the powers under these acts appear not to apply to the secretary of the state forcing someone to live where he does not wish to live <e> <s> is that the correct interpretation of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i must admit that i appear to be labouring under a misapprehension <e> <s> i apologise to the house if that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord elton for giving way at this point <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down could he answer the following point <e> <s> i should like to say to the house in passing that i apologise if any inconvenience and upsetting of the normal channels has been forthcoming <e> <s> i make the point that i shall seek to pursue my case if the noble lord gives me the answer that he would fail to withdraw the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord gregson and his colleagues on the committee for bringing this most excellent report before us <e> <s> i hope i shall take only a few moments of your lordships time to stress a few of the recommendations that they make from my point of view as someone who works if i can put it like this in the guts of british engineering in the guts of a firm in british engineering <e>", "<cs> my lords having read the bill that is before us i had a dream the other night <e> <s> i dreamed that we considered the bill this afternoon and this evening and having considered it we duly threw it out we refused it a second reading and we threw it back at the other chamber <e> <s> then we did something ourselves we brought forward our own bill a very simple bill <e> <s> it said that on nd may there shall be glc and metropolitan county elections as well as shire county elections in this country <e> <s> it is interesting to reflect that this house has the constitutional authority to do such things but in fact we all know that it would not do them <e> <s> that may be one of the reasons so many of us want to see this place abolished <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this particular amendment because i believe that the government do not appreciate the situation that we are trying to present from this side of the committee <e> <s> we are in committee and by convention this chamber seeks in committee to revise and improve bills which come before us <e> <s> the argument we have heard this afternoon presumes on the governments point of view that we are engaged in activities which wholly have to do with wrecking this particular piece of legislation <e> <s> i hope that the government will take on board that we on this side of the committee or should i say that i from my point of view look on this stage of the proceedings and deliberations on this bill from the point of view of improving the bill rather than seeking to wreck it <e>", "<cs> we have had one occasion this evening which has disturbed us on this side of the committee very much <e> <s> i take great personal exception to the suggestion that we are engaged in filibustering <e>", "<cs> i think that noble lords have had some experience of my contributions <e> <s> if i can keep my contributions short i shall do so <e> <s> if the realities of the situation demand that i take some time to explain them to your lordships i am sure that your lordships will appreciate that <e> <s> it ill behoves members of the government benches to suggest that we on this side when engaged in deliberations which are trying to improve this bill and on many sides of the committee there have been criticisms about it should <e>", "<cs> no i am not engaged in a filibuster <e> <s> i am trying to explain the practical realities and difficulties of this bill and the reasons why the bill should not come into effect for one year beyond the period that the government seek to dictate <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl give way <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord gowrie has repeated the fallacy of the noble lord lord elton which i sought to correct <e> <s> the activities of the employees of these authorities are not solely <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for finally giving way <e> <s> the point i want to make is that he has raised what to my mind is a very dangerous argument which suggests that the whole validity of local government and dare i say it national government in this country is at question <e> <s> the implication of his argument is that no specialist function whether it be education housing or social services should be the province of the elected local authority but should be the province of a specialist body <e> <s> can your lordships imagine the implications for local government in this country if we were to have different committees of the council operating completely independently authorities in their own right for all the functions of local government <e> <s> we should have a myriad of committees <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will forgive my correction the point i was trying to make and i think i made it in my intervention earlier was that the arguments being used on the noble lords side of the chamber would seek to deny the validity of local government and by that i meant district councils <e> <s> i raised the spectre of education housing and social services each being separate organisations not coming to a council at the head <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the minister particularly for his opening remarks when he advised the committee that i had a very strong case <e> <s> however i must take issue with the noble lord the minister in the sense that he repeated i think on more than one occasion the concept of sensible administration <e> <s> when one is talking about the organisation and the relationship between local government and the police one is not talking about only an administrative relationship <e> <s> one is talking about a very close relationship that involves the provision of finance advice on the feelings of the local community with regard to police operational matters advice from the chief constable to the police authority about operational and other matters as well as a very intricate relationship with the home office <e> <s> we are not talking about an administrative function of local government <e>", "<cs> i rise with a little hesitation on a subject of which i know very little but i will introduce into the debate an aspect which i know rather more about and of which i have some experience that is the effect of the proposals of the bill on the teams in terms of individuals and specialists <e> <s> here i must bring into the debate my experience in engineering <e> <s> your lordships will be aware that in the engineering industry there have been numerous massive factory <e>", "<cs> i rise in response to a comment which i think i heard the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter make from the benches opposite a few moments ago <e> <s> he seemed to imply that employees of the glc and of the metropolitan counties were so to speak over-paid <e> <s> i think that i am right in saying that the employment situation in local authorities is rather different from that appertaining in private industry <e> <s> in private industry it is quite possible for an employer to over-pay one of his employees with no harmful effects to himself <e> <s> in fact i am sure that we are all aware of numbers of people employed in british industry who are paid over-inflated salaries <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope no one will object to my entering this debate <e> <s> i arrived at a late stage but no doubt the house will accept my apologies for that <e> <s> my reason for speaking in this debate is that there are a number of issues that an englishman can raise in this debate which might bear listening to <e> <s> the first is that i must declare my own attitude to taxation in this country <e> <s> to my mind there are two taxes which are basically progressive in that they tax the rich who are more capable of paying those taxes more heavily than they tax those who are poorer and less able to pay the taxes <e> <s> those two taxes are income tax and the rates <e> <s> one is a tax on income the other is effectively a tax on property and wealth <e>", "<cs> my lords on a preliminary reading of this amendment it would be quite easy to use it as a vehicle to attack the government <e> <s> i resist that temptation because on a further reading of the amendment one can see that it is a very practical and sensible suggestion to put to the government to adopt within this bill so as i would think to do two specific things <e> <s> the first is to ensure that there is a discussion between government the glc and the boroughs in london about how activities can be carried on to ensure the best take-up of the welfare benefits <e> <s> i would hope and i am sure that the government would accept that it is the wish of the government that all the welfare benefits that are available should be fully taken up for the benefit of the people of this country <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps he will clarify one point for me <e> <s> he mentioned hidden cross-subsidy as though it were some monstrous evil <e> <s> that may be so but can he explain to the committee whether it is the fact that it is hidden which is monstrous or that it exists at all <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord belstead has not answered my question and i think it would be useful for the committee to know <e>", "<cs> i take note of the noble lords comment <e>", "<cs> i think that the governments position is still unclear as to whether they are against hidden cross-subsidy or against cross-subsidy <e>", "<cs> my lords i crave your lordships indulgence for arriving so very late at this debate <e> <s> i must also tender my apology to <e>", "<cs> my lords following such a magnificent contribution from the previous speaker i shall curtail the remarks i was going to make and make just one point <e> <s> if one looks at the difference in the way that the leader of the labour party neil kinnock has handled the liverpool situation compared with the way that the prime minister tends to handle the problems which face her it is a revelation to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to rise to thank the minister for repeating the statement which was made in another place <e> <s> it is true to say that there has been a great deal of discussion about the financial implications of these board and lodging regulations as well as their legal implications <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether there has been any consideration of the democratic rights of the individuals affected particularly with reference to their ability to vote for representatives who will represent them <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike previous speakers i rise to oppose this renewal of the prevention of terrorism temporary provisions act <e> <s> to explain my position and to persuade your lordships to support my case i shall endeavour to give some practical reasons and also present a constitutional argument which also has wider practical justification <e> <s> one of the problems with which we are faced is some peoples lack of appreciation of what the prevention of terrorism act actually does <e> <s> of course this does not apply to your lordships but for those who are not so well informed and who are listening to the debate or who will read the record in <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the contrary to the noble lords last statement is true <e> <s> this act or a similar one has been in existence for years and it has not yet succeeded in preventing terrorism <e>", "<cs> not-content <e>", "<cs> my lords as a gas consumer when i receive my quarterly gas bill it is one sheet of paper <e> <s> it usually gives me a little tremble of the heart before i open the envelope and read it because there is always a little doubt as to whether i can afford to pay that bill <e> <s> but in general terms i can budget for that expense and within a reasonable margin i can anticipate what the bill will be <e> <s> when one has a bill of pages one almost has a heart attack because one knows that we are all going to pay very heavily for that bill <e>", "<cs> the question before us this evening is whether we should beat children or whether we should not <e> <s> we all feel revulsion when we learn in the media or in newspapers of cases of children being beaten by their parents their guardians or someone who abducts them <e> <s> surely it is a nonsense for us to be reviled by that and yet at the same time consider by official sanction legally to give authority to some members of our society to beat children in an official capacity <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for giving way <e> <s> she made reference to the fact that english-speaking countries engage in corporal punishment <e> <s> does that include the united states of america <e>", "<cs> i must admit to taking a slightly different point of view from the penultimate speaker <e> <s> in fact i live in manchester <e> <s> my wife teaches there and she is a member of the union which has been at the forefront of the poundswick dispute <e> <s> unfortunately from the point of view of our own family relationships she has taken one side and i have taken the other <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i should like to mention two things which i do not think have been highlighted so far <e> <s> the first is the implications for the local authority in terms of the local transport network which feeds the airports involved <e> <s> let us think of the consumers in particular the business user for example he may want to fly from manchester to hamburg <e> <s> he applies to his local travel agent or his firms transport department and says book me a flight to hamburg <e> <s> it will probably book him from manchester to london and then from london on to hamburg <e> <s> the operator and the airport will accept that as good business and think no more about it <e> <s> the businessman will also accept it though he will probably bellyache about the fact that he has to transfer flights at another airport <e> <s> that is the type of thing that the local authority may pick up <e> <s> it can identify the amount of usage in the areas in which the businessmen are travelling and highlight the need for direct interconnecting flights between business centres <e> <s> the same sort of point applies to tourism <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down i am a little curious as to the attitude of the government <e> <s> having listed three groups of people to be consulted they then say that it would be unfair on others if the list was extended <e> <s> there seems to be some divergence of view here <e> <s> either you want a list of those who should be consulted or you feel that wide consultation should take place <e> <s> to circumscribe it and to refuse effectively the views of members of the committee who suggest other worthy groups that should be consulted seems to be neither flesh nor fowl <e> <s> i wonder how the government would react if one were to suggest taking a different view of the list and that rather than listing any groups at all there should be words written into the bill to the effect that the secretary of state shall consult as he sees fit <e> <s> that would effectively nullify any possibility of some groups being identified and others not being identified <e> <s> perhaps the minister will respond to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the minister on his promotion and to thank him for his statement this afternoon <e> <s> i should like to reiterate a couple of points that have been made already by previous speakers and also to raise two others <e> <s> the first is that it would appear the government are somewhat hypocritical in their attitude to law-breaking in the sense that normally their attitude to breaking the law is to throw people in gaol the prison population is evidence of that and yet here we have evidence that criminal acts have been committed and nobody is even being brought to trial let alone punished <e> <s> the second point concerns the apparent unfairness of the treatment to be accorded to the eighth defendant who will not receive an <e>", "<cs> my lords a broad philosophy for defence may be divided into four elements all of which are necessary and linked together one an effective shield two a sharp sword three strong arms and four a sound body and mind <e> <s> i intend to highlight some problems vulnerabilities and limitations with regard to the defence of this realm and then briefly to summarise the effect on these four elements <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my contribution will not take too long but i want to raise some issues of national defence national economic security democracy and human rights and also to ponder the question of whether we have government management incompetence or government management with secret objectives <e> <s> then i shall comment on one of the specific issues that is likely to come from this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his detailed reply <e> <s> it gives me an opportunity to raise one of the concerns which i had hoped to raise later tonight but which his reply forces me to mention now that is the merit payments that have been suggested by the secretary of state in the press <e> <s> i am concerned at the implication that a scheme for merit payments may apply within a particular school rather than on the basis of a national scheme independently assessed <e> <s> the ministers reply implied that it would not be reasonable for the secretary of state to consult individual local authorities about changes that he may put forward <e> <s> that raises the problem of assessment schemes which may relate to individual schools as opposed to nationally <e> <s> that will have important implications down to the local education authority level <e>", "<cs> if i may clarify the point for the minister the response he gave to the noble lord lord mcintosh was that it was not reasonable for the government to consider consulting individual local education authorities and that it would be acceptable for him to consult local authority associations <e> <s> if the government are considering schemes that will apply to individual schools the local education authority as opposed to the local authority associations will be directly concerned <e> <s> that is why i raise the point now <e> <s> i recognise that it may require study and consideration <e> <s> i should welcome that response <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment of the noble lord lord henderson for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that while researching the background to the present bill i had difficulty in finding what the current arrangements for teachers pay and conditions were <e> <s> i am sure that if they were contained in an order before noble lords it would be much easier <e>", "<cs> i feel that we have inadvertently skipped over something which i feel is very important <e> <s> if it was a mistake on my part in not joining the debate at the right time i apologise unreservedly to the committee <e> <s> when the noble baroness rose to address the committee on this subject she mentioned amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> she said that she was speaking to them all <e> <s> i make a very inmportant distinction between amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would seek to allow the secretary of state i agree that this has been overtaken by events but if i can make this point <e>", "<cs> we have had a bit of procedural difficulty but i hope i can now make the contributions which i intended to make before <e>", "<cs> while i address my remarks to amendment no <e> <s> i hope the committee will understand if i make some remarks about amendment no <e> <s> which overtook events and amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene in this two-way debate <e> <s> it appears to me and i am open to correction by the minister that with the negative procedure the order has to be laid and then there has to be a period of delay during which a prayer can be laid <e> <s> i believe that the period is days <e> <s> that is what one might call an automatic procedure <e> <s> with the affirmative procedure the order having been made it can be debated within the week within seven days as opposed to waiting days <e> <s> that decision will rest with the governments business managers <e> <s> i cannot speak for the whips on this side of the committee but i cannot conceive of a situation in which if there was a requirement to pass it quickly they would resist the governments wish to hold a debate on this subject within a week of laying the order <e>", "<cs> my lords in replying to this debate i thank those who have contributed <e> <s> the first matter to which i must reply is the point made by the noble lord lord belstead that it would not be the intention of the secretary of state when making an order to change very much the way that teachers pay is arrived at <e> <s> we are faced with the problem that this bill gives the secretary of state subject to the approval of parliament absolute power <e> <s> the secretary of state could completely tear up the way that teachers pay has been determined and developed over the last years and could start completely from scratch <e> <s> i do not suggest that that is the intention of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i must declare an interest in this debate in that currently i work in trafford park and have done for the past years <e> <s> i and my colleagues in the labour movement have been appalled by what has happened to trafford park over the years <e> <s> in my experience of working there for a number of years i have seen terrible developments <e> <s> i have seen a reduction in the number of men and women employed in trafford park <e> <s> in my own factory there has been a per cent <e> <s> reduction in the labour force over the past eight years <e>", "<cs> it appears to me that the constraints under which a marine nature reserve would be set up under the three-mile limit must include provision for shipping and fisheries <e> <s> shipping does not suddenly occur outside three miles it occurs inside that distance <e> <s> therefore provision must exist already for shipping and fisheries to be taken into account when determining the area of a marine nature reserve <e> <s> surely the same constraints as apply within three miles would automatically apply within miles <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the noble earl the previous speakers and also the noble viscount lord colville of culross for his very illuminating report <e> <s> i do not want unduly to prolong the debate so i shall not elaborate on the horrendous damage that the prevention of terrorism act does to our constitution and to the civil liberties of the citizen <e> <s> i shall highlight some aspects of the report by the noble viscount and then explain the positive effect of doing away with the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to declare a special interest and following so closely the noble lord lord bauers speech it becomes even more important that i do so <e> <s> i am an engineer who has worked in manufacturing industry for the last years <e> <s> i am also a proud member of the manufacturing union auew/tass so i take on board lord bauers strictures about special pleading <e> <s> i realise that i have to be very careful when looking at the terms of reference of the debate <e> <s> i recognise that we need to look at the alternatives to manufacturing industry with regard to the economic prosperity of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intend to contribute but following the remarks of the noble earl i wish to make a few very quick points <e> <s> they are really in support of his contentions about the use of the engine required for the european fighter aircraft <e> <s> i wish to point out that one of my reasons for supporting his arguments is my membership of the manufacturing union tass <e> <s> i point out also that that union has a very good record when it comes to supporting aerospace projects <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the problems that we have in parliament is that the trades descriptions act does not apply <e> <s> in this connection the correct title of this bill would be the poll tax bill and its longer title would be the legalisation of tax evasion by the rich <e> <s> the bill results from a problem which was created by her majestys government and we can only look at a couple of the other problems also created by the government to see where it might lead us <e> <s> i refer to two specific cases the miners dispute and the current teachers dispute both of which were created by her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard the ministers reply that the government were not intending to withdraw the bill will the minister nevertheless give an assurance that the bill is capable of being amended to impose an overriding duty of conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank the noble baroness lady turner of camden for bringing the bill before us <e> <s> its timing is very apposite <e> <s> the hour is late and i fear that if i were to cover all the good points of the bill we should be here far too long <e> <s> therefore with the leave of the house i shall concentrate my remarks on two particular aspects of the bill <e> <s> the first matter concerns clause ci which refers to the information that a company should supply to the trade unions about <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may add another word on behalf of students <e> <s> we have heard about their financial problems <e> <s> i should like to say a few words about the administrative side of the matter <e> <s> i remember from my student days that it is a difficult existence <e> <s> one is studying hard and trying to take on board sophisticated and difficult academic and technical knowledge <e> <s> whenever we can we should try to relieve students of the burden of the normal trials and tribulations of living in our complex society <e> <s> it has been said that one virtually needs to have a university degree in order to fill in forms <e> <s> we should not ask students to fill in more forms <e>", "<cs> in discussing this aspect one of my concerns is the integrity of parliament in regard to the community outside <e> <s> if we persist in having in bills proposals that are not in accord with reality the perception of the population outside this place will be to hold us in ridicule <e> <s> they will either do that or say that parliament is trying to hoodwink them <e> <s> neither of those two alternatives is very satisfactory for parliament <e> <s> therefore i hope that the government will reconsider their whole attitude in regard to the nomenclature <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord proposing that we should now have a window tax involved with this bill <e> <s> that is the implication <e> <s> he is saying that a house will become uninhabitable when the windows are knocked out and they are boarded up therefore it will not be liable for tax <e> <s> that was exactly the result of the window tax <e> <s> surely it is ridiculous <e>", "<cs> we appear to be introducing a rather large subject in a rather short bill <e> <s> i fear that the whole concept of uninhabitable property is a minefield for the government <e> <s> i should like to have some clarification about the kind of criteria that the government would use to judge whether or not a property is uninhabitable <e> <s> that is my first point <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to pay tribute to the noble baroness lady young for her work at the foreign and commonwealth office where i am sure she was a moderating influence on the dare i say <e> <s> lunatic right tendencies within her own party <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble lord lord glenarthur on achieving his new position <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government take notice in their review of the usefulness the efficiency and the international commonality of having may day as the first day of may and not the first monday in may <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank the noble lord lord peston for introducing this important subject for this afternoons debate <e> <s> i am sure that we are all learning from the contributions that have been made <e> <s> i should like to compliment both maiden speakers on their admirable portrayal of the two strands within the tory party the one-nation philosophy and the radical right philosophy <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear more from both wings <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall not take up too much time which is running short <e> <s> perhaps i may say that it would be very easy simply to castigate the government for their lack of emphasis on national defence in that they have allowed the merchant navy to decline to such a sorry level <e> <s> however i do not think that there is anything to be gained simply by pointing the finger and laying blame even though it may fall squarely upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to compliment both the maiden speakers this evening <e> <s> it seems only yesterday that i made my own maiden speech and i know what they have been through <e> <s> i can remember what they have been through <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord wyatt for introducing this debate <e> <s> unfortunately it is rather late at night but i suppose we should not really blame him for the timing <e> <s> it is probably the work of the so-called usual channels which has led to our debating this important bill so late at night <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the remarks of and the amendment proposed by my noble friend lady birk <e> <s> i suggest that the deletion of the subsection will confer benefits on the holders of copyright <e> <s> it will prevent the restriction of advantage that would accrue to them from the provision of subsection that <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that we are all in agreement that the object of this exercise is to ensure that this piece of land stays as a public open space <e> <s> all that remains is for us to ensure how best that can be done <e> <s> i was brought to my feet by the phrase used by the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes when she described her position and that of westminster city council <e> <s> she used the words safe in our hands <e> <s> i am afraid that those words straight away got my back up because they made me think about what has happened to the national health service in the hands of the present conservative government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i am under a misapprehension if that is true <e> <s> i maintain my position as regards the situation to which the present government have brought the national health service <e> <s> i think one should bear in mind their philosophy which is to privatise virtually anything that is in public ownership they are a government who are the embodiment of an enterprise culture which takes as its philosophy get rich quick while you can <e> <s> i believe that those same values are held by the conservative ruling party in westminster city council <e>", "<cs> that is exactly the point which i am making <e> <s> the church may plan and hope to build on the site but it cannot build on it unless westminster city council and the government give their permission <e> <s> that would seem to me to be the ideal way of ensuring that it remains as a public open space <e> <s> on the other hand the people who may want to develop the site should not have the planning control <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will comment on the position that if copyright did not exist for documents under crown privilege there would be a risk of documents purporting to be acts of parliament or court proceedings being published by commercial publishers for profit <e> <s> they would not be the correct works in their entirety and it would therefore lead the public into misapprehension as to the correct legal position <e> <s> i hope that i have made myself clear <e>", "<cs> i too should like to lay down a marker <e> <s> i apologise to the committee straight away for coming into this rather late <e> <s> i have in fact tabled some amendments on the clauses that we shall speak to as the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth said later tonight <e> <s> i admit that that is terribly late for our deliberations on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords what assurance can the minister give that central government funding of polytechnics will be any better than local authority funding of polytechnics given that it is the governments restrictions on local authority funding which are causing the problems to start with <e>", "<cs> i was not going to contribute to this section of the debate but i have been forced to my feet because earlier speakers have suggested that design right protection is too strong rather than the other way round <e> <s> it is my contention that the design right protection is in fact too weak for the original manufacturer <e> <s> be that as it may we shall obviously come to that sort of detail in the discussion of <e>", "<cs> i welcome the support given to the amendment by my noble friends <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord mottistone for chipping in on this debate <e> <s> it obviously saves time when we are discussing broadly similar things to discuss several amendments together <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord howie for his support in objecting to subsections a and d <e> <s> i note the wish of the noble and learned lord lord hailsham to reconcile the rights of designers with the rights of consumers <e> <s> the argument is that he thinks that the bill achieves that aim while i believe that the bill as written does not <e> <s> no doubt we shall carry on this argument to the end of our days <e>", "<cs> i think it would make sense if i spoke to my amendment which is the next one to give the minister an opportunity to reply to both matters at once <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> az seeks to provide a simplified definition of the period of design protection and give a reasonable period of protection <e> <s> i must admit straight away that i cribbed the words from the noble lord lord mottistone in his amendment <e>", "<cs> the argument that i am trying to put forward is that if we give the original manufacturer the design right protection for years not only shall we save the problems of litigation which i mentioned earlier but we shall also create an environment where the manufacturer will seek to provide to the customer a high-quality product that will last for a long period of time <e> <s> at the moment all the pressures in the market place are to operate on a short timescale to produce cheap and shoddy goods which will not last a long time and if we pass the bill unamended that will continue <e> <s> they may last for a year or months which will be sufficient to cover the warranty period of months <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that until the <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i think it will be useful if i move it because the thread of the argument flows through <e> <s> i hope that i shall not take too long <e> <s> this is a much shorter speech than my earlier ones <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply and i also apologise for not picking up the thread of the debate and the response which he gave earlier <e> <s> i think it is useful for me to advise the committee of the continuity of the thread of my amendment and the reasons for it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down if that is the right phrase i wish to make one point <e> <s> my concern is slightly separate from that of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> it seems to me that the clause would give a reverse way of reducing copyright <e> <s> i am thinking of the example of a pop-up book a book in which parts of the page come up to form a three-dimensional article <e> <s> it could be construed that an action could be taken in regard to that by saying that the book which would normally be considered copyright was an article to which design right applied <e> <s> that would seem to be a mechanism by which something which we would accept as copyright would lose copyright and have a lower right attached to it <e> <s> the clause needs to be looked at and i am glad that the minister has agreed to do so <e>", "<cs> i did not intervene earlier because i thought that the minister would take up the point made by the noble lord lord mottistone that licences of right currently available in the pharmaceutical industry will no longer be available <e> <s> one reason for that i believe is the intense aggravation between the parties that is generated by the matter of licences of right <e> <s> it is feared that acrimony had business practice and bad law will be injected into manufacturing industry in an area that is already fairly difficult as between original equipment manufacturers and component manufacturers <e> <s> to force parties who are already not on the best of terms into a contract is a recipe for conflict <e> <s> i hope that the minister can respond in some way to these concerns <e>", "<cs> i have interpreted the amendment slightly differently in the sense that i presumed that we had a misprint in the second line and that design registration should read design right <e> <s> it seems to me that if the clause were agreed to there would be no incentive for a parasitical parts manufacturer to approach the original manufacturer for a licence of right because he could gaily carry on producing the goods <e> <s> it would then be up to the original manufacturer to challenge him in the courts <e>", "<cs> i too should like to be associated with the sentiments that have been expressed <e> <s> if the government in an emergency situation needed to take the sort of action in question i am sure that there would be no hesitation in granting them that power <e> <s> in that respect i think there are amendments already down for clause which will confer that capability in a free-standing fashion <e>", "<cs> i must pick up the minister on one point <e> <s> he says that if there should be an urgent need for extra supplies of a particular component the government may have to go elsewhere <e> <s> surely that need should be able to be foreseen and written into the original contracts for the supply of the components <e> <s> it would seem to me very strange if the ministry of defence negotiates a contract on the basis of a limited supply without any provision in that contract for increasing the supply <e> <s> i must admit that if that is the case i am utterly appalled because if we did get into an emergency situation how would we ensure that we increased the production of the components that were required in an emergency <e>", "<cs> i rise again on the subject of safety of the consumer and the public at large and i put this forward in all sincerity <e> <s> today it has come through very clearly from the government benches that the whole thrust of their line in this bill is to give the opportunity for supply of spare parts from any source <e> <s> it has not come through clearly from reading the bill that that is the governments implication and i wonder whether it has been clear to the various bodies which should and would be interested in safety <e>", "<cs> i must respond to that <e> <s> the first response is unequivocally that the vast majority of parts manufacturers in this country do a magnificent job and they produce quality components <e> <s> i think here particularly of the proprietary manufacturers <e> <s> i shall not list the names but we all know them <e> <s> they are the people who have a proprietary product which they supply to original equipment manufacturers and also through retail outlets <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene at such a late hour but i wish to make two very quick points <e> <s> first i hope that the government can come up with some mechanism whereby the licence of right provision can be done away with <e> <s> there has been some discussion earlier and i shall not go into that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house i should like to make a short personal statement in connection with the demonstration which occurred after the vote on clause last tuesday <e> <s> on that day four young ladies were admitted to the visitors gallery in my name <e> <s> until today i was under the impression that they were not involved in the demonstration <e> <s> however i have been advised that those young ladies were involved <e> <s> on the basis of that advice i tender my apologies to black rod and his staff for any difficulties that they had to contend with as a result of my actions <e> <s> while neither condemning nor condoning the demonstration i believe that it was understandable given the results of the vote on clause <e>", "<cs> i conclude by repeating the words spoken by a year-old girl yesterday as regards clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i come to this debate as a member of the manchester family practitioner committee and therefore with some experience in the operation of the national health service <e> <s> i am also the son of a family doctor <e> <s> however i am by profession an engineer <e> <s> one lesson that engineers learn is that if one has a very efficient engine and one runs it on a very lean mixture one will effectively destroy it <e> <s> there should be widespread agreement that the national health service is one of the most if not the most efficient ways of delivering health care to the community <e>", "<cs> my lords when we discuss anything to do with northern ireland we should recognise that that part of the united kingdom is significantly different from other parts of the united kingdom <e> <s> i stress two particular differences <e> <s> the first is the horrendous nature of the unemployment problem and the poverty that exist in northern ireland <e> <s> the second which is unfortunate but is one which we must appreciate is the nature of the sectarian divide that exists in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the house for arriving rather late last night and missing the early part of the debate <e> <s> i can assure those who spoke before i arrived that i have read all their contributions with great interest <e> <s> i may raise one or two points later <e> <s> i should also like to thank the usual channels for arranging this two-day debate which has allowed everyone who wanted to take part to do so <e> <s> it is significant that the list of speakers is so long <e> <s> it is an indication of how important the nation feels the bill to be <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may enter this debate <e> <s> the last speaker has introduced a very interesting point <e> <s> it is quite all right in her view for a parent governor not to be a parent <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness had allowed me to finish i would have said that the parent governor could effectively be a parent governor of the school even though having had no children at the school for a period of three years <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him why he keeps inserting the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can enter the debate at this point <e> <s> there are a couple of points which have not been considered in this debate <e> <s> we are asked by the government to believe that they will make an order that will give power and discretion to the local authority virtually to the level of the individual household <e> <s> quite honestly after nine years of this governments activities in restricting the powers and abilities of local authorities i cannot believe that anyone would accept that as a sensible explanation <e> <s> that is quite apart from the difficulty mentioned by the noble lord lord morton of shuna concerning the discretion in terms of the detailed level of categories that is liable to be made available <e> <s> the mind boggles at the risk of dare i say corruption coming into play if a local authority could make a decision on the terms of the community charge levy down to the level of the individual household whether or not as has been suggested it could discriminate against red-haired people <e> <s> that seems to be ridiculous <e>", "<cs> while i agree with the arguments put forward by my noble friend on the front bench i was interested to hear the comments made by the noble lord lord jenkin of roding <e> <s> i ask the government to clarify the situation <e> <s> is it true as he suggested that rich people with more than one home have more than one vote as individuals in local authority elections <e> <s> if that is the case it is not the popular understanding of the situation and i would hope that the government might do something to correct that anomaly and ensure that rich people <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just make the point that i did not talk in terms of the second home owner being rich <e> <s> i talked in terms of rich people with two or three homes <e> <s> there is a difference <e>", "<cs> so far as i understood the history of this country the qualification to vote being based on ones income or ones property was abolished many years ago <e> <s> we now live in a country where there is adult universal suffrage based on the individual and not on their rate-paying or tax-paying ability or their wealth characteristics <e> <s> surely that is the criteria on which any democracy should determine the capacity to vote and not on whether an individual pays rates <e> <s> to think that if one pays rates in two different areas gives one the qualification to vote is preposterous in this day and age <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not going to enter this debate until i heard the speech of the noble lord lord swann because on the face of it the amendment does not seem to do a great deal and in practice whether we pass it or not the governments reaction will be cursory i would suggest <e> <s> however it is very interesting to think we are talking about a subject where local initiative control influence and decision-making are being taken away by the government <e> <s> it is curious to think that we are discussing this subject on the day in which comrade gorbachev is actually asking the soviet people to relieve the local institutions in the soviet union of the dead hand of the party and the bureaucracy <e> <s> here we are speaking about an amendment which asks the government not to impose the dead hand of bureaucracy and the party and in this case it is the tory party on academic institutions <e> <s> it is interesting to draw the parallels <e> <s> in this country we are going in one direction in the soviet union they are going in the other direction <e> <s> i wished to make that observation in support of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the interesting things about the debate is that following the inf agreement the changes in the soviet political scene and the <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the problems we are faced with is the concept of conflict between teachers either as a professional body or a body of employees and the community and the parents on the other side <e> <s> it seems to me that one of the best ways of reducing that conflict is to go along with the amendment and place the teachers the parents and the community in general as equal partners in a project to determine the schools philosophy and future because that is what is involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lady turner for introducing the subject and i do so for two reasons <e> <s> i am a member of msf and therefore a colleague and i work in british manufacturing industry <e> <s> i see that what is projected to happen to shorts is bringing the company into risk <e> <s> i hope that in speaking for shorts i can speak also for british manufacturing industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about freedom of speech democracy and terrorism <e> <s> however before doing so i should like to thank the media especially the bbc for their reaction to this government action <e> <s> as noble lords will be aware they are now prefacing reports where they would have interviewed someone now supposedly banned with the remark this broadcast is coming to you under the broadcasting restrictions imposed by the government <e> <s> that effectively puts the scene into context alongside the problems that the bbc has in reporting the situation in south africa <e>", "<cs> i think that there is a wide measure of agreement that the publication and the broadcasting of matters which tend to be racially inflammatory or pornographic is not permitted <e> <s> however in this instance we are talking about the elected representatives of the people of a valid political party that contests elections and in the case of sinn fein has over supporters who are prepared to put their tick on the ballot paper <e> <s> are we going to say that their spokesmen should be denied any say <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may clarify my remarks <e> <s> at no stage did i say that the government did not have the legal right to do what they have done <e> <s> i was trying to point out that by doing it within the legal framework without any prior public consultation and i consider that consultation to be part of the democratic process they have left themselves in a situation where not having had advice from the public and other political parties they have gone ahead with an action which will be counter-productive <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate could quite easily have devolved into farce as the denham dilemma or berties backwoodsmen <e> <s> but i am glad in a way that it has been much more serious than that <e> <s> there is the funny side of course because we are a complete anachronism <e> <s> we in this country call ourselves a democracy and yet we are ruled by a parliament that is so undemocratically constituted as to be a laughing stock to the rest of the world <e> <s> it is only the good manners of the rest of the world which prevents it from laughing at us all the time <e> <s> unfortunately some of our actions are changing that and i suspect we are becoming a bit of a laughing stock <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment i find myself in a somewhat curious position <e> <s> the only reason for supporting the amendment is if the bill goes through to become an act and we end up with identity cards for football supporters <e> <s> one aspect that we must bear in mind is that if the bill is enacted we must set up a scheme which will not destroy the game of football as we know it largely because of economic reasons and falling gates <e>", "<cs> except millwall somebody says <e> <s> on one side of us we had hardened manchester united supporters and on the other we had very strong supporters of millwall who had come up from london to watch the game <e> <s> at the end of the match there was general agreement that it was a good one <e> <s> there was plenty of activity with goals scored and that kind of thing <e> <s> i am sure that the millwall supporters were a little downcast because they had lost but we saw a bloody good game of football <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the noble baroness lady blackstone for opening this debate <e> <s> i must apologise as i shall have to leave before the end of the debate and not least because i shall also miss the debate on dog registration later tonight <e> <s> i am sure that proposal will receive the overwhelming support of your lordships <e> <s> i shall read the balance of the debate that i missed later <e>", "<cs> i rise to question why we need even think about restricting local councillors allowances which is effectively what we are talking about in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the noble lord lord hunter of newington for bringing the debate before us today <e> <s> the interesting point is that the uncertainties that face the national health service are will it be properly funded <e> <s> will it be privatised <e> <s> the only solution to those uncertainties is for the people of this country to elect a labour government <e> <s> that makes for a very short debate so i thought it would be quite useful to develop that a litte <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that the very high level of mortgage interest rates is causing a reduction in private housing investment <e> <s> would it not be sensible for there to be a corresponding increase in public sector housing investment to ensure that the overall level of housing investment is maintained in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i must rise again <e> <s> the minister has not answered the question <e> <s> given the reduction in private housing investment is it not more sensible that there should be an increase in public sector housing investment <e> <s> i did not say that it should be council housing or housing association investment <e> <s> i referred to the broad total of public sector housing investment <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall all have been interested in the ministers response when he said that everyone including the passenger on the clapham omnibus appreciates the benefits of the county council <e> <s> when is it proposed to reintroduce the metropolitan county councils which include the glc and the large metropolitan counties that existed before the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord callaghan for introducing the debate <e> <s> i rise to speak because i am probably one of the few members of the house who was born after the last war <e> <s> most noble lords will have experienced the last war and some will have experienced the great war <e> <s> those experiences will therefore colour their vision of the situation today <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that that means that the government will call an early general election so that the people of this country can make a decision on how their tax rates are to be fixed this year <e>", "<cs> my lords does the reply that we have just received from the government indicate that we shall export our homeless to denmark <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must apologise to the house for coming without any warning into the middle of this debate <e> <s> i was a little late getting to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the intervention <e> <s> it does not surprise me that mortality falls when doctors go on strike <e> <s> i have felt that they are a rather over-blown profession at the best of times but i leave that to one side <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rapidly becoming a jack-in-the-box <e> <s> when i finish this time i shall sit down and take no more interventions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene but the minister has said that the money would be backdated and paid from st april <e> <s> the problem i have is that i believe that a number of ambulance workers have been suspended and they have not been paid <e> <s> are the government effectively saying that all those who have had pay withheld from them during this dispute will be paid fully including the increase that the government are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene but fairness like beauty is in the eye of the beholder and the british public behold the government not to be fair to the ambulance workers <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the difficulties of the debate this afternoon has been the way in which it has taken place <e> <s> all noble lords have spoken in support of the social charter but nobody on the government benches has been prepared to stand up and argue the case <e> <s> it is a rather difficult debate to contribute to because there has not been the normal to and fro <e> <s> the noble lord lord irvine of lairg suggested that the noble lord lord strathclyde is a volunteer <e> <s> given that the noble lord lord strathclyde is fronting for the government i wonder whether he is not a volunteer but a pressed man <e> <s> however we shall not think any the worse of him for that <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government advise on whether the prosecutions liable to be brought by the stock exchange will be of a civil nature or will be criminal prosecutions <e> <s> if they are to be criminal prosecutions does this indicate a departure from previous practice whereby the state or the executive if i may put it that way was responsible for criminal actions and private prosecutions were brought on the civil side <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that in the city of manchester an estimated million is required for capital expenditure to ensure adequate provision of educational establishments <e> <s> is she further aware that the government have allocated about one-tenth of that amount less than million for capital expenditure on our educational establishments <e> <s> given the introduction of local management of schools there is grave concern about the provision for special educational needs <e> <s> will the government look into that matter and where necessary make extra provision for that important subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with much that speakers have said in the debate <e> <s> however there is general agreement and a recognition that problems in manufacturing industry are very significant <e> <s> i should like to touch on three slightly different aspects that have been raised this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that central government lay continual burdens on local government to provide services particularly to the elderly <e> <s> are they also aware that central government have continually over the past years constrained the abilities of local authorities to raise their own revenue <e> <s> are they aware that the introduction of the poll tax has further constrained the ability of local authorities to raise revenue to fulfil their duties <e> <s> are the government looking at changes to the way in which local authorities can raise revenue in order to meet the responsibilities laid on them by central government <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been given the answer that the government will not intervene where large rises in council house rents have been proposed by local authorities because they do not agree with interfering in local government <e> <s> will they make a statement now that they will not cap local authorities in connection with the poll tax if those authorities have levied a community charge to pay for local services <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may pose a slightly different question to the leader of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak partly about the timing partly about parliamentary procedure and partly about the text and implications of the amendment itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak in this debate as a citizen of manchester and as a proud labour councillor for the brooklands ward in the town of wythenshawe in the city of manchester <e> <s> i am angry at the way this government have treated my fellow citizens in manchester <e> <s> not only has manchester been deprived of rate support grant over the past years but we now also have the imposition of the terrible poll tax <e> <s> not content with depriving the city council of about million of business rate that incidentally has not benefited businesses because of the transitional arrangements for the introduction of the national business rate the government are also forcing every citizen of manchester to pay to a government fund which the government then disburse to tory authorities such as wandsworth and westminster to maintain low poll taxes in those areas <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may raise a point which the minister mentioned regarding the possibility of gps being on the health authorities <e> <s> part of the argument is that those who are budget holders should not be on the authority because effectively they will be employing themselves in some respects <e> <s> however we are in a situation where there are no budget holders and there will not be any budget holders until after the introduction of the new authorities <e> <s> we are thus in a position of being asked by the government to say that we will only pick health authority members who are not going to be budget holders <e> <s> we do not know who they will be and therefore almost by definition the <e>", "<cs> i am currently a member of the manchester family practitioner committee <e> <s> i have to tell the committee that over the past six months or so there has been the introduction of general managers to family practitioner committees as opposed to administrators <e> <s> in some cases the original administrators have become the new general managers so there is continuity of service in that respect <e> <s> however on a quite significant number of occasions there has been the replacement of the original administrator by a new person as general manager <e>", "<cs> my lords in concluding the debate i must thank very warmly all those noble lords who have contributed <e> <s> you might think that i would want to take exception to the contributions of various noble lords but i do not think that that is my job <e> <s> it is important that we learn from each other <e> <s> everyone who has contributed to the debate has a point of view which is valid from his or her perspective <e> <s> although i believe that those who have argued that there has been peace in europe for the past years because we have had nuclear weapons are wrong that does not mean to say that it is not a valid point of view <e> <s> it is held by many people <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise as a humble back-bencher with no official relationship to australia to welcome this bill and this second reading debate <e> <s> it is interesting that we had the contribution from the noble and learned lord lord donaldson of lymington <e> <s> it is important that we listen to the information that he has given and take it on board <e> <s> the historical continuity of records is important <e>", "<cs> my lords can i explain my interest in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am a school governor <e> <s> as i understand it it is the responsibility of the governing body of a school to determine the curriculum to be taught in that school <e> <s> if there are teachers who are not prepared to teach the curriculum determined by the governing body will the minister say whose responsibility it is to determine the employment prospects of those teachers thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government agree that two of the more significant indicators in terms of the building industry are first the number of dwellings that are constructed by the building industry and secondly the amount of manufacturing capacity built by the building industry <e> <s> on those two categories can the government advise the house of the difference between the figures that applied in and the figures that applied in <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will welcome the governments statement that planning regulations are adequate to deal with the siting and construction of marinas <e> <s> will the government comment on the procedure of the use of private bills going through parliament to facilitate the construction of marinas <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage one wonders whether one is in committee or a debate <e> <s> i too should like to thank the noble lord lord irvine of lairg for introducing this topic <e> <s> the headline of my contribution has to be put not thy trust in princes <e> <s> that is the thrust of a number of contributions that we should incorporate the european convention or the universal declaration of human rights into our legislation and leave it to the judges to protect us from all ill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble and learned lords contribution <e> <s> however i bring to him the realisation that we are the other chamber in a so-called democratic parliament <e> <s> it is a chamber which has no concept of or part in democracy apart from the way we vote when reaching decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his contribution <e> <s> i am not sure how it pertains to our debate which is to call attention to the state of civil liberties under this administration <e> <s> i am attempting to point out that virtually all the actions of this administration seek to ensure the ability of rich people to secure their liberties at the expense of the vast majority of people in this country in securing their civil liberties as individuals and collectively <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that the current state of affairs is that the prime minister cannot ask the security services to provide her with information about a particular subject of concern to her <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i must apologise as i shall not unfortunately be able to stay until the end of the debate <e> <s> however i shall read all the contributions tomorrow in <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is acceptable for the school to take from the local education authority the sum of money that would normally be spent centrally would it not also be right for a local education authority to have the proportion of money that is spent nationally by the des to spend on its local schools <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that over years ago they were elected on a promise of cutting taxes and that the average <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister advise the house what proportion of ec nationals treated in the national health service come here specifically for that treatment and what proportion receive treatment under the nhs because they are here for other reasons for example if they are on holiday or on business <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that it would be better for the post office to concentrate on delivering first-class mail on the next working day after posting rather than concentrating its attention on the distraction of sunday collections <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government agree that it is right for members on this side of the chamber and occasionally members on the other side to call the attention of the house by way of example to what is happening in the national health service <e> <s> i am sure that the government will agree that every one of us could cite examples of lack of resources available to the national health service from our own localities <e> <s> it does the house no good to denigrate those people who give examples which reflect the total lack of resources and the need for increased resources in our national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords crown immunity appears to be part of the cause of the problem within birmingham prison <e> <s> will the noble earl make clear to the house that the responsibility rests with the government and not with the crown <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i shall possibly be the only person in the debate who so objects to the bill that i shall probably upset a number of your lordships <e> <s> the bill has been described as a sorry little bill by the maiden speaker whom i congratulate on his speech <e> <s> i describe it in stronger language <e> <s> it is a tawdry little bill that does the conservative government no honour and unfortunately places members of the other place in some odium <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not had the pleasure of visiting hong kong and i am not sure that i ever shall <e> <s> i do not believe that that is necessarily relevant <e> <s> if we are expected to make decisions affecting people in foreign countries is every member of the house and of the other place to be flown around the world to get a personal view on the situation <e> <s> i think not <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned that he hoped to make clear his partys position on the bill <e> <s> in his disclosure <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness clarify the proportions involved <e> <s> i believe that the number of people in macao <e>", "<cs> i have two points to make <e> <s> while this provision may not be the best vehicle to tackle the problem we may have to adopt it because it is the only vehicle available to us if the government cannot provide any other avenues of progress <e> <s> further although superficially her majestys government are not responsible for what happens beyond our shores in terms of what is exported from this country we must remember that the world is shrinking every day <e> <s> citizens from this country travel widely overseas <e> <s> it is quite possible that our citizens will be affected by whatever we export to other countries <e> <s> i believe that the government have some responsibility in this area <e> <s> as i have said failing the advent of any other vehicle that the government can suggest we may have to resort to the vehicle we have in front of us <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> there are two points to be made <e> <s> it seems that we have here a very elegant mechanism to provide the secretary of state with a second bite of the cherry namely an opportunity to look at the matters twice <e> <s> when one considers the position of this chamber that is exactly what parliament provides for the government that is to say the opportunity to have two bites of the cherry one in the other place and one here <e> <s> there is a considerable precedent for that <e>", "<cs> i have a few reservations about the suggestion which has just been made by way of this amendment <e> <s> i must admit that i prefer the earlier suggestion for a mechanism of appeal <e> <s> by using the word appeal i wonder whether we are constraining our arguments too much <e> <s> it is most important that we should consider the public interest <e> <s> the secretary of state must hold the public interest in the forefront of his considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the government need to be careful in their pronouncements <e>", "<cs> the amendment concerns a salient feature of the whole concept of industrial relations <e> <s> one of the most significant aspects of industrial relations is the concept of fairness <e> <s> a major reason for the breakdown of industrial relations is perceived unfairness <e>", "<cs> in rising to express my support for this amendment i should like to make two points <e> <s> the first is consequent upon the speech made by the mover of the amendment during which he referred to the activities of a particular individual in the trade union movement and said that that sort of activity was not normal <e> <s> he led us to believe that such activities could be used as an excuse for blacklisting a person <e> <s> in my view that statement needs to be rebutted <e> <s> i should like to elaborate a little on that aspect of the matter <e>", "<cs> the minister said that the government were concerned about the status of the job applicant at the time when the application for the job is made <e> <s> in that respect the status of being a trade union member is only of practical relevance in terms of the advertisement for the job <e> <s> if the advertisement says that the job is only open to people who are not union members or who are union members then the person making the application has effectively a mechanism for saying i have been discriminated against <e>", "<cs> one of the problems we face is the difference in interpretation of union members considering the situations in front of them and judges considering the situations in front of them <e> <s> two completely different groups of people will be looking at problems from two completely different perspectives <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may throw my normal bit of sand into the works <e> <s> when considering this subject we are faced with two problems that came out of the dock labour dispute <e> <s> the first was the frustration of legitimate trade union activity by the introduction of the talks <e> <s> the other problem was the disrepute into which it brought the courts and the judiciary among ordinary working people because they were seen to be being used <e>", "<cs> we are entitled to dream that the law of the land shall equate with the practical reality of peoples experience and their understanding of what is fair and right <e> <s> we are entitled to have that kind of a dream <e> <s> it is a little unfair to say that this is the wrong time and the wrong place to try to bring that dream to reality <e>", "<cs> i cannot allow the government to get away with that <e> <s> the impression which the minister gave was that strikers would act with impunity <e> <s> nothing could be further from the truth <e> <s> when ordinary working men and women go on strike and that is obviously not within the understanding of members of the government they lose their wages <e> <s> that is the whole source of their income <e> <s> they do not have investments on which to fall back <e> <s> they are not names known at lloyds on which they can fall back for wealth <e> <s> they lose their wages <e> <s> that is a very significant penalty <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down perhaps he can clarify something for me in practical terms <e> <s> consider a situation where a group of workers are discussing industrial action and the normal person who conducts negotiations is the shop steward <e> <s> they vote in the affirmative for industrial action and send the shop steward the named person into management to negotiate <e> <s> management succeeds in buying off that shop steward <e> <s> that is almost unheard of in the union movement but it could happen <e> <s> if the shop steward then refuses to call for industrial action what would be the legal situation of the group of workers if they without any call walked off the site and effectively individually took part in a collective dispute <e> <s> what would be the legal implications <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord murray has made an important point <e> <s> one of the risks of this clause proceeding unamended is not that it would do anything to stop unofficial action but that it would set british industrial relations back by or years <e> <s> perhaps i may quickly explain what i mean <e> <s> i learnt what i know of industrial relations from two sources from union and from management colleagues <e> <s> one of the most significant lessons i learnt was from someone who i think is one of the best managers i have ever met <e> <s> he served his apprenticeship in management with fords at dagenham in the s <e> <s> he recounted to me horror stories about how the foreman on the shop floor had the power to hire and fire people <e> <s> he said that all sorts of malpractices took place including nepotism favouritism the giving of backhanders and so on <e> <s> the power of the foreman was wielded by arbitrary dismissal in other words he had the power to sack a worker instantly <e> <s> therefore if he did not like a persons face he could get rid of him <e>", "<cs> some of the expressions used by the noble lord lord marsh are a little unfortunate <e> <s> i believe that he used the word expedient which we probably all associate with the bill <e> <s> i am not sure whether the term pragmatic is right <e> <s> the suggestion was that those concepts were more important than principle and fairness and that we should therefore discount the concepts of principle and fairness <e> <s> although we are asked to consider an objectionable bill which is both unprincipled and unfair we are still honour bound to ensure that it is as fair and principled as we can make it within the context <e> <s> i hope that we shall not be put off making amendments which will ensure that the scheme is as principled and fair as we can make it rather than just taking it as it is and saying that however unprincipled or unfair it is it is okay <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the point made by the noble lord lord marsh <e> <s> i agree with him in the sense that the bill is unprincipled and unfair <e> <s> i disagree with his view and the governments view that it will work <e> <s> i cannot conceive of a situation in which you encourage people to stay in one place by giving them the ability to move to another place to which they want to move anyway <e> <s> that is not logical <e>", "<cs> i enter the debate from the point of view of the layman <e> <s> we have heard distinguished legal argument on the subject and from what has been said i would come down on the side of not having subsection in the bill <e> <s> we are asked to believe that the purpose of the bill is to provide confidence to people in hong kong most of whom i suspect are laymen <e> <s> they are not highly skilled and professional figures in the judicial environment <e> <s> the clause says to me as a layman that however the governor or the secretary of state acts however illegally harshly or irrationally the courts cannot review the position <e> <s> i spoke earlier about the principle of fairness <e> <s> the whole panoply of our judicial system is there to ensure fairness <e> <s> if through this bill we say to the people of hong kong that they will have no access to the courts their reaction will be that the provisions are unfair <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has referred a number of times <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> the reason i rise is that there has been some reference to the bill conferring no rights of citizenship <e> <s> that seems curious to me in the sense that so far as i am aware citizenships or even more heads of households would be given citizenship in this country <e> <s> there are two ways of looking at that <e> <s> either we can assume that the government do not consider that conferring british citizenship is a right <e> <s> i suspect that even the government would not go that far <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words in defence of lord howie of troon and in rebutting what the minister said <e> <s> the minister seemed to give the impression that engineers were a particular interest group <e>", "<cs> i accept that the minister is suggesting that engineers are only one of many interest groups but perhaps i may put it to the government that in terms of the material continuation of hong kong engineers are an essential requirement <e> <s> effectively the point that lord howie was making was that hong kong would literally fall down if it were not for engineers <e> <s> it is not a question of them being a special interest group it is a question of them being an essential requirement for the future material well being of hong kong <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank all noble lords who have spoken in the debate some in support of my proposals and others seeking clarification <e> <s> by my remarks and the amendments tabled in my name i do not intend to cast any aspersions upon the character or the position of the governor of hong kong or members of the civil service <e> <s> that was not my intention <e> <s> however it is to protect their good name and position that i wish to take away the discretion which may bring them into a situation where other people may think that they may be unduly influenced by money or bribery <e> <s> by keeping the legislation as it is we would be putting them in an invidious situation <e> <s> i see no reason why we should do so <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> it was not terribly satisfactory <e> <s> however in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on the basis that we shall not get far with the government and the bill i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the unenviable task of being tail-end charlie in the debate <e> <s> i had hoped that other members of your lordships house would raise the topics about which i wish to speak and that therefore i need not speak for too long <e> <s> unfortunately that has not proved to be the case <e> <s> if i say straightaway that i shall talk about black hats <e>", "<cs> my lords after years of a conservative government is not the noble earl aware that there has been a change in the way that money is available for disbursement <e> <s> is he further aware that until fairly recently the sources of funds for political parties were in the main the trade unions and companies <e> <s> however since the successes if one likes to describe them in that way of the conservative government individual wealth has increased <e> <s> that wealth has become a major potential source of funding for political parties <e> <s> does not the minister agree that that is a reason for the government to review the regulations that pertain to the funding of political parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not planned to speak in the debate but the subject before us is one of great importance <e> <s> i am angry about the plight of domestic workers which has been reported in our newspapers and described by noble lords during the debate <e> <s> i completely endorse what has been said by other speakers <e> <s> i am sure that the government would agree with what has been said <e>"]
