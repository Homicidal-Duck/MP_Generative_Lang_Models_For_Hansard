["<cs> my lords rising with trepidation to address your lordships for the first time i crave your indulgence <e> <s> the bill which is before your lordships is i understand intended to ensure that the parishioners of any parish who so desire should be guaranteed the privilege of worshipping with the book of common prayer <e> <s> when the church of england worship and doctrine measure came before your lordships house in the most reverend primate the then archbishop of canterbury stated that the measure was intended to give the book of common <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first place i wish to congratulate the noble lord lord kearton on his very interesting and highly instructive speech <e> <s> i trust that now that he has begun we shall hear him frequently <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e>", "<cs> my lords having served on company boards in the united kingdom belgium france and germany i have come to the conclusion that there is much to be said for the german system of workers and office staff representation on the supervisory boards of companies <e> <s> i have had some <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby began his speech which was listened to with great interest by mentioning his task as an inspector of taxes when he had to deal with the taxation of the welbeck estates <e> <s> i wish to take the opportunity to mention that not one penny has come to me from the welbeck estates <e> <s> i should like to mention that otherwise i fear that this forthcoming week my postbag will be heavier than usual with requests for donations which i shall with reget be unable to fulfil <e>", "<cs> my lords the definition of container which is in the bill now before your lordships includes plastic bottles <e> <s> the use of these is less advanced here than in many other countries and will certainly increase <e> <s> will the customer who has to pay more for his beverage by making a deposit on a plastic container not curse at having in addition to return useless receptacles which cannot be employed again <e> <s> will he or she show gratitude to the protagonists of this measure at the next election <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to address the house as i have twice lived in poland <e> <s> the first occasion was as secterary to the british legation in warsaw from to the second as ambassador from june until february <e> <s> the noble lord lord gladwyn has asked what practical steps her majestys government are proposing to take to persuade the polish government to honour their obligations under the helsinki declaration and restore to the polish people their human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not possible to give any indication as to the views of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> i am at a loss to understand how any of your lordships who desires to see truth prevail can oppose this amendment <e> <s> if a ballot is taken before industrial action the union leaders will then know for sure that they have the full and genuine support of their members and will not run the risk of having to call the strike off through lack of support <e> <s> moreover they will be in a position to show the management beyond a shadow of doubt that the industrial action is not merely being fermented by loudmouthed militants but is based on a deep feeling of grievance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble viscount lord torrington on his admirable maiden speech to which i listened i must admit with a measure of envy remembering my own effort some months ago <e> <s> i can do little but echo all that my noble friend lord lauderdale has said with humorous emphasis and deep knowledge of the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first place i should mention to your lordships that while i have the honour to be president of the british nuclear forum the views which i shall express to your lordships are not necessarily those of the forum <e> <s> perhaps i should also mention that for the past years i have represented and still represent rio tinto zinc on the board of the german nuclear fuel manufacturing company nukem <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to draw your lordships attention to the advantages which the purchaser of services will derive from the bill <e> <s> a service mark will provide an indication that the holder of the service mark is presumably reliable and anxious to give a high standard of service in order to maintain the prestige attached to his service mark <e> <s> thus if someone wishes to have his car serviced he will give preference to the holder of a service mark rather than to some garage of which he has had no experience and which might prove to be excessive in its charges and unreliable in its work <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to address your lordships as i was chairman of the joint intelligence committee from september to june <e> <s> the formation of this committee was first proposed by sir maurice hankey later lord hankey in but it was not properly constituted until june <e> <s> the jic as it came to be called was composed of the directors of intelligence of the three services and a foreign office representative who became chairman the post to which i was appointed at the outbreak of war <e> <s> the foreign office representative was appointed chairman as he was the most acceptable member of the committee in view of the rivalry between the three services <e> <s> on the outbreak of war the director of the ministry of economic warfare joined the committee and the heads of m and m attended when required <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to draw the attention of the house to the problems now facing the mining industry and i shall be doing so from a slightly different aspect from that outlined in the excellent and most lucid speech of my noble friend lord hood <e>", "<cs> if the proposed amendment were to be accepted and clause were left out of this bill nuclear-powered generating stations would remain subject to the nuclear installations act of in which some clauses and two schedules lay down a complicated procedure for the licensing of privately-owned nuclear-powered stations and do not afford any encouragement for the private construction and operation of such stations <e> <s> it is unlikely that applications will be made in the near future for a licence to construct privately-owned nuclear-powered stations as small nuclear-powered stations of some to megawatts are not yet economically viable <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been advised that it is desirable that i should mention the following for the record <e> <s> in july i was secretary to the british delegation at the lausanne conference <e> <s> we were about to sign the treaty which we had finished it dragged on for several months when ismet pasha and later inn put forward a demand for a clause to be included that if we ever gave up cyprus or left cyprus we would hand it back to turkey <e> <s> we had held it before the first war as a sort of protectorate but the ottoman empire never abandoned sovereignty <e>", "<cs> my lords we might have expected that this restrictive system of quotas for the international carriage of goods by road would have been swept aside during the years that have elapsed since the treaty of rome came into force as one of the basic principles of this treaty was the freedom to provide services <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to address your lordships since for some years i was a director of british relay wireless one of the first cable television companies <e> <s> there is no doubt that our television is far superior to that in any other country and it is imperative that we maintain our superiority <e> <s> thus we cannot afford to delay the development of cable television <e> <s> the same consideration applies to fibre optics <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for what he said and i hope that we shall be able to return to the subject later <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> apart from the question of cost is my noble friend the minister satisfied that the setting up of an inquiry of this nature serves a worthwhile purpose <e> <s> if so what purpose is envisaged <e>", "<cs> my lords on average how many members of the public attend the sizewell inquiry each day <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like in the first place to comment on paragraphs to and paragraph of the report <e> <s> as was implicit in the evidence given by the institute of geological sciences reserves require to be defined by reference to the cost of extraction <e> <s> we must therefore bear in mind that reserves which are likely to prove uneconomic owing to the high cost of extraction are in fact no reserves <e> <s> paragraphs and comment on the environmental impact of the increased use of coal in particular acid rain <e> <s> this has formed and continues to form the subject of numerous reports the majority of which blame the emission of carbon or sulphur dioxide as the principal source of this evil <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord the minister for what he has said and for the action that he intends to take <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that it would be a mistake not to give encouragement to the iba to seek opinions from those in the advertising trade <e> <s> if those who are the principal sources of money for the cable companies are not consulted there will be considerable friction <e> <s> they will feel left out and rancorous <e> <s> our amendment would encourage and not much more than encourage the iba to seek the opinions of the advertising trade and it would be a mistake not to do that <e> <s> i venture strongly to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in the united kingdom and the united states nuclear power has suffered in recent months from a spell of bad publicity <e> <s> in the united kingdom we have had misfortunes at sellafield and in the united states it has been lack of funds for the completion of nuclear plants and the discovery of faults in the construction of some reactors <e> <s> however elsewhere nuclear plants are in general operating satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to draw your lordships attention to the following developments which have taken place during the six months that have elapsed since the committees report was published <e> <s> on st september the european economic communities commission sent a report to the president of the council on the position as regards harmonisation of social legislation relating to road transport <e> <s> this report contains various statistics for the year ended december together with comments relating to difficulties encountered by firms endeavouring to conform to the eec regulations <e> <s> in particular the german federal republic suggested that a booklet should be published outlining briefly the main social provisions concerning road transport <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wigoder proposes that her majestys government should introduce legislation which will repeal section of the official secrets act <e> <s> i presume that the noble lord lord wigoder is not proposing that this act should be repealed before a measure to protect specific classes of information has been passed by parliament <e> <s> i fear that it may prove difficult to reach a consensus on the terms of the proposed measure to protect specified classes of information the wrongful disclosure of which would cause serious national harm <e> <s> for many years the desirability of amending or replacing the official secrets act has been widely recognised but the difficulties of reaching agreement as to the scope and terms of a new act have so far proved insuperable <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this bill which will place the operations of the atomic energy authority on a trading fund basis and thus give it greater freedom of action <e> <s> while the central electricity board may well be a very big customer of the authority i trust that the authority will not be regarded as an appendage of the central electricity board <e> <s> i hope that the authority will not only be free but also encouraged to undertake such research development and other activities as its management may think fit <e>", "<cs> my lords in our report which was laid before your lordships in april this year we made a number of criticisms of esprit and suggestions as to how esprits operations might be improved <e> <s> meanwhile as was mentioned by the noble lord lord kings norton we have just received copies of the biannual report of the esprit review board dated th october which confirms all the views which were expressed in our own report <e> <s> the esprit method of project assessment must clearly be improved and both the report of the review board and that of our own committee stress the necessity that more attention should be paid to the projects plan of work and communication between partners also that small firms should receive a greater measure of support from esprit <e> <s> it is clear from the report of the review board that the management of esprits projects requires strengthening and that it is necessary to recruit professional managers <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give the cost to the project of each additional months delay in the delivery of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords television without frontiers sounds fine but i have a feeling that we should beware of attaching too much importance to that appellation <e> <s> i detected in the green paper adopted by the european commission in a tendency to propose directives and regulations that may owing to lack of experience hinder rather than further the international spread of television <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister kindly say what benefit has been derived from this expenditure other than supporting british leyland <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that at the international atomic energy conference in dr hans blix launched a proposal that negotiations should take place to develop international nuclear standards of safety <e> <s> this proposal was not accepted <e> <s> are her majestys government prepared to press at the next meeting of the international agency for the conclusion of an international agreement on safety standards for all future reactors <e>", "<cs> being i believe the only person still alive who participated in the locarno conference of which may be regarded as the first serious effort to bring together the people of western europe i was secretary to the british delegation i venture to address the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first place i should like to add my voice to the well-merited tributes that have been paid to our chairman and particularly for the tolerance and patience shown towards a tiresome member of his crew <e>", "<cs> my lords prior to the uk was clearly the most advanced of the european countries in the field of nuclear power <e> <s> in that year the pernicious decision was taken to base the uk nuclear power programme on the advanced gas-cooled reactor and not on the pressurised water reactor <e> <s> both types of reactor had the support of strong lobbies but that in favour of the advanced gas-cooled rector was by far the most efficient and won the day <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to draw your lordships attention to an unnecessary delay which hinders progress of our nuclear power <e>"]
