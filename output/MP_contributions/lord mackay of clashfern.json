["<cs> i should begin by thanking the noble and learned lord for the very kind remarks that he has made about what i said <e> <s> i certainly hope that i shall at least have some opportunity of speaking from my present position rather than his <e> <s> i suggest that the address to which the intimation would be sent would be the address which the accused had originally used <e> <s> what is important is that the court should have an address which is the address which founds the basis of citation <e> <s> the court can fix the date from which the new address will take effect and presumably the new address will not take effect until time has been allowed for the intimation to reach the accused person <e> <s> that will enable the accused to give notice in advance if he has the intention of changing his address <e> <s> he should give notice in sufficient time to have the whole business completed before he actually moves <e> <s> that is the purpose that we have in mind <e> <s> we are of course grateful to the noble and learned lord for the amendments which he had proposed and which have helped us to reach this conclusion superseding his <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the subsection which the amendment seeks to delete is to provide a definition which can be used for economy of language an object which the noble and learned lord was seeking to achieve by some of his earlier amendments <e> <s> i think that it is fairly plain that the definition has to apply at a stage before there is any question of conviction that is at the stage at which the proceedings are being developed <e> <s> the idea of including this fuller phrase <e>", "<cs> i think that is correct but the point is that this definition requires to work right through from the stage at which the new <e>", "<cs> so far as the first part of the proposed amendment is concerned i respectfully agree with what the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey said <e> <s> the onus on this matter is on the accused as a result of general provisions section of the act for solemn proceedings and section for summary proceedings <e> <s> so there is nothing between us on that except the question of whether it is necessary to say the same thing again in this provision <e>", "<cs> i think that the general position with regard to special defences gives rise to the answer that the accused would be able to discharge the onus on him on a balance of probabilities and so far as corroboration is concerned by the nature of the matter i should not have thought that the doctrine of corroboration would have very much of a part to play in this particular situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have difficulty in believing that the noble and learned lord has apprehension on entering any field of law <e> <s> so far as the last paragraph of the circular is concerned it expressed an intention eventually to maintain a national register <e> <s> no decision has yet been taken to implement that intention and my present view is that we should await the deliberations of the stewart committee which is considering alternatives to prosecution before taking this matter any further <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble lord lord wade who has made it clear why he wishes to make this amendment <e> <s> as noble lords know there is a very clear distinction in both our legal systems between statute law and common law <e> <s> the noble lord lord wade has made it clear that it is his intention that the convention should take precedence over both <e> <s> the situation with regard to this clause is that the select committee in the course of its report considered a clause which would take the place of clauses and in the present bill <e> <s> in relation to clause as noble lords will remember the committees suggestion was <e>", "<cs> the amendment which the noble lord proposes this time is one which may represent quite a significant change in the policy of the clause <e> <s> if noble lords were to agree to this amendment the wording would revert to what it was in the noble lords original bill <e> <s> on introducing this bill he had apparently changed course <e> <s> this looks as though he is proposing to change course back again <e> <s> the select committee took the view that if such a clause were effective it would in practice provide an important degree of entrenchment <e> <s> the committee saw such entrenchment in terms of a political restraint upon future governments rather than actual statutory protection for a bill of rights which the committee considered to be impossible under our constitution <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord wade said the question of derogation is dealt with in the <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and learned lord lord mcciuskey said in speaking to this amendment its subject-matter is very important <e> <s> speaking for myself and i can also speak for my colleagues in this <e>", "<cs> my lords if the situation is under subsection the tribunal of fact would be the jury under the direction of the judge <e> <s> the offence which the prosecution has to prove is that the accused person has failed to turn up without reasonable excuse <e> <s> the burden of proof is upon the crown except in relation to the matter of excuse <e> <s> in other words the crown has to prove that the accused did not turn up once that is established it is for the accused to explain that he had a reasonable excuse for not doing so <e> <s> but the tribunal of fact is the jury in that sort of situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill as it stands contains ample power for the court to make the necessary arrangements because the court is entitled to sit on any day for the disposal of criminal business <e> <s> therefore any special circumstances can be the subject of special arrangements <e> <s> i would respectfully suggest to your lordships that the matter is better left that way with the sheriff principal in special circumstances having the responsibility of making special arrangements rather than attempting to lay down such rules as are before us <e> <s> the rules that the noble and learned lord has suggested could give rise to many practical difficulties for example the sheriff having a court in aberdeen to deal with people who may be in much remoter parts of his sheriffdom such as benbecula or stornoway <e> <s> i respectfully submit that discretion is the better arrangement here <e>", "<cs> my lords as noble lords appreciate the <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly bring before your lordships what i envisage the act of adjournal will be dealing with and perhaps your lordships will feel that one way of handling the matter would be to circumscribe the power which the court would have in the act of adjournal <e> <s> that would be one way of dealing with the matter if it commended itself to your lordships <e> <s> but in this area i think it is important to retain flexibility and that is the reason why it was thought best to have this matter in an act of adjournal the court holding the balance and being able to adjust that balance in the light of experience <e> <s> as i said at the beginning these are matters in which all of us learn <e> <s> i do not think anybody has a reasonable claim to the fountain of all knowledge on these matters <e> <s> we learn <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i know the court in scotland has never actually prevented a lord advocate from proceeding <e> <s> i think the matter may be the subject of debate in a particular case soon and therefore i do not propose to say anything more about it than that <e> <s> but i would suggest that the situation in which you have a very narrow case which causes concern is a very difficult one and we suggest that one option that should be open to the court it will take account of all the circumstances in deciding whether or not to adopt it is to set aside the conviction allowing the lord advocate to re-indict if so advised <e> <s> of course the court would first of all decide whether it should do that but the lord advocate would also have to consider whether notwithstanding that he was given that right he should exercise it <e> <s> i would envisage it being exercised in only very rare circumstances but we believe it is an advantage to have this power in the court and to leave the court its discretion in deciding whether to use it <e>", "<cs> certainly if it is referred to in the course of the debate it would become public my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i would think not <e> <s> but in any case the wrong would be greater if the citizen had to be arrested and taken to the police station <e> <s> that would be my view of the matter <e> <s> i would suggest that if all that the police wanted to know was whether their suspicion that a man was carrying an offensive weapon was correct and they could search him on the spot and discover one way or the other whether it were true and if it were not true no further proceedings were necessary that is preferable to having to carry him off to the police station to have all that done <e> <s> i would suggest that that is a reasonable justification for these proposals <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that those who answer this description prefer now to be called by this name and we see no reason why we should not give effect to their wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be read a second time <e> <s> i am moving today the second reading of a bill which deals with matters which are of the greatest importance to the interests of the united kingdom as an international trading nation <e> <s> the objective of this bill is to improve the defence of the united kingdom against attempts by other countries to enforce their economic and commercial policies outside their own territories <e>", "<cs> my lords the circumstances are principally in the anti-trust field in which as i have sought to explain the penalty is not only the ordinary penalty of a fine as in ordinary criminal proceedings but the penalty exacted by a private attorneygeneral the individual company which alleges that it has been harmed of three times the damage which it has suffered <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by joining with those of your lordships who have congratulated the noble lord lord renton on his excellent and thought-provoking maiden speech <e> <s> i am particularly glad that he mentioned the recommendation of the committee of which he was such a distinguished chairman on the preparation of legislation some time ago in its recommendation that a scottish law officer should be a member of your lordships house <e> <s> i am particularly grateful at least on this occasion that that recommendation has been given effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged and glad too that my right honourable friend the secretary of state in the exercise of his great abilities saw fit to pay tribute to this house and leaving myself out of course i join in it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged <e> <s> i think that that is a reason for the criminal sanction and as i say one would not have an effective provision with no sanction at all <e> <s> so far as civil sanction is concerned think it is at least doubtful whether an interdict or injunction would be appropriate <e> <s> certainly so far as interdicts are concerned i speak with great diffidence about injunctions they are not available once the act complained of has been done <e> <s> the interdict is to prevent the doing of the act and by the time the obligation had been breached the act in question would have been done <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not want to get involved in too detailed an argument at this moment but i think that what is provided by clauses and is in the nature of a prohibition and clause is intended to enforce that prohibition <e> <s> normally one might not get any intimation in advance that the prohibition was going to be breached until breached it was <e> <s> however this is a matter of detail which perhaps we can take up again in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect i think the situation is that subsection contains a basic requirement for the exercise of the discretion <e> <s> subsection contains a different one and the restrictions are contained in subsections and respectively for the subjects with which they deal <e> <s> however this again is a matter we can return to <e> <s> i am happy to know that the principle of the bill has such support and therefore i invite your lordships to give it a second reading <e>", "<cs> we are sympathetic to the principle that the police should record the time when the caution in terms of subsection is given and the identity of the officer who gives it <e> <s> this will serve to ensure that a particular officer is assigned responsibility for telling the detained person of his rights and that he is told at the proper time <e> <s> however we are doubtful of the value and practicability of recording the other details mentioned in the amendment <e> <s> i shall certainly undertake to bring forward an amendment dealing with the first two matters <e> <s> we remain doubtful with regard to the value of the rest for the reason that these matters are fairly stereotyped in nature and we cannot see any particular virtue in inviting somebody to sign the record in the circumstances that are likely to obtain in this situation <e> <s> i hope that with what i have been able to say the noble and learned lord will be satisfied <e>", "<cs> yes i am happy to do that <e> <s> i wanted to make clear what we have in mind at the moment and not to be too encouraging but certainly we will consider it further <e>", "<cs> although i entirely understand the point of view that my noble friend has put forward in support of this amendment i should like to point out that there are substantial difficulties <e> <s> when a person is released from detention he is of course free to go about his business and if he wishes to go and have a medical examination as soon as possible <e> <s> there is no need for the police to be involved <e> <s> i would respectfully agree with what the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey has said about complaints against the police <e> <s> i have succeeded him in having to look at these complaints and my experience by and large is very much the same as his although so far it is over a much shorter period <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has of course anticipated the reason which led to the insertion of this word <e> <s> the purpose is to prevent the detainee asking that intimation be made to some well-known figure with whom the detainee has no connection whatever <e> <s> the way we thought to achieve this is to require that the power should be reasonably exercised by the detainee <e> <s> of course if one person named by the detainee is rejected as being occasioned by eccentricity mischief or frivolity then it would be possible for him to nominate someone else <e> <s> it appears necessary to us to protect the situation against abuse of this power and that is the reason for the word and we think that this is the best way to achieve it <e>", "<cs> the provision of section of the criminal law act is in these terms <e> <s> i am glad that it was the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey who said that it was a good precedent coming from the law of england but i certainly accept that it is perfectly reasonable that we should follow it <e>", "<cs> i will try to deal with the legal point first <e> <s> sections and of the act deal with the situation following arrest and by that time according to our understanding of the position the police would have to have sufficient evidence to charge the person <e> <s> that is the difference between our law and the law of england that arrest and charge are more or less simultaneous and the proper justification for arrest is that one is in a position to charge so that by that stage the investigation has at least reached the stage of having sufficient evidence available to the police <e>", "<cs> i am saying that it could apply to the solicitor <e> <s> that may be a matter for the judgment of the police and i would not want to suggest that it may ever apply to a solicitor it may or it may not <e> <s> it is a matter for the judgment of the police <e>", "<cs> the situation would be that the power to postpone notification would be circumscribed by this particular restriction and therefore the police would require to justify the delay to anyone who was entitled to question the whole procedure <e>", "<cs> i sought to explain earlier that sections <e>", "<cs> this is a matter which no doubt is susceptible of considerable argument but i would point out that sections and were enacted against the background of the then existing law and the only power of apprehension that exists in the law of scotland apart from that in clause is the power of arrest <e> <s> i shall be glad to look at the matter again but certainly my understanding of the position is that sections and apply from the time of apprehension under the law apart from clause and from then on the rights <e>", "<cs> think i said on second reading that the government would look carefully at any proposals for improving the bill and the kind of proposal that the noble lord lord monson has suggested would certainly be looked at but from what he has told me i cannot at the moment say that i would do more than that <e>", "<cs> certainly we are prepared to look at this again <e> <s> the construction that we had put upon this matter so far was that the constable had to be in a situation of having reasonable grounds for suspecting and no more that is to say he is in a situation of mere suspicion and not of having evidence for example that the person had been convicted of an offence <e> <s> but perhaps more importantly the clause read as a whole we would have thought carries with it the implication that the search would either confirm the suspicion or <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the situation is that the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey will not be able to be with us on the next occasion when the committee considers this matter and the same applies to the noble and learned lord lord wheatley <e> <s> therefore we were anxious that the committee should have the benefit of their views upon this clause before we sought the adjournment <e>", "<cs> your lordships may take it that i shall do my level best to secure agreement on this clause and anything that is possible to achieve that will be done by me <e> <s> i think the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton also has an amendment to this clause <e>", "<cs> it is not the purpose of the amendment to attempt to bind parliament in the future <e> <s> what is attempted to be done is to make clear the scope of this clause and to make <e>", "<cs> i should like to deal with the amendment which is before your lordships at the moment because the two are slightly different although i agree that they relate to the same matter <e> <s> at the present time the prosecution has a right to bring a witness along on hours notice and in this clause we have reproduced for the defence the present rights of the prosecution <e> <s> we thought that was fair <e> <s> i entirely appreciate that hours is a little short and it seems to me to be short in the present rules for the prosecution but it is important that the balance should be preserved <e> <s> at the moment there is not power at all for the defence so that the provisions we have put in for the defence are modelled on those available to the prosecution and in accordance with the thomson committees proposals <e> <s> i therefore propose to accept the amendment moved by the noble lord so far as it substitutes hours for giving the witness a longer time and in due course in order to preserve the balance we will bring forward an amendment to alter the present rules for the prosecution in that respect <e>", "<cs> yes i accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i have just explained this is a reproduction of what is available for the prosecution and if we were to leave out this subsection the situation would be that the person who turned up would not be in the same position relative to the defence as he is in relation to the prosecution and i submit that the correct course is to have these penalties in the bill <e> <s> the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes as i think i have said we are reproducing for the defence exactly the same <e>", "<cs> so far as this clause is concerned as noble lords will see the proposal is that the witness should be cited to appear before the sheriff <e> <s> there is never a situation which involves just the accused and the witness it will be an appearance before the sheriff <e> <s> and once the witness appears before the sheriff then of course the sheriff will be in control of the situation and he will be a person available to testify to what has occurred as well as the accused himself <e> <s> i think that deals with the evidential difficulty referred to by the noble lord lord galpern <e>", "<cs> i have not said that he will be on oath <e>", "<cs> it may be that i have contributed to this situation to some extent and if so i apologise <e> <s> the whole provision applies to the citation of a prosecution witness for precognition <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble and learned lord lord wheatley for what he said about that <e> <s> the whole provision is subject to the words the noble and learned lord lord fraser referred to shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to be summarily subjected forthwith to a fine and so on <e>", "<cs> it is sections and <e>", "<cs> section is the one that particularly gives these provisions <e>", "<cs> yes certainly i am prepared to do that <e> <s> that point perhaps arises on section which refers to <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has said the thomson committee did not propose the abolition of the first diet altogether <e> <s> perhaps i should explain very briefly the place of the first diet in our system <e> <s> the main part of the solemn procedure in scotland involves the second or trial diet and some time before that trial diet there is a mandatory first or pleading diet <e> <s> over the years that pleading diet has become more and more of a formality <e> <s> however there are some questions that can be resolved at that stage and of course if they are resolved it is very convenient from the point of view of making it unnecessary to bring the jury along the witnesses along or to have the attendance of the parties themselves the prosecutor and the accused at the trial diet <e>", "<cs> it is important to appreciate the distinctions which exists between the various parts of what is proposed here <e> <s> for a considerable time in scotland there has been a rule which limits the amount of time for which a person may be held in custody <e> <s> subsection of the new section which we propose deals with the situation where a person is detained in prison awaiting trial <e> <s> in that situation the proviso is that the power to extend shall not be available if the need for the extension arises from some fault on the part of the prosecution <e> <s> the same is true in the clause which deals with summary offences where again the situation is one in which the person is detained as your lordships will see from line on page <e> <s> both of these are in respect of persons detained <e> <s> it is right that a very strict view should be taken of any application for extension arising in a situation where a person is in detention <e>", "<cs> i am happy to say that there is no difference in effect between lord frasers proposal <e>", "<cs> so far as i am concerned interventions by english noble lords are extremely welcome particularly when they are so supportive of the government as was that intervention by the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge <e> <s> the intention of this clause as noble lords have appreciated is to make it essential for a person detained in custody on a summary complaint to be dealt with within days and i do not think anyone has suggested that that is other than a good thing <e> <s> so far as resource implications are concerned we have tried to take account of that <e> <s> of course this clause like the rest of the bill would be brought into effect by an order made by the secretary of state under clause <e>", "<cs> as noble lords know the bail act has not yet come into operation although we expect it soon to do so <e> <s> i think it fair to say that i am doing all possible from the point of view of the lord advocate to see that people are not unnecessarily detained in custody generally across the whole field of criminal proceedings <e> <s> of course this discretion has to be exercised responsibly but we are doing our best to make sure that no person is unnecessarily detained in custody <e> <s> this sanction will help in the framework to achieve that result <e>", "<cs> there is no question of any esoteric point of law here but in our view a very important point of individual or civil liberty is involved <e> <s> if this provision is to be enacted in our view it will be an important safeguard of the liberty of the subject on much the same lines as the provision of much longer memory to which the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton has referred since in solemn cases <e> <s> this will be a somewhat similar provision in relation to summary cases <e> <s> although the facts and other matters to be weighed would be within the competence of the sheriff there is no esoteric point of law as <e>", "<cs> that arises where a person is not in custody and we are perfectly content that the sheriff should decide in that case but a decision whether a person is to be kept in custody on a summary matter for more than days is we consider one which should rest with a judge of the high court <e>", "<cs> i do not have the figures with me at the moment <e> <s> i have had them from time to time and it is abundantly plain as all noble lords who have spoken on this matter have mentioned that there is a problem with witnesses being assembled the trial ready to proceed and a plea of not guilty changed to a plea of guilty at the last minute with consequent inconvenience to people who have no real concern with the case except as witnesses <e> <s> in that situation the government feel it is important that something should be done and this proposal of clause follows the very idea which the noble and learned lord lord wheatley mentioned <e> <s> it is correct to point out that clause is not imposing a mandatory diet it only gives the court power to have such a diet <e> <s> it is in the nature of an experiment really which cannot go ahead without statutory authority <e> <s> one has seen difficulties of this kind before <e> <s> if one wants <e>", "<cs> the situation so far as the clause is concerned is that it will be a power in the court <e> <s> i have no doubt that the court in exercising the power would have regard to all the circumstances of the case as these were laid before it by the prosecutor and the defence <e> <s> i should like to make it absolutely plain that there is no intention of anything in the nature of plea bargaining in connection with this proposal <e> <s> the idea is to find out the state of preparation of the defence <e> <s> it is not to prevent last minute changes of plea where that is unavoidable <e> <s> that can happen as the noble lord lord hale has pointed out <e> <s> some change of circumstance can arise at the last minute which gives rise to a change of plea <e> <s> we feel that there are circumstances in which the last minute change of plea is due to the late stage of preparation <e> <s> it is that point that we desire to deal with here <e> <s> it is really a matter with which the court itself has been concerned from time to time pointing out the inconvenience that is caused both to the court and to others and pointing out the delay to other cases caused by making available diets of trial which are not taken up <e> <s> the whole thing becomes cumulative it is a serious problem <e> <s> i am sure the committee would welcome anything that would contribute to solving it <e>", "<cs> the intention is not to make the accused liable to double jeopardy in the strict sense <e> <s> it is simply making clearer what is in any event clear that the categorisation of the particular offence by statute does not affect the courts power at common law <e> <s> it does not mean that for exactly the same action one would be subject to both of these penalties at the same time <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this clause is as my noble friend lord selkirk has said to deal with the situation where a person who is on trial deliberately misconducts himself in order to make the trial impossible to conduct in a proper manner <e> <s> i am glad to say that so far this has not happened in scotland but the risk of its happening is apparent from what has happened elsewhere <e> <s> it is much better in this situation to be prepared in advance than to give a person who misconducted himself the opportunity of the publicity of trying to get legislation to deal with that case <e>", "<cs> certainly the intention is to make these powers available only when it is absolutely necessary to use them and i am perfectly happy to consider whether anything further can reasonably be added to the clause for that purpose <e> <s> but certainly that is what we have in mind <e>", "<cs> so far as the first point is concerned the situation is that an adjournment would be in the control of the court <e> <s> i have no doubt that the court would consider a reasonable adjournment assuming that special counsel and solicitor had to be appointed to represent the accused in his absence <e> <s> when the accused returned to the court if he did so return it would be up to the accused to decide whether or not he would be better off to retain the counsel and solicitor who represented his interests while he was not there <e>", "<cs> exactly <e> <s> he would have to form a judgment as to whether he would be better advised to keep them they having been present during the hearing while he was not there or whether he would prefer to go ahead himself <e> <s> the point is that he brings all this on himself <e> <s> the object of the clause is to deal with a situation in which a person deliberately misconducts himself in such a way as to render it impossible for the trial to go on so long as he is there <e> <s> i agree that it would be far better if he behaved himself so that the trial could go ahead in the ordinary way <e> <s> i am saying though that if he misbehaves himself this is the best that can be done in the circumstances to protect his interests and i submit to noble lords that this would be a very reasonable protection for him <e>", "<cs> we have done our best to get a workable arrangement <e> <s> we should be happy to consider a constructive proposal for its improvement but until now this is the best that we have been able to propose <e> <s> i agree that it has difficulties but as i have said those difficulties would be brought by the accused person upon himself <e>", "<cs> i think i am right in saying that the clause as presently before the committee is not the same clause as was in the previous bill <e> <s> the proviso with regard to representation is something different <e> <s> but in any case i would take a stand on the existence of the problem as a potential problem and there is no better way of dealing with such a problem than before it arises as justification for having this clause in the bill and i would ask your lordships to agree that it should stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> first clause is intended to apply the provisions to sound and television broadcasts in the same way as they apply in relation to newspapers <e> <s> so although newspaper alone is mentioned to begin with the provisions are extended in that way <e>", "<cs> the principle upon which we have sought to proceed here is the principle enunciated by the noble lord lord wigoder that basically one ought to take what comes out of the bowl or hat out of which the jury is called <e> <s> there is no question of jury vetting in the sense in which that expression has been used here being practised in scotland <e> <s> i made a statement on that matter some time ago <e> <s> the situation in england and wales is different <e> <s> the jury numbers are different and what you require in order to secure a conviction is different <e>", "<cs> we have thought about this a good deal and i intend to stick to this number <e>", "<cs> this entire clause derives from the necessity of provision for looking after the jury if it has to deliberate for a long time and the part of the clause to which the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton has drawn attention is in fact a re-echo of what was previously the law but it is a practical improvement and i am happy to accept it in principle <e> <s> we shall try to give effect to it in an amendment that we shall propose in due course <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for raising this matter and to the noble lord lord renton for supporting him <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this proposal is to enable that to be done <e> <s> the new subsection a which is introduced into section of the act is intended to enable members of the jury to be fed and generally looked after so far as is consistent with performing their function as jury men or jury women <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey was the chairman of a committee that considered this matter in relation to fatal accidents inquiries and suggested that provision should be made on the lines of the present amendment <e> <s> the principle of the amendment is entirely acceptable to me indeed i thoroughly commend it <e> <s> however unfortunately the advice i have is that what is proposed would not come within the title of the bill and much as i should like it to be included from the point of view of the administration of fatal accidents inquiries in scotland we would run into difficulties if it were included <e> <s> perhaps some other opportunity will present itself though at the moment i do not have one particularly in mind <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord ross of marnock for raising the matter and i only regret that we cannot give effect to it <e>", "<cs> it might be convenient if i gave the explanation in relation to both these amendments <e> <s> i think one is in relation to the summary procedure and the other is in relation to the solemn procedure <e> <s> the purpose is to allow the leading of evidence in replication in very narrowly defined circumstances <e> <s> if i may take that part of the clause which is the subject of the first amendment for the purposes of illustration it is provided <e>", "<cs> the position would be that they would have to rebut it in advance in so far as they can reasonably anticipate it even under our provisions <e> <s> in so far as evidence came out of a hat as it were something they could not reasonably anticipate at the moment the crown cannot do anything about that once they have closed their case and these provisions would enable them to do so <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient that i give the explanation now <e> <s> paragraphs <e>", "<cs> the justification has already been well expressed by my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> these are minor matters <e> <s> although we do not in any way withdraw from the important principle of scottish criminal law and also to an extent and notwithstanding the efforts of the noble lord lord ross of marnock civil law that corroboration is required i think that without breaching the principle these are sufficiently minor matters to enable them to be proved by the evidence of one witness <e>", "<cs> i think it is perhaps important in looking at what has been said about this particular proposal to have in mind that the bill of advocation to which this applies is a method of bringing under review not the facts of a case but some matter of law procedure which has arisen <e> <s> if the proposal were accepted the bill of advocation procedure would as the thomson committee recommended be available in both solemn and summary proceedings where the inferior court has dismissed an indictment or complaint as irrelevant or incompetent or dismisses the case on some other preliminary ground for example refusal by the court to continue or adjourn a case or to grant leave to desert for that time and place <e> <s> any matter which arises short of a verdict can found the right of a bill of advocation <e>", "<cs> it is perfectly correct as my noble friend lord renton has said that if one leaves out the words in brackets which are the subject of the amendment it would not make a tremendous difference to the effect of the clause <e> <s> however the object of the words in brackets and they are very similar to words in sections to which the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside referred in moving the amendment is to indicate to the court the probable source of the information that it seeks <e> <s> in scotland nowadays the probation officer is no longer available <e> <s> the social work department has to a large extent taken over the role of the probation officer <e> <s> the purpose of this interpolation in the brackets is to direct attention to that person as the person to whom in the first instance one would think of going for this information <e>", "<cs> there is nothing in this clause which in any way reduces the power of the courts in scotland in so far as they have powers already <e> <s> therefore the answer to the last question must be that if it is competent at present it continues to be competent as regards anything that this clause provides <e> <s> the reason why probation orders and orders for absolute discharge have been excluded is that it is thought by us that to impose a compensation order in these circumstances is not appropriate <e> <s> from the point of view of the offender the imposition of a compensation order is very analogous to a punishment <e> <s> the machinery set up for enforcing it is the machinery which affects fines <e> <s> it is really for that reason that these two orders the absolute discharge and the probation order which are really alternative to punishment in the strict sense are excluded <e>", "<cs> at present the criminal injuries compensation scheme is not a statutory scheme so no question of legal right arises under it <e> <s> perhaps the noble lords question could be answered by reference to clause of the bill which deals with a situation where a compensation order exists and an award is contemplated in a civil action <e> <s> the effect is that payments made under the compensation order are taken into account as in effect payments to account of the civil damages <e>", "<cs> any payments made under the compensation order would be taken into account <e> <s> under the present scheme it does not follow that if the person is entitled to compensation for a criminal injury he would have to wait <e> <s> payments would be taken into account in that respect <e> <s> i think that that is a satisfactory arrangement <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that the authority responsible for handing out public money under the criminal injuries compensation scheme would take the proper steps to protect its interests in a situation such as that <e> <s> however i do not think the fact that there was the possibility of payment from another quarter would lead to any delay in payment <e> <s> i am sure that it would be possible to make the legal arrangements in such a way that the public fund would not suffer from any duplication of payment to the person injured <e>", "<cs> i have some opportunity to address sheriffs from time to time <e> <s> and i would certainly undertake to do what i could to draw to their attention the point that has been made <e> <s> i think we can make it reasonably plain that this is our understanding of the provisions <e>", "<cs> at the risk of boring your lordships may i say that in making a compensation order under clause the court is hound to have regard to the means of the person <e> <s> if the person is not in a position to make compensation because of his lack of means then it would not be appropriate to make a compensation order either <e> <s> the thing fits together in my submission <e> <s> i do not wish to continue the argument further <e> <s> i have done my best to explain our position <e>", "<cs> i am happy to accept the amendment and i hope that with it the noble lord is now able to understand the clause <e>", "<cs> as i said i am happy to accept the amendment and i think that makes it considerably clearer <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that we seem to have managed to make it clear to the noble lord lord hughes and with the amendment i think it is clear <e> <s> the effect is exactly as lord hughes said and perhaps it comes better from him than from me that that is what it means <e>", "<cs> so far as the noble and learned lord lord wheatley is concerned i appreciate the practical matters that he has raised <e> <s> we have been concerned to try to provide a timetable and a timetable in relation to appeals is part of the fairly fundamental thinking that underlies the recommendations of the thomson committee on this aspect of the matter <e> <s> we had hoped that sufficient flexibility was preserved by the opportunity in the high court to extend the time and no doubt that could be done as an incidental matter <e> <s> if we were to accede to this amendment it would really mean a fairly important change in the timetable as set out putting the judge in a somewhat different position in not having a defined time to work to <e> <s> i agree that as soon as reasonably practical is a fairly strong persuader to get on with but it does not give one a fixed time <e> <s> these are the reasons that persuaded us that we should have this timetable in the schedule <e>", "<cs> so far as i am concerned i am perfectly prepared to say that we will look at the matter again <e> <s> it has been fairly fully considered but i hope that the noble and learned lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is intended to give an extra power to the court in order satisfactorily to dispose of difficult cases <e> <s> the basic difficulty from which any appellate court suffers is that it has not and cannot have heard all the evidence at the original trial nor observed the demeanour of the witnesses <e> <s> there may well be cases in which it is extremely difficult to set aside a verdict even if one is in considerable doubt about it if one is not in a position at least to authorise a fresh prosecution <e> <s> i have no doubt that the circumstances to which the noble lord lord mishcon has referred the publicity that attaches to this sort of thing and so on would be carefully taken into account by the high court in deciding to exercise this power <e> <s> they would also be taken into account by the prosecution if they decided to implement the possibility which the high court left to them <e>", "<cs> the intention of the government in this connection is to give effect to the considerations set out in the thomson committees third report which amounts in substance to this that no convicted person with substantial grounds for an appeal against conviction should be deterred from lodging such an appeal by the prospect that in the event of failure he may face a stiffer sentence than that imposed at his trial <e> <s> that is the basic principle that we are seeking to go on and the belief is that that intention is carried out in the drafting as it is but in view of the doubt which the noble and learned lord has cast on that and in the light of what he has said we shall be glad to look at it again <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has indeed explained this matter to me <e> <s> the point is made a little more difficult by the fact that the printing is not quite right <e> <s> we felt there may be matters such as for example questions arising out of judicial examination which could be dealt with at the preliminary diet and it was thought wise to try to point the way in that direction <e> <s> certainly the words that the noble lord seeks to delete are not essential and i would be glad to consider this matter further <e>", "<cs> there may be some misunderstanding in regard to this <e> <s> it is not intended to give the court power in this clause to exclude an accused who wishes to be present <e> <s> the idea is to give the court power if the accused does not wish to be present to proceed without him <e> <s> so in a sense his consent is manifested in the sort of circumstances to which we take it these words apply by the fact that he has not agreed <e> <s> that is what is in mind <e> <s> i shall be glad to see if we can make that clearer <e>", "<cs> the procedures which are familiar to the noble lord are not quite so familiar in scotland <e> <s> the idea in this case is that the court of first instance should have a <e>", "<cs> yes certainly <e>", "<cs> have the greatest sympathy with this proposal and i hope that i may be in a position to accept it but i am not absolutely in that position at this moment <e> <s> so if the noble and learned lord will withdraw the amendment i think i can safely say that we may well be in a better position next time <e>", "<cs> the intention in this connection was to substitute for that procedure which is very little used the extension to circuits of the procedure which is used in edinburgh so that the circuit situation and the edinburgh situation would be the same <e> <s> if that is so it would appear to obviate the necessity for this procedure by certification which as the noble and learned lord said has been used hardly at all over quite a long period <e> <s> that is why we propose this abolition <e>", "<cs> certainly we would not lightly disregard any request from the judges and in view of what has been said i think it right that i should undertake to consider this matter further <e>", "<cs> as noble lords have pointed out there are two questions here <e> <s> the first is what are the interests designated to be protected <e> <s> it is of course true that normally the interests of a particular trader will represent the interests of the united kingdom as a whole <e> <s> it is not absolutely essential that that should be so <e> <s> there might be matters of judgment to be taken into account in that <e> <s> what this clause seeks to protect where there is any distinction are the trading interests of the united kingdom rather than those of any particular individual <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier i accept the view that very often the trading interests of a particular firm a particular company will be the trading interests of the united kingdom <e> <s> but the question whether the trading interests of the united kingdom are subject to a threat of damage is a larger question <e> <s> one has to look broadly at the trading interests of the united kingdom as a whole in considering whether individual damage would threaten to damage those trading interests <e> <s> i submit to your lordships that where we are seeking to take action particularly against measures taken by a friendly nation it is very important that we should have good grounds for doing so and only where the interests of the united kingdom as a whole are affected would measures of this sort be properly justified <e> <s> therefore the bill as it stands based on the trading interests of the united kingdom as the matter that must be the subject of a threat of damage is correct <e> <s> to substitute for that the individual trading interests of particular companies would not improve the bill but would damage it <e> <s> i would therefore invite the noble lord to reconsider the amendment <e>", "<cs> the first question is whether the matter which the secretary of state would require to have in mind in deciding to exercise his discretion under the earlier part of the clause is a matter upon which he could usefully refer to the court in any sense of that expression <e> <s> it seems to us that the question is a matter of judgment on fact but not in the nature of a contest <e> <s> it is difficult to picture a situation in which there would be a contest <e> <s> if the difficulty concerns the secretary of state making up his mind because of the complexities of the situation then obviously he would be the only person to contest the matter with the person seeking the order and he would have to take up a position upon whether or not he was going to contest it <e> <s> so going to the court would not obviate that stage of the proceedings <e>", "<cs> i am greatly obliged to both noble lords who have spoken on the question whether clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> and i am grateful for the matters that they have raised <e> <s> in particular we shall consider whether a requirement to submit a contract or other document for registration is covered <e> <s> i venture to think that it probably is covered but we shall be glad to consider the matter <e>", "<cs> i think that the difficulty has been highlighted by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> if one omits commercial and omits any definition at all one would have an extremely wide power which would relate to documents of a purely private or personal nature and go rather beyond the protection which the bill is designed to give <e>", "<cs> i suppose that one good turn does deserve another <e> <s> in a sense the two amendments are closely connected <e> <s> i am going to rely on commercial information and say that as the clause is drafted commercial information will include the oral or written evidence relating to any document or other information <e> <s> with regard to the point made by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones the context of clause <e>", "<cs> this comes back very much to the question we have already discussed <e> <s> if one is giving power in relation to a particular class of document then it seems right that that class of document should be described by reference to its character rather than <e>", "<cs> the situation on this point is that subsection <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could first mention the point that my noble friend lord renton made as to what the noble lord lord mishcon said on second reading since we have the benefit of lord mishcons company now <e> <s> my understanding of the point which he made which i followed at the time i think was that in order for a person in the united states to protect himself in this connection it was necessary for him to be able to plead the amendment and i suspect that he had in mind the amendment which prevents a person from being obliged to incriminate himself <e> <s> the noble lords point of view as expressed at that time was that unless there was a criminal sanction in relation to the prohibition in our statute that self-incrimination doctrine would not apply <e>", "<cs> it appears to be the case that the noble and learned lord lord denning has expressed the view that punitive or exemplary damages might be enforceable in this country but whether or not it is wise to prevent that it is plain that that question could well go much wider than the trading interests of the united kingdom because damages of that sort might well be ordered in cases which have little or nothing to do with the trading interests of the united kingdom <e> <s> accordingly this would appear to be a wider question than falls within the scope of the bill <e> <s> if one is to seek to prevent the enforcement of judgments of that character under the provisions which apply here this is a matter for consideration in relation to a more general provision affecting the enforcement of judgments <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down i should like to make it clear that i did not intend to say and i hope that i did not say that the first part of his amendment paragraph <e>", "<cs> i am not absolutely clear that i have grasped the lacuna which the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has identified to your lordships <e> <s> so far as i understand the position it would hardly be sufficient to define proceedings by reference to what is alleged or claimed in them because i think most of us who have had experience of litigation in any place have had experience of false allegations or allegations being made which were not substantiated <e> <s> it seems a rather unwise test to apply to consider only what is alleged or claimed <e> <s> so if the intention is to enlarge the scope of judgments which are unenforceable under this clause beyond the field of true multiple damages into fields where that is alleged about the basis of the claim but it never turns out whether or not that claim is true then with respect i think that would be unwise <e>", "<cs> certainly i shall endeavour to consider the matter and perhaps i can enlist the help of the noble lord in that consideration between now and the next stage <e>", "<cs> it appears to me that the suggestion which the noble lord has made would be an improvement <e> <s> if he will be kind enough to withdraw his amendment we shall consider bringing forward an improved definition at the next stage <e> <s> i am very much obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> if you take account of amendment no <e> <s> as well i do not think i accept that <e>", "<cs> so far as the amendment is concerned i would invite your lordships to agree it <e> <s> i certainly undertake to consider the matters which have been raised and i am sorry that not even the mellifluous welsh accent of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones makes this entirely happy <e> <s> we will see whether we can improve it <e>", "<cs> i would prefer to have this amendment agreed to subject to the undertaking which i have given and in that case we would try to improve the clause as a whole if that is convenient to the committee <e>", "<cs> yes indeed i shall be happy to do that <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier this raises the question of the assignee a rather difficult question which we are hoping to solve in due course <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord to be so good as to withdraw this amendment on the undertaking that we shall endeavour to cover this matter and possibly some related matters in an amendment to be brought forward at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the opportunity of leisure to consider these matters but my immediate answer is that i would think that the clause as amended is satisfactory to deal with the matters to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> for example i should have thought that a broad description such as all documents relating to x or y or board minutes would not satisfy the terms of the amendment where it refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords i undertook during the committee stage to consider this matter <e> <s> i have tried to do so and the department has done so in a sense independently <e> <s> the situation is that the kind of document that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has mentioned as an example would i think fall within the definition <e> <s> although it is not a document which may be currently used in the business it is presumably kept by the business because of a possible connection with the business either in the past or in the future for instance we know that solicitors are notable for keeping matters that were connected with their past business <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for raising this matter again and also for the benefit of a discussion with him about the problem <e> <s> the difficulty here is to identify in a way which is suitable for the purposes of such an enactment as we seek to produce the situation with which he is dealing <e> <s> as i think i mentioned in committee the difficulty of putting rights on allegations or claims which are not established is quite a real one <e> <s> however if this problem can be identified more closely as time develops it may be that the discretion which the secretary of state has under sub-section <e>", "<cs> my lords clause <e>", "<cs> my <e>", "<cs> my lords like my right honourable friend the attorney-general i have every <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already endeavoured to explain the governments position with regard to the principle of this as the noble lord lord hacking has said <e> <s> this gives me an opportunity which i should like to take to make some reference to the trade marks position <e> <s> i did not mean to pass that over as something of no importance i meant to deal with it as part of the general principle on which we stood <e> <s> we certainly appreciate the importance of these matters and certainly it looks an area to which legislation could possibly at some stage properly extend <e> <s> but at present as i have said we have tried to take our stand on the principle of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i shall be very happy to look to see whether we can improve the situation still further <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the last point her majestys government are always axious to be helpful to companies from the united kingdom trading abroad <e> <s> the foreign office services are always available in that regard also <e> <s> we will certainly consider the suggestion that the noble lord has been good enough to make <e> <s> so far as precedent is concerned as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones will appreciate the clause is very much modelled upon reciprocal judgment clauses and there is a somewhat similar provision in the nuclear installations act <e> <s> although it is perhaps novel in concept it is not a complete departure from a principle which is reasonably familiar <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd for raising this matter <e> <s> it is an important question <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for encouraging me in what i am going to say <e> <s> the concern that this clause should be as effective as possible is understood and appreciated <e> <s> the view we have taken is that that object is more effectively attained without a specific definition of the word measures <e> <s> indeed the lengthy list that the noble lord puts forward lends some strength to that feeling <e> <s> the word measures was used in the act and so far as we know has not given rise to any problems <e> <s> it is intentionally wide but we think it does not need to go quite so far possibly as the noble lords definitions because generally speaking a judgment or something of that sort would be given under something which could be properly described as a measure <e> <s> certainly it is something that would lie behind the judgment that we would have in mind <e> <s> while appreciating this suggestion on the whole we are inclined to the view of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and would like to adopt the situation existing in the bill as it stands <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for what he said about this matter and i am glad that we may be able to concentrate on the essentials <e>", "<cs> my lords the present position is that judicial examination is in private <e> <s> the intention is that this further judicial examination should he in private rather than in open court <e> <s> i should like to have an opportunity to consider whether the best way to make that plain if it is not plain already is by giving effect to my noble friends amendment because this might tend to cast doubt on other provisions where it is intended that the sheriff should operate in chambers <e> <s> if we express it in one place it might raise difficulties about another <e> <s> but so far as the principle of the matter is concerned we entirely accept what my noble friend has said and go along with it <e>", "<cs> my lords the general structure of judicial examination is fairly closely confined by the amendments which we shall be considering later but i would respectfully suggest to your lordships that judicial examination to be a proper one would have to allow questions which invited the accused or gave the accused an opportunity to deny matters alleged in the charge <e> <s> indeed that seems to be the first thing that he might want to do <e> <s> or in some circumstances to justify the actions alleged because he accepts that it happened but he has some justification for it such as for example that he struck a blow in self-defence <e> <s> or he may want to offer comment such as for example that he knows what happened and he knows who did it <e> <s> he is able to incriminate somebody else as we usually say <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that this is an improvement on the bill as it stands at the moment and that it is necessary to limit paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly we are obliged for all assistance in this rather difficult matter <e> <s> so far as lord foots concern with consent goes i would point out that i am proposing a little later to move that the questions should not be designed to challenge the truth of anything said by the accused so that that will considerably limit the sort of difficulty i think he has in mind <e> <s> naturally the process of trying to improve this bill will continue both here and in another place and if we can come up with something better than we have got by all means we shall do so <e> <s> i hope your lordships will feel able to approve this amendment now <e>", "<cs> my lords may i try to answer these questions in the order in which they came <e> <s> first i think it would be necessary if the prosecutor was going to have available a comment in respect of any particular question that that question would have to have been put <e> <s> therefore it would not be sufficient for the prosecutor to stop if the accused shows a general i was almost going to say declination to answer any more questions <e> <s> this is part of the reason why we have given the solicitor a right to suggest that a question he put again because the accused might refuse to answer some of the earlier questions and then adopt a slightly different frame of mind and answer later ones then decide having answered the later ones that he would have been wiser to answer the earlier ones <e> <s> this gives this opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords there certainly is a word declinature <e> <s> perhaps i may get an opportunity to consider further whether declina <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to do that now <e> <s> the situation is that we agree in principle that provisions should be made for the sheriff to allow an accused person to get a solicitor of his choice <e> <s> i explained that to the noble lords noble friend when i spoke to him earlier <e> <s> we are not able however to agree that that could be done independently for reasons which will be apparent <e> <s> we hope to bring forward the necessary amendment to incorporate what i have already said probably in another place because there are amendments required to the legal aid legislation as well as the criminal justice legislation <e> <s> on that footing perhaps the noble lord will be able not to press the matter further at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation here is similar to that which i dealt with earlier <e> <s> the intention is that it should be in chambers <e> <s> we think that is implicit <e> <s> to make it explicit in this case might cause difficulty but we would be glad to look at that matter and make sure that it is in proper form from that point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords the prosecutor has this power in relation to the situation we are considering and it is true as the noble lord lord ross of marnock points out that precognitions are usually taken by the procurator fiscal informally <e> <s> that is really the basis on which i said that this is a power of the last resort <e> <s> it is used by the prosecutor only where there is some vital witness whose position must be clarified in a way which is necessary to be able to establish what was his evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords the word prevaricate appears in section of the criminal procedure scotland act <e> <s> i am not sure whether i know who was the secretary of state for scotland when that act was passed <e> <s> but that is where the word is used in relation to evidence and the noble and learned lord lord wheatley gave an explanation in committee of what he understood it to mean <e> <s> i think that telling lies on oath amounts to the crime of perjury if the matter in question is substantial and is relevant to the case <e> <s> prevarication is intended to be something less than that and of the kind that the noble and learned lord lord wheatley mentioned <e> <s> so i think that the word has at least some honourable antecedent <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may first of all explain the situation so far as the bail act is concerned the situation is that the offences which are there provided for are also possibly offences at common law and what i was saying was that the position is the same as that which we have here <e> <s> also of course the position in relation to this particular clause is in line with matters which are provided for in the bail act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not founding on that clause in the answer i am giving <e> <s> but in any case the situation is that the words to which the noble earl objects are words which are intended to indicate that the powers of the court to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a good deal of sympathy with the views expressed by my noble friend lord selkirk but although i accept a good deal of what he has said about the differences between summary and solemn procedure i consider it may be the best safeguard against such a thing happening in a summary court that there should be such power as this in the court <e> <s> i think this is a matter which will be the subject of a good deal of consideration and certainly we shall continue to consider the matter in the light of what my noble friend has said <e> <s> but perhaps at this juncture he may be willing to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very interested in the explanation given by the noble lord lord ross of marnock for moving this amendment <e> <s> so far as the solicitor-general for scotland is concerned i feel that he will be able to look after himself in connection with whatever is said about him <e> <s> the clause in its present form is not the same clause as that to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> although the differences may not be very great there is a very substantial safeguard in this clause which was not originally in the bill <e> <s> if it was intended to suggest that i was not in favour of this clause i <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that as at present advised but i am always learning i prefer what we have got <e> <s> however i should certainly be glad to look at these suggestions at more leisure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock suggested that there should be sackcloth and ashes for the solicitor-general <e> <s> this is a place where sackcloth and ashes are appropriate for me <e> <s> before i reply in some detail to the noble earl i should like to say that i am very sorry about a mistake that i made in answering the noble earl when he raised this question in committee <e> <s> the reason was that i did not give proper effect in my answer to subsections and of clause which extend the provisions of clause in the first case to england and wales and in the case of clause to northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission i will answer the question that there are somewhat similar provisions in england and wales affecting courts in those countries <e> <s> they are not exactly the same <e> <s> these are modifications of provisions which have existed for some time <e> <s> the two sections which i mentioned have had this ambit and we are only altering them somewhat to increase the protection but the general principle has been operating for some time <e> <s> certainly i am happy to consider whether the matter can be made clearer although i think the extent provisions under clause make the matter clear as at present advised <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation unfortunately is that acts of parliament are amended from time to time and the interpretation act in its most recent form the act of provides in section that where an act refers to an enactment the reference unless a contrary intention appears is a reference to that act as amended and includes a reference thereto as extended <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for bringing this matter forward <e> <s> of course i accept that there is an error here and we are happy to correct it <e> <s> so far as the structure of the clause is concerned the situation is that consequential amendments to the deletion of the first diet are dealt with in the schedule and we have tried to deal with substantive amendments in the main body of the bill <e> <s> i shall certainly consider whether there is any way in which we can simplify this matter <e> <s> my experience so far has been that attempts to simplify sometimes lead to further complexity but i am certainly very glad to consider the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> we have now concluded our scrutiny of this short but important measure <e> <s> i should like to recall the words that i spoke at the end of the report stage last week when i expressed the governments appreciation of the spirit and the constructive manner in which this bill has been discussed in both houses of parliament <e> <s> i believe that we have in your lordships house improved the drafting of the bill in a number of important respects <e> <s> in relation to the most novel and controversial clause which is clause discussions in this house have brought to light a number of significant points <e> <s> we have been able to take account of several of these and i believe that the clause is better drafted and more effective as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> as my noble friend lord lyell explained was to make explicit the point that the persons to whom the clause applied would not be expected to do that which was not reasonable and the provisions in amendment are designed for that purpose <e> <s> the only thing between my noble friend lord teviot and myself is whether the word all should be in the clause <e> <s> my own feeling on that matter is that there is not much difference between the two <e> <s> if a person has to show that he did that which could reasonably be expected of him i think he would have to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the house may be assured that not only what has been said this afternoon but all that is said as matters proceed will be taken into account by us <e> <s> it was because we took into account what was said heretofore that we proposed this amendment in an attempt to meet the difficulties that have been expressed in relation to the word permit <e> <s> it was to make that more explicit so that people could understand that we were asking no <e>", "<cs> my lords i immediately accept that this is an important and serious matter and it is one to which we have given a great deal of thought <e> <s> it is a power in the court that we are seeking here and of course that means that they would take account of all the circumstances in deciding whether to exercise it <e> <s> as i said earlier the courts power is simply to allow the lord advocate to re-indict <e> <s> it would be for the lord advocate to consider in any particular circumstances whether it was fair to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords this may well be a matter of opinion but i think the intention is that the qualification appliesit is a cumulative qualification <e> <s> it is for noble lords to judge whether they are in fact as minor as all that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is consequential to the creation of the new procedure whereby three judges can sit on circuit <e> <s> it was thought to be fairly minor to delete the old form and put this new one in its place but we have been persuaded that there are advantages in having both <e> <s> so we are making a minor amendment to the minor and consequential amendment schedule <e>", "<cs> as i said at the outset my lords in welcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> since governments of both parties have attempted to introduce such a provision as this one but i believe that the formula we have now adopted achieves the right balance between the need to recognise in company law the contribution that employees make and the necessity to avoid saddling directors with confusing or conflicting duties as regards the interests of employees and shareholders <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention of this amendment has been clearly explained by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i must confess that i doubt whether leaving out subsection would of itself produce clarification <e> <s> i rather suspect that it would go in the opposite direction <e> <s> indeed the amendment which is in the name of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and others seems to go in the opposite direction from that presently proposed by the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave i would seek to answer that question by saying that the duty in subsection is placed into the general functions of the directors <e> <s> therefore if the noble lord can envisage any case in which it will be necessary or desirable to enforce these duties owed by the directors that is the sort of case to which subsection will apply <e> <s> in some cases and some circumstances it is possible for that to be done not by the company itself but byperhaps a minorityof members of it on the principles that i have sought to explain <e> <s> as i have said it is not always easy to apply these principles to particular cases and i do not think that it would be very wise for me to try to do that <e> <s> however i think the principles are reasonably plain and i do not believe that to leave out subsection would make the task <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be right for me to say that i appreciate very much the manner in which the noble lord lord wedderburn has explained his point of view and particularly for the observation that he made in relation to the article in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has certainly put before us an interesting amendment which needs careful consideration <e> <s> the noble lord played a most important part in creating the climate of opinion which led to that part of the patents act which provides for an employed inventor to receive a fair share of the benefit for an invention of his which is patented and that is from the passage to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> what is being proposed in this amendment to commons amendment no <e> <s> is that directors should furnish the assistance necessary to the activities of those engaged at various levels in the company in the making developing and working of invention and innovation <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely appreciate the point which the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton is making and i think that i should be right in saying that most of the cases to which he has referred in respect of which difficulty has arisen in distinguishing between contracts of service and contracts for services have not arisen in relation to section of the companies act <e> <s> if what we could do by accepting his amendment tonight would be to rid the law of that difficulty in all circumstances then i think that it would be well worthy of very serious consideration <e> <s> however that is not to say that the point is not worthy of serious consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i distinguish between time and eternity but it is in the course of time that i had in mind but i hope not such time that it might trespass on eternity as i hope this debate will not <e> <s> i think that there are reasonable prospects of a fairly early reconsideration of company law <e> <s> i think that enough has been said to show that section is quite a difficult area in that it requires proper consideration <e> <s> i would respectfully submit that due time not in this bill would be the correct time in which to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be difficult to say that some of the language in some parts of this bill could not if one had much more time to think about it be somewhat improved <e> <s> however i do not accept all that the noble lord has said in criticism of this clause and in particular i take serious issue with the idea that the word specific should be replaced by matters specifically relating toorof concern to a particular company <e> <s> the idea here is that the information must be about specific matters not for example what one learns by general acquaintance with the company such as having been associated with it for a while getting an idea of its general standards of management and that sort of thing <e> <s> it is specific matters relating to the company such as <e> <s> for example that it has landed a particular contract or something of that sort <e>", "<cs> my lords this clause was moved into the bill in another place and provides some indication of the manner in which a company secretary should be appointed <e> <s> there are some amendments to this amendment and perhaps i can reserve what i have to say until we hear what is said on those amendments <e> <s> i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords it appears clear that the intention of this clause is to give some guidance on persons who will be qualified to hold the office of company secretary <e> <s> i think i may have misheard the noble lord <e> <s> he said that <e>", "<cs> my lords at least it makes for consistency <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble lord for pointing out the and to which he was referring <e> <s> i think that <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the noble lords feelings in this matter <e> <s> i have no doubt that the association of which he has spoken is well qualified to be included in the list <e> <s> on the other hand the clause is designed to give guidance to company directors on the obligations that they have to select a suitable person or persons to be the secretary or secretaries of the company <e> <s> the purpose of the list is simply to give an indication of the nature of the bodies that might be regarded as suitable <e> <s> these indications are i agree not by any means exhaustive and the subsection to which the noble lord lord mishcon particularly referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of recommitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> it is true as the noble lord lord mccarthy has pointed out that section of the act did include in acass terms of reference the duty in particular of encouraging the extension of collective bargaining and the development and where necessary reform of collective bargaining machinery <e> <s> it is perhaps all the more striking against that background that when we come to section the power to issue codes that the power was in almost exactly the same terms as we are proposing here <e> <s> indeed he has illustrated very clearly that acas in issuing codes under that power have dealt with aspects of collective bargaining <e> <s> so the power in our clause will by no means prevent the secretary of state from referring to collective bargaining <e>", "<cs> i do not think i have yet seen the code promulgated under the section being repealed by clause a but others may have the advantage of me in that <e> <s> so far as this clause is concerned the intention is to give power to the secretary of state to issue a code of practice <e> <s> industrial relations are developing things and it seems right that he should have power to issue codes as may be required from time to time in parallel with acas <e> <s> i would therefore submit to yout lordships that this is a very desirable clause and that the amendment which has been proposed to it should not be approved <e>", "<cs> the clause of the bill to which these amendments relate gives the secretary of state power to produce such codes after appropriate consultation and with the approval of both houses of parliament as he deems necessary for the purpose stated in the bill itself <e> <s> the function of the secretary of state under this clause is not to write a new textbook on the criminal law or to resolve all outstanding matters related to the kind of offences to which the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton referred but to issue such codes as he thinks desirable for the purpose of promoting good industrial relations and obviously he must take account of the civil law and the criminal law in so doing <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble and learned lord should be in the dark <e> <s> i had rather assumed that he had in fact read the provision which it is sought to amend <e> <s> the provision which we are seeking to include is that <e>", "<cs> first i think that the <e>", "<cs> it is very plain from subsection of this clause that <e>", "<cs> if i may interrupt i agree that it is one illustration <e> <s> there are others <e>", "<cs> the matter is one of convenience <e> <s> the idea is that these codes should deal with subjects under the general power which is contained both in the acas power and in the present clause giving power to the secretary of state <e> <s> it might well be that the secretary of states code will contain material which might impinge on the acas code and conversely as i said earlier <e> <s> therefore it seems appropriate to have this dual possibility so that the codes would not come into conflict but the latter would supersede the earlier one so far as necessary <e> <s> after all industrial relations is a developing subject <e> <s> one hopes indeed that it will develop further over the years <e> <s> in order not to cramp the style of development clauses of the sort contained in clause so far as the acas codes are concerned and contained in schedule so far as the secretary of states codes are concerned are appropriate <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy has described the bridlington procedures as an attempt to bring order into the chaos of the british trade union structure <e> <s> certainly the government strongly support action which has that desirable effect and they believe that the bridlington procedures have a great part to play in that operation <e> <s> therefore they see great value in them and i give the unreserved assurance that there is no intention whatsoever in this bill on the part of the government to undermine those procedures <e>", "<cs> i should like to express hearty appreciation <e>", "<cs> the end which the noble and learned lords amendment is designed to serve is we agree likely to be the end which would be reached but we do not think the amendment is necessary in order to reach it <e> <s> regulations governing the tribunals procedure presently give the tribunal discretion to stay proceedings and certainly this would apply if the high court was being asked to determine the <e>", "<cs> i think i can say with the fullest possible conviction that the reason the government proposed that there should lie an appeal on fact to the employment appeal tribunal in these cases was not in order to provide work for lawyers but rather because they thought these particular cases were of sufficient importance to merit a special appeal procedure <e> <s> as has been said there were cases of unfair dismissal before the tribunals in <e> <s> it would obviously be impracticable for a rehearing to be available in the employment appeal tribunal in such a tremendous number of cases but one hopes that the cases under clause would be very much smaller in number even though they are potentially of great importance <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wedderburn has just said in an unfair dismissal case if one has lost ones job it may have very serious continuing effects depending on the situation <e> <s> but the cases with which clause is concerned are cases in which people may well face the loss of their whole career or their chosen trade because of their exclusion or expulsion from a trade union in an industry or trade which is highly organised by the union concerned <e>", "<cs> i think it is right that i should make it absolutely plain that the government have every confidence in industrial tribunals <e> <s> the fact that in certain cases of particular sensitivity there should be allowed a rehearing is in no way an insult to the industrial tribunals <e> <s> the employment appeal tribunal would have the tremendous advantage of having the views of the industrial tribunal before it <e> <s> the government have every confidence in industrial tribunals and consider that they are doing an excellent job <e> <s> but we consider that in a case where the unions may have very important issues at stake as would arise under clause it is right that they should have an opportunity of a rehearing just as the individual would have in such cases <e>", "<cs> i should be glad to try to assist in this matter if i could but i regret to say that i find it hard to understand the place of this proviso in this clause <e> <s> the reason for the clause is to deal with the situation where no reply is received <e> <s> this proviso seems to me to raise the kind of classical situation in which it would be very easy to give a reply <e> <s> i find it difficult to know why the clause about time should be qualified by this proviso as regards which it is easiest of all to give a reply because the person apparently on the face of the matter is not qualified <e> <s> one would expect the union in that case to reply by return <e> <s> so i find it very hard to see what this has to do with the subject matter of the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass and in so doing i should like to thank my noble friend for his comments of a few moments ago <e> <s> i very much appreciate what he had to say <e>", "<cs> the governments answer to this amendment is similar to the answer which i gave to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the justification which the noble lord lord wedderburn put for the amendment is that it would be entirely reasonable that an application which was founded on circumstances such as those should be refused <e> <s> what we say is that it is far better that the general principle of reasonableness should be the test than that the bill should be cluttered up with a lot of particular cases <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble baroness has said may i add that we contemplate a code of practice in which it would be possible after discussion to deal in a much more appropriate way with a large number of particular cases perhaps as illustrations of the general principles <e>", "<cs> i think that it has already been made clear that the government very seriously considered the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord lord shinwell that i am sure we would all agree that in view of his lifes work he well deserves a free union card <e> <s> as regards the present situation the government have made it abundantly plain that they would not want the matter to be dragged forward prematurely to the industrial tribunal <e> <s> that is not the purpose of their present structure <e> <s> the fact that they have extended the period within which a complainant may go to the industrial tribunal to permit of these procedures being gone through is i think eloquent evidence of that <e> <s> so the matter has been seriously considered <e> <s> it is a matter of course which will be dealt with in the code of practice but the question as to whether we can accept the amendment goes rather further <e>", "<cs> in the situation of which i am speaking there is no express answer from the union until the procedures have been exhausted in the union <e> <s> of course it is for that reason that we need a reasonable time provision which is the subsection that we debated earlier <e> <s> therefore if the union rules have the structure that on an application being made there is no effective answer until all the procedures have been gone through and it only becomes final and definitive at that stage <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i am not sure that i completely understand that <e>", "<cs> to take the one case of exclusion i do not want to complicate matters by taking both the present structure is that the complaint becomes competent once there is an exclusion by the union <e> <s> depending on the form of the union rule that exclusion may be at the level of first instance if i can call it that or only after all appeals have been gone through <e> <s> the right of appeal may well render ineffective the decision at first instance until the appeal is disposed of <e> <s> in that case there is no exclusion until that happens <e> <s> of course we have said that where an applicant in that situation does not receive an answer on the point after a reasonable time he can treat his application as having been refused therefore effectively the present structure gives the union a reasonable time to go through its own internal procedures and decide the question if it adopts this form of machinery <e>", "<cs> i entirely appreciate that and that is the reason for the procedures to obtain compensation with particularly enhanced compensation if the industrial tribunal orders reinstatement and the employer refuses to make it <e> <s> therefore what i am really aiming at is this <e> <s> however good these procedures may be they do not eliminate the need for some procedure which ultimately gives rise to compensation for the individual <e> <s> in this field as in many others to delay too long the individuals right to receive his compensation is to deny him justice delaying justice for long is to deny justice <e> <s> i am sure that those who warmly supported the noble lord lord wade in his promotion of the bill of rights will remember that one of the provisions of the convention on human rights is that everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent <e>", "<cs> the government have considerable sympathy with the reasons for which this amendment is moved <e> <s> we were grateful to the noble lord lord howie of troon for raising this matter at second reading <e> <s> my noble friend lord gowrie replied briefly on that occasion and we have sought to re-examine the matter since then <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that my noble friend felt that the response i had given was not adequate <e> <s> i said on behalf of the government and i repeat that we certainly appreciate very much the great importance of this problem <e> <s> i do not think we differ at all from the noble lord lord howie from the noble baroness lady seear or from my noble friend on this matter <e> <s> the only question that arises concerns the best way of dealing with it <e>", "<cs> although technically we are speaking to amendment no <e> <s> perhaps i can range a little more widely to save time later <e> <s> the situation is that cases of appeal over unreasonable exclusion or expulsion from a trade union under clause are subject to a two-stage procedure <e> <s> first of all an industrial tribunal will give a declaration of rights regarding membership <e> <s> whether or not a union complies with this an issue of compensation might arise although often the applicant will simply want his union card in order to prevent loss of his job <e> <s> the procedure recognises this by requiring a separate and subsequent claim for compensation to be made and a time-lag between the determination by an industrial tribunal and that claim <e>", "<cs> i think this matter has been very thoroughly considered before we have come to this point and therefore i do not think i could do more than say what i have said already <e>", "<cs> the situation which is provided for in these amendments is a situation which i suppose could happen although generally speaking we would think that a person would be content with one or other but if a person in the common law case wrote to the high court we believe that the court would follow its normal practice in awarding any damages to a successful plaintiff by calculating the loss suffered by him as a result of the defendants wrongful treatment <e> <s> the calculation of the loss <e>", "<cs> i think the substantial matters which have arisen on this clause have been the subject of debates in relation to the amendments and i am grateful that we saved time by taking a division on all of them at once so i do not wish to waste time now <e> <s> i am happy to accept the suggestion made by the noble lord lord wigoder that i should deal with this question in due course <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to be lengthy and i do not know that i shall necessarily be profound <e> <s> i must say that i agree with my noble friend that this is not an amendment of great practical importance because i do not believe that to practising lawyers the onus of proof is often important <e> <s> i believe that in most cases the court has sufficient evidence not to rely on onus and i think that i can back that by statements of great authority from practising lawyers through the years <e> <s> this is so even in the ordinary courts and the industrial tribunals are special in this respect because they have much more opportunity for an inquisitorial role than has the ordinary court <e> <s> the fact that the onus has been expressed until now in the way that it has the guilty until proved innocent point that the noble lord lord wedderburn referred to is in our view important <e>", "<cs> may i say that this amendment applies to businesses large or small it is exactly the same in all situations <e> <s> i do not think that in this particular amendment these considerations are relevant <e>", "<cs> this appears to be an extremely technical question and i have tried to follow the explanation of the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> however i find it hard to reconcile his explanation with this amendment particularly as the amendment finishes up with these words <e>", "<cs> the governments view on this matter is that introduction of a new closed shop marks a very substantial change in the terms and conditions of employment and it is right and sensible that that should happen only when a very large percentage of those who will be affected by it vote in its favour <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> figure was <e>", "<cs> the only figures i referred to are those in the bill coupled with the example given which is just a pure matter of arithmetic <e>", "<cs> we understand the matter that the noble lord wishes to raise but we believe that this amendment is not a good one for perhaps two main reasons <e> <s> first it imposes conditions on the holding of a ballot which are likely only to give rise to dissention and disruption <e> <s> as formulated the new clause dealing with ballots sets few conditions <e> <s> it stipulates that the persons entitled to vote shall be those in the class potentially to be covered by the agreement and it stipulates that all those so far as reasonably practicable shall have the opportunity of voting in secret <e> <s> those are the essential requirements <e> <s> other details are for the employer to resolve usually in discussion with the union or unions involved and we would hope that the code of practice on the closed shop would be of further assistance on these practical matters <e>", "<cs> the questions raised by the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton are quite difficult ones <e> <s> we do not believe that the courts would willingly entertain an action in tort when the individual bringing it had a clear remedy under statute and that would seem to be the position not necessarily in all the examples he gave but certainly in the general area covered by the amendment <e> <s> in the case considered by the amendment both the employee dismissed and the employer induced to dismiss would have remedies under the bill in clauses and respectively <e> <s> the court of appeals ruling in <e>", "<cs> as is obvious the reason for requiring employers and associated employers to aggregate their employees for the purposes of this clause is to prevent abuse of the provision by employers <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble lord lord wadderburn believes that the amendment would widen the scope of the aggregation of employees required by this clause <e> <s> i would suggest however that it is not clear and that the amendment might well have the effect of narrowing the circumstances in which employers would be required to add people in <e>", "<cs> i have chosen this example for the simple reason that it illustrates the point we are trying to get at <e> <s> i am taking this in order to illustrate the nature of the conduct that is in question which can be used to reduce the award <e> <s> that is the reason i have taken this particular example <e> <s> the important point i want to make is <e>", "<cs> it is perhaps as well in view of the intervention when i was speaking last that i should make it plain that what we are seeking to do by the parts of the clause challenged in this amendment is to abolish the minimum basic award not to abolish the basic award <e> <s> the government can see no justification in principle why an employee should receive a minimum basic award of two weeks pay when he is not entitled to do so by reason of his age and length of service or on those rare occasions when his actions have been such that it is just and equitable that his award should be reduced below this point <e> <s> we cannot see any good reason why there must be a minimum basic award when he is not otherwise entitled to it <e> <s> therefore we invite the committee to reject these amendments <e>", "<cs> the view which my noble friend has just expressed is essentially the view that we hold with regard to the amendment <e> <s> as noble lords will recall we amended this clause to make it clear that where another party is to be joined it must happen before the hearing of the complaint <e> <s> that is in order to ensure that the person who is joined will have an opportunity to participate in the hearing <e> <s> once the person is joined before the hearing it seems obvious that he must be entitled to be heard on any matter which affects his interest <e> <s> the decision on whether or not the dismissal was unfair is a matter which directly affects the interest of the person who is joined <e> <s> so our view is that it is unnecessary for this to be added to the bill <e>", "<cs> the situation is that section of the act is not intended in any way to be interfered with <e> <s> accordingly the procedure is that all three parties the complainer the employer and let us say the union will be present at the hearing <e> <s> one would expect the complainants evidence to come first the employers evidence to come second and the case for the union to come third <e> <s> in coming to its determination the tribunal will pay attention to section and in determining the issue of unfair dismissal it will not have regard to any evidence about pressure <e> <s> the tribunals are very much respected and we believe they are perfectly capable of considering the evidence relevant to the question and ignoring evidence which is not relevant to that question <e> <s> then when they come on to the second question they will look at the evidence relating to that <e>", "<cs> it would obviously be a fairly extreme case in which the tribunal would feel that the whole responsibility for an unfair dismissal should ultimately be passed to a union but that such a case could arise is obvious and the government cannot see the justification for an arbitrary limit to be set to the proportion of compensation for which a joined party should be responsible <e> <s> accordingly we cannot see any logic at all in this amendment and we invite the committee to reject it <e>", "<cs> it seems plain that in view of the provisions of clause of the bill a provision of the sort that we have in clause is essential and it appears right in principle in any case where a union or other person takes action which has the result of forcing employers to dismiss people unfairly that those who take such action should bear at least part of the responsibility for it <e> <s> in our view the clause goes no further than is necessary for this purpose and provides a simple procedure with one hearing and so on as we have discussed already in which to determine the matter <e>", "<cs> the act recognises there might be a possible conflict between an individuals right to organise and participate in the union of his choice and the stability of existing collective bargaining arrangements <e> <s> the compromise currently is that rights to use the employers premises are limited where there is union membership agreement to activity on behalf of unions covered in that agreement <e> <s> the government intend that after the bill is enacted union membership agreements should be introduced only after the ballot to which we have already referred <e> <s> the government cannot accept that any other new union membership agreement should be used as a justification for limiting the rights of members of non-specified unions <e>", "<cs> i think that we have discussed in principle most of what the noble lord has said in this part of his argument <e> <s> he has given a number of examples but i should have thought that action short of dismissal is not the most important part to give attention to <e> <s> it is action short of dismissal for the purpose of compelling a person to join the union <e> <s> really those who oppose this clause are standing up for compulsion in this situation because the noble lord lord wedderburn has explained to us that even with the best will in the world you get a number of cases of people who are subject to this per cent <e> <s> i think he said not capable of being dealt with under the present arrangements <e> <s> if this clause goes no help is given in these cases at all <e> <s> i invite your lordships to agree that this clause should stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i have no reason to believe that the judges in the court of appeal or the court of session are not capable of understanding the realities of industrial relations especially when they are eloquently explained to them on both sides of any case by people who are very familiar with them <e> <s> i believe the judges are capable of recognising compulsion when they see it and of course i perfectly understand that one does not need to put people in shackles to have effective compulsion <e> <s> the judges are perfectly capable of recognising compulsion and it is against compulsion that this clause stands <e>", "<cs> in my submission the main disadvantage of the amendment is the uncertainty it would create <e> <s> at present the affect of subsection of the clause is quite clear <e> <s> it says in effect if someone pickets other than at his own place of work he forfeits the immunities provided by section of the trade union and labour relations act <e> <s> that is perfectly straight-forward <e> <s> i accept that the main immunity is that for inducing a breach of a contract conferred by section <e> <s> it is that subsection which is nearly always at issue in these cases <e> <s> but if we were to accept the amendment we should be creating the impression that parliament intended some immunity to remain under section for secondary picketing without specifying what that immunity was <e>", "<cs> we have used the words in the course of picketing in this clause because they express neatly and precisely what we want to achieve <e> <s> our aim is to remove immunity from pickets who in the course of picketing other than at their own place of work induce a breach of contract <e> <s> we are not concerned in this clause with people who attend at a place of work for some other purpose and this really is the point <e> <s> we are advised that if we use some formula other than in the course of picketing such as the one suggested in this amendment we might by mistake restrict activities other than picketing for example the right of a shop steward from a particular factory to address a meeting of workers at the gates to another workplace <e> <s> in other words we have used in the course of picketing in order to reduce the chances of misinterpretation <e>", "<cs> in our submission this is a misleading and potentially dangerous amendment <e> <s> section of the act and clause of the bill which would amend that section are concerned with the civil law not in our submission with the criminal law <e> <s> as the attorney-general said in another place in a statement on th february which was repeated in your lordships house by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor and with which i agreed as representing the principles of the law of scotland <e>", "<cs> the position of action described in the amendment is quite clear under the clause as drafted <e> <s> whether it is lawful or not depends on what is its principal purpose and whether it is likely to achieve that purpose <e> <s> if the principal purpose of the secondary action is to prevent or disrupt the supply of goods or services during the dispute and it is likely to achieve that purpose then it will be protected even if there are consequential effects after the dispute is over <e> <s> it will of course often be the case that there are some temporary spillover effects after the dispute is over while the position is getting back to normal <e> <s> that is true of primary action and of course we accept that such effects may be the consequence of lawful secondary action <e> <s> so long as they are consequential effects of secondary action which met the requirements of subsections or <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has pointed out this amendment would have the effect of both widening the scope for secondary action and also we would suggest introducing a substantial element of uncertainty into what is as drafted a precise definition in subsection <e>", "<cs> so far as i understand the argument to which we have just listened the noble lord lord wedderburn seems to assume that the existence of some agent middle man or carrier will mean that there is no direct contract between the two employers <e>", "<cs> in that case i have not understood what the noble lord has been saying <e> <s> it may well be my fault but that is certainly how i understood him <e> <s> in any case it seems to me that the essence of this matter is that the contractual relationship is required before one comes into clause at all and before one comes into the underlying tort which gives rise to this question <e> <s> therefore i hold to the view and i am sorry if i have misunderstood the noble lords argument on this matter that the only reasonable basis on which the secondary action can be defined is by reference to existing contracts between them defining the first supplier or first customer in that way <e>", "<cs> we are concerned in this amendment with the meaning of the words <e>", "<cs> i must confess to having a good deal of difficulty in understanding the new clause and its effect <e> <s> it talks in subsection of liability arising other than liability in tort and criminal liability and then in subsection it goes on effectively to say that liability in tort is not to arise in that case <e> <s> i think i understand the point that the noble lord is aiming at but i am not certain that the clause deals with it effectively <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has explained the effect of this amendment and it is a most important effect is that it would remove the residual discretion which section has left to the courts in deciding whether or not to grant an injunction <e> <s> as a result of this amendment if it were approved the court would no longer in exercising its discretion whether or not to grant an injunction have regard to the likelihood of the defendant arguing successfully in a full trial that he acted in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute <e> <s> instead of that if the likelihood was established at the interim hearing the court would have no option but to refuse to grant an injunction <e>", "<cs> i will not weary your lordships by going again into general matters but so far as the cost of taxation which i think is the main new point which the noble baroness has raised is concerned this is the point which the government are making <e> <s> this is the reason why it will take some time to introduce the scheme <e> <s> the government hope that their proposals will be reasonably cheap and economic to apply to the benefits in question <e> <s> that is the reason why we cannot bring in the system now and why we shall have to wait until at least before it applies <e>", "<cs> i think that noble lords could rely on the government not to tax for taxations sake <e> <s> in other words unless there is a reasonable yield having regard to its cost the government would not be inclined to bring it in <e> <s> it is fairly plain as the noble baroness said that there is no intention of having a tax system simply for the purpose of punishing people <e> <s> the tax system is designed to produce revenue for the state <e> <s> it is only if these changes would produce a net revenue for the state that there would be any question of bringing them in <e>", "<cs> i should like to deal first with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as the noble lord lord banks has explained the intention of the amendment seems to be to provide that spells of incapacity shall link with each other if they are not separated by more than weeks <e> <s> but the wording of the amendment would not achieve that objective <e> <s> it would not be practicable because it fails to take account of the fact that a period of interruption of employment can extend over several years and can include both spells of incapacity and spells of unemployment <e> <s> a period can therefore comprise days of incapacity for work even though the latest spell is a spell of unemployment <e>", "<cs> may i just say that a great deal of what has been said recently has nothing at all to do with the amendment <e> <s> so far as this amendment is concerned i cannot accept for a moment that there is anything iniquitous about taking account of an income tax refund as a resource when it is a question of need that is being assessed <e> <s> so far as the point is concerned in this clause all that has been said is that if a union pays <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord is thinking of amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am sure we are all glad to know that the noble lord lord wells-pestell is going to address us once more and that his threat that his present speech was the last one has turned out to be incorrect <e> <s> so far as this particular amendment is concerned the governments intention is to implement the proposals in clause of this bill at the same time as the changes in the rules for supplementary benefits introduced by the social security act become operative namely th november <e> <s> that is the intention <e> <s> however we feel that we should be able to keep our options open and be able to introduce the new rules for strikers benefits at an earlier date than november if the industrial situation should ever require it <e> <s> it is not that we anticipate anything in the nature of panic but we would think it appropriate if the industrial situation would appear to require it that the power should exist to bring these special rules into effect <e> <s> we do not expect ever to have to make use of this subsection but we do think it wise to preserve this freedom and i therefore invite your lordships not to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> as has been explained by the noble lord lord wells-pestell the proposed new clause would place on the secretary of state an obligation to improve as best he can the take-up of supplementary benefit among those becoming entitled because of reduction in their contributory benefits <e> <s> the amendment draws attention as does the explanatory memorandum to the bill to the fact that there will be some increase in supplementary benefit claims extra beneficiaries as a result of clauses and about a per cent <e> <s> increase in the existing case load <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for these suggestions and i shall certainly draw them to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords the lord chancellors speech is very much more authoritative than anything i could say about it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important in seeking to deal with this amendment to stress as i did when i dealt with a somewhat similar point in committee that the subsection into which the amendment proposes to insert a reference into what i shall call for short the bridlington procedures is a subsection which provides that a provision in an agreement shall be void in so far as it purports to exclude or limit the operation of read short the rights conferred by the clause <e> <s> so far i have not heard any justification for the view that the tucs disputes principles and procedures do anything of the kind and if they do not do anything of the kind then there is no need to exclude them from the operation of this provision <e> <s> the principle of clause ii appears to be absolutely self-evident if you confer general rights by statute then it ought not be be possible for people to evade that by making private contracts not to exercise those rights and we understood that we had the agreement of the noble lords friends in another place to that principle when the matter was debated there <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i will take amendments nos <e> <s> and together as the noble lord lord mccarthy did <e> <s> where the individual in question has been admitted or re-admitted to the union after a declaration by a tribunal and he seeks compensation the compensation awarded by the tribunal will be that considered <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton has said we have already been over this ground <e> <s> i certainly appreciate the attempt he has <e>", "<cs> my lords what will be in the green paper is for another day <e> <s> so far as this particular amendment is concerned i really understood the noble lord lord wedderburn ultimately to see good sense including bill and george in the voting and ask your lordships to agree to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter which is now before your lordships is the same point essentially as the noble lord raised on <e>", "<cs> i think that has been made clear <e> <s> i must say i think it is the same point and that is why i am seeking to address it in this particular way <e> <s> if the doubt the noble lord has given expression to were to eventuate the legal position of all union membership agreements would be uncertain and this would be both confusing and disruptive <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to be engaging and if possible relaxed and that of course is the procedure we think the tribunal should have a relaxed procedure without tremendous constraints imposed unnecessarily by parliament <e> <s> section of the act is left untouched and accordingly the question of unfair dismissal must be determined apart from any question of pressure <e> <s> but why do the tribunal need to have directions that they must first determine whether or not the dismissal was unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords as for the amendment which is all i propose to deal with i would certainly suggest that it is unlikely that an employer will change the character of the people working for him once he gets to the number which is important for this clause and i do not think he would do it for that purpose alone he might of course have other reasons and the noble lord lord wedderburn referred to those but we are not dealing with those here <e> <s> the important point from our point of view is that the clause is dealing with the burden of the employment protection legislation and it seems highly relevant in that context to use the employee as the person who is important for the purpose of counting numbers <e> <s> if one were dealing with some other form of protection the workers might be important <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard it said that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds but whether that would apply in this context i would not say <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that clause deals with a situation somewhat different from that with which we are concerned here <e> <s> perhaps i might be allowed to leave it at that at least at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter seems to be causing undue difficulty to noble lords opposite <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor said earlier the test is one of plain english whether the action in question was for the purpose of compelling the person affected to be or to become a member of a trade union <e> <s> surely that is a test which is reasonably easy to apply and as my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor said on the last occasion the judges do not have much difficulty in determining what is the purpose <e> <s> surely it is easier to leave it on that general test than to try to test it in relation to particular examples as this amendment seeks to do <e> <s> the amendment suggests that it should not be such action if the action is by reason only that it affords to workers who are members of an independent trade union a benefit or advantage which is not afforded to that employee <e> <s> it must depend on the circumstances the nature of the benefit the way in which and the purpose particularly with which this course of conduct is pursued <e> <s> if the refusal of these benefits is part of a deliberate strategy to compel nonmembers to join by refusing them improvements in terms and conditions of employment that they would normally expect then this would fall foul of the clause <e> <s> i would therefore suggest that this amendment instead of helping matters only hinders matters and the simple test which is after all a test of previous legislation is much better and this amendment should not be given support <e>", "<cs> my lords i think at least some of the ground the noble lord has covered is ground that we have been over before <e> <s> our view of the matter is that peaceful persuasion peaceful argument as part of picketing never has been criminal <e> <s> since the noble lord referred to citrine perhaps i could refer to his comment in the third edition at pages and on section of the act where he says <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i understand the noble lords question <e> <s> i find difficulty in understanding what relationship it has to the amendment he has proposed <e> <s> my understanding of the situation is that in <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have understood correctly the examples that the noble lord lord mccarthy has given the clause would already take account of that kind of support <e> <s> the clause permits attempts to persuade employees of customers or suppliers to an employer in dispute to <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear from the amendment itself and the explanation that the noble lord has given of it that he wishes to destroy what has been described as the objective test in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may answer that point <e> <s> it is not only a question of ease or difficulty in applying the test it is the result of applying the test that it is important <e> <s> if it is genuine intention it is unlimited because one can intend almost anything <e> <s> if it is what is likely to be achieved it is limited and that is what we seek to achieve here <e>", "<cs> my lords as i see it the crux of this matter is that the secondary action will be lawful only if the employees in question are the employees of the employer whose business is being disrupted <e> <s> in other words employees can lawfully interfere directly with their own employers business with the employer in dispute and in no other way <e> <s> that seems to us to be a reasonable restriction and it is the purpose of the clause to achieve that <e> <s> accordingly i invite your lordships to reject both amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has explained this amendment is aimed at what may be termed for short the anti-union employer <e> <s> i should say at the outset that the government have no sympathy with employers who prevent their workers from joining trade unions if that is what the workers want to do <e> <s> nothing in this bill is intended to encourage such attitudes among employers <e> <s> we believe that all workers should be free to join trade unions if they choose to do so of their own free will <e> <s> but we believe that they should be free from compulsion or coercion of any sort whether from employers trade unions or other workers <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the noble lord he is putting forward this amendment to prevent industrial action in pursuance of an agreement rendered void by the bill from being unlawful <e> <s> the only agreements made void by the bill are those which purport to exclude or limit the operation of clauses or which deal with unreasonable exclusion or expulsion from a trade union by virtue of clause of the bill as he has said <e> <s> indeed as is clear from clause the range of possible agreements rendered void by that clause is very limited <e> <s> in our view the result is that the range of possible industrial action to which this amendment refers is very limited indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords that is my understanding of the effect of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i referred to section <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps apparent that the noble lord had not read clause sufficiently far there is a paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation so far as we are concerned is that section <e>", "<cs> it is quite plain that the ultimate source of the money for the specialised services to which the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead and the noble baroness lady masham of ilton have referred is with the secretary of state and the question is whether it should go directly to a particular specialised unit or come down through the regional authority <e> <s> the difficulty is that people concerned with a specialised unit have concern that they should get what they consider that unit requires <e> <s> local managers and authorities on the other hand have pointed to the fact that you can get too many costly specialised units which are difficult to control and which tend possibly to interfere with other priorities and accordingly to get a balance between spending on specialised services and spending on more general services you must in our view have proper local decision-making <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as consultation is concerned early consultation between scottish and english draftsmen takes place at the present time <e> <s> i am satisfied with the arrangements for that <e> <s> i think that it would be impossible for the lord advocate to be satisfied with the number of scottish draftsmen that are available but considering the difficulties the department have had in recent years particularly with the sudden death of the legal secretary the department is very well staffed <e>", "<cs> my lords there are advantages in parallel bills and disadvantages also particularly in the shape of the requirements made on parliamentary time <e> <s> we have tried to balance these various considerations in making decisions in particular cases <e> <s> i am glad to know that the demand for the renton committee report has been so great <e> <s> several reprints have been called for since the original publication <e> <s> i had gathered that the demand had now slightly fallen off and that recently a further reprint was not considered justified <e> <s> copies can be obtained by arrangement with her majestys stationery office but the situation is kept under constant review <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the government have had the report reprinted several times <e> <s> the demand for it appeared to be reasonably satisfied although it happens to be out of print at the moment <e> <s> if there should be a resurgence of demand the government will meet it <e> <s> individual copies are available by arrangement with her majestys stationery office <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is fair to say that at the moment legislation is printed in the two different languages as far as that may be necessary as i am sure the noble lord will know as a result of referring to the tenants rights etc <e> <s> scotland bill which the house is presently considering <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i cannot answer that question immediately but i hope i shall be able to do so in a little while <e>", "<cs> i perhaps should say that the information for which the noble baroness lady david asked is not quite the same information as that which is asked for by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> so far as the information that he has <e>", "<cs> there are certainly to be consultations with ilea about the form of information required <e> <s> so far as this particular proposal is concerned it is a proposal which would lead only in the first instance to a code affecting ilea <e> <s> there will of course be consultation about the form of information that might be provided <e>", "<cs> there has certainly been a good deal of consultation with the scottish local authorities already on this subject <e>", "<cs> i accept that but the consultations will certainly go on <e> <s> the secretary of state for scotland is very anxious to proceed by agreement if possible <e> <s> that has always been his object in this particular exercise <e> <s> it is the reason that these powers were not sought in the first instance <e> <s> at present it looks as though agreement may not be possible and therefore it is wise to take these powers <e> <s> it does not at all mean that consultation will not continue <e>", "<cs> i think that the primary consultation about ilea was with the glc and from that it seems to have emerged that there was considerable scope for separating the functions of ilea in relation to information from the others <e> <s> indeed from amendment no <e> <s> which was put down i had rather taken it that this was a view which was shared by noble friends of the noble baroness opposite and it certainly seems to me to be a reasonable idea in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> too welcome the amendment in the sense that it draws to our attention the need for public bodies local authorities in particular to account for their performance as employers particularly in relation to the disabled <e> <s> in the course of the public consultations which we have held on the publication of information initiative we have received submissions on a wide variety of local authority activities which are felt to be worthy of public attention including the views of organisations <e>", "<cs> the attitude of the government to the manuscript amendment is that it appears to be acceptable in principle <e> <s> the object of the clause has been welcomed in various parts of the committee and i appreciate that <e> <s> it has been said that this particular amendment might help achieve the object of the clause at the same time cutting out unnecessary duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy in trying to implement or achieve that objective <e> <s> the noble baroness lady david said she would like some further time to consider it and i should like to have the same <e> <s> so my attitude to this is that we should like to have the opportunity to consider it <e> <s> the principle appears very acceptable and i should be glad if the noble viscount feels able to withdraw the amendment on that understanding <e>", "<cs> i think that it is apparent that my noble friend lord sandford and i are agreed that there is a great deal of force to commend the codes in this area being voluntary codes <e> <s> there is nothing in the later part of the clause which departs from that except in the event that these voluntary codes do not manifest themselves in the general practice of local authorities <e> <s> accordingly where we differ is really on what happens then <e>", "<cs> following the governments original consultation document issued last october a substantial number of organisations and individuals contributed views including nalgo <e> <s> since then a draft code of practice has been prepared upon which we invited the comments of selected bodies including the trade unions while it was still at the formative stage <e> <s> the unions initial comments were constructive and we await any further views they may have on the draft code of practice and consultation document which has now been published and on the issue of short period indicators of performance which were discussed in a meeting between the secretary of state and local government union representatives <e> <s> the tuc have also been invited by my right honourable friend to meet with officials of his department to discuss possible arrangements for the publication of information and i understand this meeting is to take place at the end of this week <e>", "<cs> i had understood that the noble lord lord ross of marnock was supporting this amendment i think it is down in his name <e> <s> i had explained earlier that the secretary of state for scotland had consulted with the convention of scottish local authorities cosla in the hope of reaching agreement on arrangements for the publication of this information which would not require any code except the agreement <e> <s> unfortunately so far at least it has not been possible to reach complete agreement in relation to these matters <e> <s> that does not at all mean that the secretary of state for scotland is not hoping still that a voluntary code will be possible and that is what he certainly does hope for <e> <s> it is at that stage the stage of issuing a draft code that consultation would normally arise <e> <s> that is certainly what would happen here <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> the purpose of clause is that local authorities and the other bodies to which the clause applies will give information about their activities to those who require that information in order to assess those activities <e> <s> there is no intention of requiring information in order that the local authorities may cut services as the noble lord lord ross of marnock put it <e> <s> the purpose of this clause is that local authorities should provide the basic information about their functions to ratepayers councillors local interest groups and the community at large as appropriate <e> <s> i must say that i do not see any reason why that principle should not be as equally applicable in scotland as it is in england and wales <e> <s> if the scottish local authorities by universal agreement were prepared to do that well and good <e> <s> but at least at present it looks as though that may not be possible to achieve by agreement <e>", "<cs> i think that i have said this once or twice but i have no real objection to repeating it <e> <s> it was thought that it would be unnecessary to have recourse to this clause at that stage because it was hoped that we would be able to reach this particular position by agreement with all the local authorities <e> <s> unfortunately so far that has not proved possible and that is why we are going along this particular road <e>", "<cs> i recognise fully the concern that my noble friend lord sandford has in tabling this amendment to our proposed new clause that we should try to consider the activities of local authorities as one <e> <s> but as i have asked the committee to accept it will be appropriate in our view for the minister of transport or the secretary of state for scotland in scotland to have the power to direct other public sector transport undertakings as to the information they should publish without of course detracting from the intention to hold full consultations before doing so <e>", "<cs> of course the precise form that the direction will take would affect the cost and that is still a matter to be considered <e> <s> i think i can assure the noble lord that the question of cost will not be lost sight of in considering the form of the <e>", "<cs> i must say i thought perhaps by implication i had tried to answer those questions in my previous remarks <e> <s> so far as a particular date is concerned by which an order for revaluation would be required i think that is very difficult to anticipate <e> <s> it depends on how successful the progress is towards fundamental reform and also of course depends on the extent to which the passage of time affects the validity of the existing list <e> <s> i accept that any passage <e>", "<cs> i recognise that section of the local government act gives rise to some anomalies and unfairnesses between one ratepayer and another <e> <s> the object of the provision was to simplify the rating valuation system by removing the necessity for making changes to the rateable values of properties every time small improvements are made <e> <s> it helps to keep down the costs of maintaining the valuation lists and reduces the inconvenience to householders of forms and inspections <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that i think this has been fairly fully considered and i do not think it would be very open of me to suggest that i could reconsider it <e>", "<cs> so far as clause is concerned the position is to make an improvement in the definition <e> <s> the point my noble friend was referring to perhaps arises more aptly under clause <e>", "<cs> as noble lords will appreciate the basis of the valuation of certain of the properties to which the clause relates will be on the basis of net rents and there may be changes in rateable values accordingly <e> <s> it is difficult to say by how much until one knows what the net rents in question are <e> <s> it is to provide for that possibility that the transitional provisions are in the clause <e>", "<cs> the clause as a whole is dealing with the situation of premises which are valued to gross at the moment and will be valued to net when the clause comes into effect <e> <s> these are premises which are non-industrial but are not domestic dwelling-houses speaking very generally <e> <s> it is premises of that sort which would be affected in this way and be valued by reference to net rents which might give a higher figure than the present one <e>", "<cs> this amendment would require the secretary of state to consult local government interests before exercising any of the powers conferred on him by clause <e> <s> this is the clause that provides for the possibility of a partial revaluation and the clause provides that in such an event the secretary of state shall prescribe an arithmetic multiplier that will be applied either to the revalued or to the non-revalued sector so as to preserve the overall balance of rateable value between the sectors <e> <s> the clause as drafted already places a duty on the secretary of state to consult local government and others about that adjustment <e> <s> it seems to us quite right that there should be consultation in this important professional matter and that is provided for <e>", "<cs> may i take the second point first <e> <s> the explanation which i gave was that the method required in the clause for adjusting as between the revalued and non-revalued sections is a rather special matter and it is a matter on which it was thought right that there should be special enactment of consultation because it is a matter that may affect not just the generality of local authorities but the particular formula may be required to take account of local circumstances <e> <s> on the other hand where the amendment goes much wider than that into general consultation in regard to the exercise of any power under this clause i was suggesting that the situation is a little different and that the general consultative machinery which is already in existence and which seems to work reasonably satisfactorily should be relied upon otherwise all the statutes referring to local government finance would be liberally sown with a somewhat similar provision to that in the amendment <e>", "<cs> this matter has indeed been further considered by the government since march <e> <s> i am very happy to be able to advise the committee to accept this and the other amendments that my noble friend lord colville will move as he has indicated <e> <s> this is an anomaly which over the years has generated a slow but steady stream of letters to the department of the environment and it is certainly a position which is very hard to defend <e> <s> nearly million people stand to benefit from this extension of domestic rate relief and it gives me particular pleasure therefore to be able to commend it to the committee <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord mottistone has made a powerful case for rate relief for what is sometimes described as premises or plant in mothballs <e> <s> listening to the arguments i think two strands can be distinguished <e> <s> first there is the case that if firms close down or cease to use certain production facilities in a factory clearly definable parts of a factory or pieces of plant and machinery are left unused <e> <s> the continuing rate liability in respect of those parts is then seen as a burden <e> <s> the possibility of rate relief is seen as a valuable source of respite for firms with diminished profits but with hope of restoration in time <e>", "<cs> i was seeking to assert that we indeed have the will but unfortunately have not been able to find the way <e> <s> i think that it is fair to remind your lordships that a similar amendment was proposed during the committee stage on this bill in another place and my right honourable friend the minister for local government and environmental services advised against the amendment <e> <s> that was some time ago and i think that the matter has been fairly fully considered <e> <s> therefore i do not think that i could encourage my noble friend to feel that there is much likely to come out of any further consideration of the matter <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend has said we propose to extend this to business ratepayers subject to a minimum and maximum sum to be specified by order <e> <s> the next amendment which i shall move seeks to give power to prescribe different sums for greater london than for other places for reasons which will perhaps be obvious <e> <s> the intention is that a suitable general maximum sum would be of rateable value as my noble friend has said <e> <s> that <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry if i have not explained the situation <e> <s> the act gave the local authority power to make grants to the disabled <e> <s> that expenditure therefore fell on the local authorities and what i have sought to try to explain is that this provision places a duty on the secretary of state to relieve the local authority of that expenditure to the extent of per cent <e> <s> that is a new provision it puts a new obligation on the secretary of state to make that relieving provision <e> <s> i hope i have made it clear this time <e>", "<cs> so far as i am concerned i am not particularly keen to get plaudits at this minute so if that is the purpose of the information then i do not mind that i have not got it to hand <e>", "<cs> i want to deal with the point that the noble lord lord davies has made <e> <s> the obligation laid on the secretary of state by this provision is to relieve the obligatory element not the discretionary element <e> <s> if the local authority give an extra discretionary element then that is not covered by this <e> <s> the provision is intended to relieve the local authorities of per cent <e> <s> of what i might call obligatory expenditure under the act <e>", "<cs> the main purpose of this part of the bill is to give the government an effective means of controlling the consumption of capital resources by local authorities <e> <s> where an authority acquire the right to use of occupy buildings or land they are using capital resources which could otherwise be used by the private sector <e> <s> as far as the control of public sector investment is concerned it makes no difference whether the authority own the freehold interest in the property or some other lesser interest so long as they occupy it to the exclusion of the private sector <e> <s> therefore clause provides that <e>", "<cs> the explanation for the situation here is really exactly the same as that covered by the principle i explained earlier <e> <s> as for the examples given by my noble friend i rather think that they too are covered by what i said about regulations because the intention is to deal with the situation whereby using such devices as he explained in fact the authority is acquiring an interest which is intended to be permanent under the guise of a succession of shortages and as i say the intention is to cover that by regulations <e>", "<cs> i am content to do that <e> <s> the explanation perhaps is that the value of the freehold interest is taken as the value and if it is a question of wayleave i do not think that would apply but i shall be glad to look at the matter <e>", "<cs> i think the question depends on the right to occupy <e> <s> if one has a right to occupy a mere statement of the intention that one does not intend to occupy would not be sufficient to attract the provision so the situation that is covered by this subsection as i understand it is the situation in which the authority has no right to occupy and it would not be able to disclaim that right merely by saying it has no intention of doing so <e>", "<cs> well i think that the principle then might be that one had to look at the agreement as a whole to see whether that kind of arrangement was inconsistent with the main idea of the contract or the lease <e> <s> for example if a person taking a lease was to contract that he had no right to occupy it would make nonsense of the main purpose of the contract and i doubt very much whether the kind of suggestion that the noble lord has made would in fact work <e>", "<cs> we very much understand the aims of the amendment and have considerable sympathy with them <e> <s> so far as the actual work of the district auditor is concerned and his duty to report we feel that the present existing statutory provisions are probably sufficient <e> <s> so far as publicity is concerned the idea that the full report should be published in a local newspaper would seem rather costly and perhaps impracticable in view of the length to which these reports often run and would probably be no more effective in bringing issues to public attention than is the substantial amount of publicity that auditors reports already receive through comment in the local press <e>", "<cs> the government view on this matter is that to repeal the community land act is so far as we are concerned to get rid of a good deal of unnecessary bureaucracy <e> <s> with regard to getting for the nation the development value of land the structure of the community land act is quite unnecessary for that purpose <e> <s> the development land tax obtains that for the nation <e>", "<cs> i am sure noble lords would think it right that every tax should often be reconsidered but the point i am making is that obtaining the development value for the nation is done by the development land tax and provided it is set at a realistic level then the initiative of those who hold the land will ensure that a reasonable supply of land comes forward <e> <s> there are ancillary provisions in the community land act which are of some utility in helping local authorities to buy land where circumstances so require and these we are retaining but the major structure of the act its bureaucratic need for intimation of every planning application to the local authority and saying what they are going to do about these as well as the requirement which may exist upon owners to notify the council whenever they are thinking of selling their property does not seem to be of any utility whatsoever <e> <s> it is also of some interest that a very considerable amount of the money which has been spent in relation to this act has been spent in administration <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will see your way to agreeing that clause shall stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i have listened closely to the noble lords explanation of the two amendments and we are well aware of his keen interest in the subject <e> <s> i regret that although i understand the point of view he has put forward i am not able to support his new clause not for the reason he referred to but for other reasons <e> <s> the concept underlying the first new clause is that property which was under threat of acquisition for or stood near to the designated route of a proposed road will have depreciated in value for that reason and that although a firm decision has been taken not to build the road owners should still be compensated for historic depreciation <e> <s> i find that a somewhat difficult concept to reconcile with the reasonably rigorous logic on which the compensation code is based <e> <s> the new clause would give the owner whose property is adversely affected by an order for a highway scheme a statutory entitlement to compensation but only if the order which has caused the depreciation is cancelled <e> <s> that does not seem to me a sound basis on which to found a new entitlement to compensation especially one which included rather special heads of compensation under which those eligible could well be more favourably treated than other owners who may at some stage actually be touched by a road scheme and have suffered actual loss <e>", "<cs> the principle involved in all these amendments is as my noble friend has explained the same <e> <s> a home loss payment or a farm loss payment is made in recognition of the upset and distress which is suffered by people who are compelled to move from a house or farm to which they have become attached over a number of years <e>", "<cs> i shall be glad to draw the remarks of my noble friend to the attention of the minister responsible <e> <s> it may be that in that situation there is some scope for a special case <e> <s> i cannot say that this will be so but i shall certainly draw his attention to those remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords the general practice of the crown office is not to give reasons for a decision not to prosecute <e> <s> obviously there are good reasons for that policy <e> <s> this statement did not contain an expres <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said that the only person who referred to a leak from the police was the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> on the information which i have i am not in a position to say from where the leak took place <e> <s> all i can do is to repeat that if evidence comes to light to indicate where it took place i would expect

proposed it we did not intend it to cover the very matters which the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton now wants to take out <e> <s> but this was a point about the clause which did not satisfy the honourable member in another place who moved it and he put to us the point which i am now seeking to put to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i think in practical terms the noble earls

say assuming that i am time barred please exercise your discretion in my favour <e> <s> so while i very much appreciate the help which the noble earl has given us on this occasion i do not think that this particular amendment is necessary to achieve the purpose because once the act comes into force as a practical matter a person who did not use the discretion at the right stage would simply be doubling the number of applications that he was making to the court <e> <s> so i do not really think that can possibly happen <e> <s> therefore i think the effect of the noble earls amendment is in fact already achieved in the clause and of course i am very anxious if possible to avoid the clause having to be re-examined anywhere else <e> <s> in the light of that explanation i hope that the noble earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are firmly of the view that consultation with all those involved who have something to contribute is an extremely useful exercise to engage in and not only do they have that as a view but they have sought to practise it in connection with this matter <e> <s> we have had so far as england and wales are concerned first of all two formal rounds of public consultation on this initiative and an initial consultation paper to which one at least of the local government unions responded and a second publication in the form of a draft code of practice <e> <s> before the latter code was issued in draft however the tuc and <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i do not think i

over ground which has already been covered <e> <s> the purpose of these provisions is to make general the good practice to which the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say straight away that we fully accept the importance of giving authorities adequate advance notice of the rate of return we have in mind they should earn and of any changes we might be planning to make from time to time to that rate <e> <s> i can give an unqualified <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord bellwin explained at committee stage we are seeking to provide a method of measuring <e>", "<cs> on the contrary my lords there will perhaps be even more stability available in the valuation list than under a revaluation system <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i do not carry any responsibility for sidetracking the noble baroness <e> <s> the amendment is very similar to one moved in committee but with respect i think it has been improved by reference to other bodies as well as to local authority associations <e> <s> notwithstanding that improvement which i acknowledge the government having considered the matter remain opposed to this amendment <e> <s> in practice we should of course in the event of a partial revaluation expect to consult widely on many aspects <e> <s> but the nature and timing of the consultation that might be needed must depend on the circumstances and the way in which the revaluation proposals are developed <e> <s> it would tie things down too tightly to insist on statutory consultation before any exercise of powers under this clause <e> <s> in the governments view it is better to leave the clause as it stands and to rely on the assurances that i have given that when the time comes there will be full consultation on all appropriate aspects when the powers of the clauses are exercised <e>", "<cs> my lords the present situation in england and wales and it is not very different in scotland so far as i recall is that statutes give local rating authorities full discretion to levy rates on empty property at up to per cent <e> <s> of ordinary rates subject to an initial free or grace period of three months the amendment would increase that to one year <e> <s> i should add that so far as current legislation is concerned newly-erected dwelling-houses have a six-month period of grace <e> <s> the government are far from unsympathetic towards those whose property stands empty longer than they would wish and who must pay rates they can ill afford <e> <s> such problems are all the greater especially for industry and commerce in times of economic difficulty <e> <s> noble lords will know however that the government have taken steps in the bill to improve their situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble baroness for reminding me of that point which i should have answered earlier <e> <s> the situation regarding crown property is that technically it is not liable to rates but the government pay a contribution in lieu of rates to the rating authority and the same sort of situation would apply so far as they are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has come back to this point with his usual vigour and has provided a new clause which attempts to deal with some of the matters i raised which i must say i do not regard as bureaucratic or as irresponsible <e> <s> the main provision that is made for dealing with the definition of an unused part of a hereditament is by providing that the rating authority <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i should like to say that i certainly do not wish to give any impression that i am not sympathetic to the matter which has been raised by my noble friends i hoped i had said that on the earlier occasion <e> <s> but i do believe that what is proposed here involves a fundamental difficulty of principle in giving this kind of relief through the rating system for the reasons i have sought to explain <e> <s> taking the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to answer that question <e> <s> so far as government property is concerned the situation is that being in the possession of the crown it is not subject to the rating law as that is laid down by statute but by agreement the government make a contribution in lieu of rates to the appropriate rating authority <e> <s> these matters are much more capable of being dealt with by a discretionary arrangement of that sort than they are under the terms of the statute <e> <s> of course the statute applies generally indiscriminately to all ratepayers and potential ratepayers <e> <s> the difficulty of applying that system the statutory system to the situation my noble friend lord mottistone has raised is our fundamental difficulty here <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has reminded your lordships we believe that the provisions already in the bill will benefit most of the business sector but that some limits are necessary to balance the help to businesses against the risk of damage to local authorities cash flow which in turn will affect their ratepayers <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the attitude taken by the noble baroness on the matter i think it would be best for me to say nothing at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the object of this provision is to suspend the operation of the provisions in a sense but i think it is wise in this particular area to use words which have themselves a definite effect <e> <s> what we want to achieve is that once the order is made the sections in question are treated as if they were repealed <e> <s> in the future it may be necessary to revive them in which case an order-making power is provided <e> <s> but the advice i have been given and i believe it is correct is that the wording that we have used here follows well-established precedent for a situation of this kind and that it would be undesirable to depart from it without justification <e> <s> i therefore hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw this amendment in the light of that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the various provisions against which these amendments are directed is to give the secretary of state some flexibility to help those whose property stands empty for longer than they would wish and who must pay rates that they can ill afford <e> <s> such problems are all the greater especially for industry and commerce in times of economic difficulties <e> <s> noble lords will appreciate that the government have taken steps in this bill to improve the situation <e> <s> although no immediate change is proposed the length of the grace period will be kept under review and i hope your lordships will feel that this is the right approach <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to say that the clause as the noble lord has proposed it i am speaking now of the first amendment is some improvement on his previous clause <e> <s> i instanced the difficulty about people who had bought a property just before the claim date as an illustration of the difficulty in principle of meeting the kind of claim that the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> although i acknowledge that the noble lord has improved the clause considerably in the respect which he has pointed out think that it remains illogical that people whose property was adversely affected by a scheme while in being and who could not claim compensation in that period should be awarded compensation when the scheme has been abandoned <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is fair to say that the noble earls amendment is to some extent in conflict with the amended clause as proposed and statutory sell-back provisions are very complicated indeed <e> <s> all i can say is that in making arrangements for getting rid of the property the minister of transport would certainly take account of all the interests involved <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware that is a proposal which has been made to cover this situation <e> <s> certainly it is a proposal which is worthy of consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords that depends upon the facts which are established <e> <s> certainly there is some doubt about the precise state of knowledge as the thalidomide difficulty developed and i certainly accept that some of the thalidomide victims might have been deprived of a remedy by a state of the art defence on the lines which i have just indicated i think that is reasonably clear but by no means all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the only answer that i was proposing to give at the moment <e> <s> as i have said this is a matter which will be the subject of negotiation and this is the position as we go forward in these negotiations <e> <s> the effect of the governments decision is that we shall maintain our general reserve on the draft directive during the discussions in the council working party <e> <s> we shall seek to persuade our partners to accept a state of the art defence and we shall seek a number of other changes where we feel that the existing text is defective <e> <s> a number of these have been mentioned and perhaps i may briefly indicate our attitude to them at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords since the strasbourg convention does not have a state of the art defence i certainly think it means that the decision of the government on this matter is incompatible with accession to the strasbourg convention <e> <s> of course at the moment that is a hypothetical question <e> <s> so far as i know no one has ratified the strasbourg convention yet <e> <s> in any event it would be necessary for us to follow out the negotiations on the directive and it is only then that the question of acceding or not to the strasbourg convention would become a realistic issue <e>", "<cs> my lords the attitude of the government on this point is that this matter ought to proceed if at all possible by agreement <e> <s> as the noble lord says under article agreement is required <e> <s> it is a very difficult area and i think this debate has demonstrated that there are very different views found to be held in various parts of the house they do not divide on any political basis <e> <s> they are views genuinely held having regard to peoples individual appreciations of these very difficult problems <e> <s> it is surely better if at all possible to proceed by way of agreement <e> <s> the object of a directive under article is to achieve harmonisation and surely if that is what we are aiming at it is very wise to attempt to proceed by agreement <e> <s> if the delays became unacceptably long <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should make it clear that her majestys government have no intention whatever of withdrawing from the existing convention on human rights with the jurisdiction of the commission and the european court of human rights <e> <s> indeed i do not think i understood anyone who has taken part in the debate in your lordships house so far to suggest that <e> <s> the only question is whether some additonal remedy should be available

convention <e>", "<cs> my lords i may not have made myself clear in which case i must apologise to your lordships for misleading you about the position i was trying to take up <e> <s> i was summarising the arguments in favour and against a bill of rights such as the noble lord lord wade has proposed <e> <s> but i have never understood this bill of rights to be in substitution for our accession to and ratification of the strasbourg convention <e> <s> in that her majestys government are at one with our predecessors <e> <s> the government have been fully committed to complying with the requirements of the convention subject to the derogations that have been entered to it and our one reservation <e> <s> i think as the noble lord lord boston of faversham said really we are all agreed about that and i certainly do not wish to cast any doubt upon that whatsoever <e>", "<cs> may i say first of all that the purpose of paragraph <e>", "<cs> this clause by amending section of the criminal procedure scotland act provides that in scotland a witness in a summary prosecution who wilfully fails to attend court after being duly cited or unlawfully refuses to be sworn or refuses to answer any question which the court may allow or to produce documents in his possession when required by the court or who prevaricates in his evidence shall be guilty of a criminal offence rather than being guilty of contempt of court <e> <s> on reflection i consider that this new provision would not work satisfactorily and that it would be advisable to retain unamended the present provisions of section which leaves this matter as a particular type of contempt of court and accordingly i invite the committee to agree that the clause should not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord lord gardiner has said this is a point at which the bill departs from the recommendations of the <e>", "<cs> my lords as has already been made clear the amendment which is before your lordships is substantially different from the one which was moved at the committee stage <e> <s> one point is underlined by that change and it is that this matter is concerned with contempt only incidentally <e> <s> as the amendment now makes clear it is primarily a question of the court not requiring a person in particular circumstances to disclose in other words it is a restriction on the compulsory answering of questions <e> <s> of course whatever be the rule about that matters of contempt may follow if a lawful question is put and the judge requires the witness to answer and he refuses <e> <s> then obviously that has consequences for contempt <e> <s> but i think it is proper to regard that as incidental to the main matter which is here in question <e> <s> accordingly we would certainly suggest to your lordships in the first instance that the amendment as now drafted is not really an amendment which directly relates to the subject matter of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i am trying to take account of what the right reverend prelate the bishop of london said on the last occasion and i am suggesting to the house that it is wise to take account of that and it would not be a balanced approach to the problem to single out publications for particular treatment on this occasion <e> <s> therefore what i would say in seeking to sum up the position from this point of view is that the present position as has been found by the committees that i have referred to and in the light of the granada decision is reasonably satisfactory and therefore best left alone so far as a contempt bill is concerned <e> <s> the amendment perhaps does not leave the flexibility which the present law leaves <e> <s> above all it singles out the publication for special treatment in the public interest while leaving many other areas of confidentiality which are equally important to different aspects of the public interest untouched <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of clause is to seek to give-somewhat more precision to this particular area of the law than it enjoys at present <e> <s> so far as the phillimore researches went it did not appear that there was much dissatisfaction with this particular area of the law of contempt from the point of view of confusion about its scope and <e>", "<cs> my lords the discussion of this matter at committee stage has

identified by the divisional court in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am referring at this moment to clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> it is my fault if the noble lord did not follow my argument <e> <s> the argument that i put forward is that there is an existing law of contempt <e> <s> we are not attempting to alter that law so far as clause is concerned except to add to that law a provision which deals with the mischief identified in the <e>", "<cs> my lords one way and the other we have been over the arguments about this matter on a number of occasions both in sittings on this bill and indeed earlier when various possible dates were under examination <e> <s> the point about the recent case to which the noble and learned lord lord gardiner referred is that so far as we can judge the matters to which he referred which he described as objectionable took place at a time which if this amendment were to pass would not be a time to which the strict liability rule would apply because they took place at the time of arrest <e> <s> we say that to choose the time of arrest is a very reasonable time to take <e> <s> it is a time which is likely to be important <e> <s> it is a time when a relationship with the court is set up and when in a real sense it can be said that the proceedings have properly begun in respect of which the protection is to apply <e> <s> accordingly so far at least our view is that the date in this bill which we have chosen both for england and wales and for scotland is correct but we will certainly continue to consider all that is said on the subject <e>", "<cs> i understood that perfectly <e> <s> my noble friend is much clearer than i am in expressing himself <e> <s> i understood exactly what he was saying <e> <s> the government in approaching this matter in principle and in substance did it with great care and considerable thought for the companies to which it will apply this is where i was going to deal more directly with the matter that my noble friend raised and in the execution of it they endeavoured to be careful too <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that the question of whether one uses historic cost current cost accounting or a mixture of the two is in our view primarily a matter for the professional judgment of the auditor and accountant but we will deal with that in more detail later because there is an amendment down which raises that point expressly <e> <s> therefore perhaps i may be excused from dealing with it in more detail at this juncture <e>", "<cs> certainly we will consider that <e> <s> it is a matter of discretion because one does not want to make the bill too long by explaining all that was in earlier bills on every occasion <e> <s> we had thought possibly wrongly that section would be pretty plain to almost anyone who had to deal with these matters <e> <s> section i think rings a bell with most people who have any idea of company accounts but we shall certainly consider the point <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for the very constructive way in which he moved this amendment and i should like to make it clear that we appreciate the help that is given in trying to get the right formulation for these rules which we hope will last for a considerable time <e> <s> but in this particular instance if i might answer the question of my noble friend lord hawke first of all whether it was realised or made that was the word used bank interest which had been paid by the customer would be properly covered in either case <e> <s> whether the loan itself had been repaid or not the interest which in that case would be presumably a measure of the profit would already have been realised if it had been paid <e>", "<cs> in that case i would think if the debt is a good one at that date it would be reasonable to take it into the account as something which is sufficiently definite in amount to be regarded as realised <e> <s> the provision we have used here is intended to reflect the meaning of the directive as we understand it <e> <s> i agree that the word actually used in the directive at this place is the word made but we have looked at this against the background of accountancy practice and the provision that we have adopted is intended as an expression of the well-understood prudence concept in the statement of standard accounting practice no <e> <s> under which profits are not anticipated but only recognised when there is sufficient certainty to make such recognition reasonable <e> <s> in this context realised does not <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord bruce asks leave to withdraw the amendment i should like to say that we will certainly consider the matter further and perhaps pursuing the noble lords illustration it would be easier to consider it in another situation other than just here <e> <s> we will certainly look at what the law society said <e> <s> we have considered it but we shall be happy to consider it further <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord lord bruce of donington opened his observations in this debate earlier in relation to clause he told us that he was all for flexibility and that the government were all for rigidity <e> <s> i think that at this stage of the debate it looks as though the tables have suddenly somewhat turned because what the government have sought to do in this bill is to take advantage of a flexibility which the fourth directive gives to enable a company if it thinks that is the best and the correct thing for it to use the current cost accounting method <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for his helpful intervention <e> <s> i agree that the amount of judgment required may vary but i still maintain that if you have to arrive at the market value of something which has not actually been sold that involves an element of judgment perhaps not a big element if a lot of these things are sold but at any rate some element of judgment <e> <s> the current cost accounting methods which have been developed by the profession over the years with a great deal of hard work are to be encouraged <e>", "<cs> i will have this checked but my understanding is that it would not be necessary to state if one is using the current cost accounting convention to arrive at the profit the final result of an historic cost accounting calculation <e> <s> but certain historic cost accounting information is required by the directive to be stated as a basic minimum <e> <s> there is a point about this i should stress i was just coming to it so the noble lords intervention was particularly timely <e> <s> this bill makes it the supreme test of accounts that they should show a true and fair view of the state of the company and that provision which takes precedence over all other requirements is in that position because of the efforts of the united kingdom negotiators on the directive <e>", "<cs> as i said the overriding necessity is to give a true and fair view of the position of the company <e> <s> if the auditor has taken the view in one case that the historic cost method is the right method and in another case that it should be the current cost method that must be because of a fundamental difference between the situations of the two companies <e> <s> i would therefore answer my noble friend by saying that if he finds that two companies are having their accounts presented under the accounting standard on these two different bases he should look further to ascertain what are the differences between the companies because they must be very relevant from an investors point of view which leads the companies and the auditors to take the view that they should be distinguished in that way <e> <s> it suggests that merely to look at companies accounts presented on the same basis does not necessarily tell one the whole story there is something a good deal deeper that one should look into if one is contemplating investing in two such companies and one is trying to compare them <e>", "<cs> that is the whole purpose <e>", "<cs> we appreciate the assistance offered here but the point is a slightly difficult one <e> <s> the phrase purchase price or production cost is a phrase which is not easily applicable to a number of different types of asset but we believe that accountancy practice can deal with these matters and that the phrase purchase price or production cost is sufficiently general to enable an accountant to make the proper application of it to a variety of different assets <e> <s> we feel that to provide a specific definition of this kind in the case of debts without doing it for all other assets where there might be difficulty might not be particularly helpful and it is for that reason that so far we have not been persuaded that this suggestion which i quite accept is made in the most helpful way would in fact be an improvement <e>", "<cs> it is perhaps not great gratitude to leave the noble lord melancholy but i will have to do that <e> <s> the purpose of this particular set of provisions is to lay out the possibilities and lifo last in first out is one of the possibilities <e> <s> the noble lord read from <e>", "<cs> the intention of this provision is to deal with the way in which the amount is treated for tax purposes <e> <s> it is not intended to raise the question of the returns made by the company to the inland revenue but to the treatment adopted in the companys accounts <e> <s> the point so far as the directive appears to bring it out relates to the actual sums that go into the reserve rather than the treatment of the taxation <e> <s> it may be that there is some difficulty between us on the way in which this is phrased <e> <s> i should be glad if the noble lord would accept an assurance that we shall look at this <e> <s> at the moment it seems to us that we have it correct and that the provision as drafted is in accordance with the directive and does not have the detrimental effect to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord will agree that we shall need time to consider that question <e>", "<cs> we will certainly look at what the noble lord has said <e> <s> of course the definition in paragraph was not primarily designed for oral recitation and therefore it may not be particularly adapted for that purpose <e> <s> nevertheless i think it is reasonably plain so far <e> <s> but we will certainly look at what the noble lord says to see whether we can improve it even further <e>", "<cs> unless i have misunderstood this or is left out for the purpose of the following amendment <e> <s> it is uncontroversial only if the following amendment is accepted <e>", "<cs> as has been pointed out amendment no <e> <s> is really a paving amendment for amendment no <e> <s> which is the amendment of substance and the purpose of this amendment is to render ineligible a group which contains an overseas bank <e> <s> the policy of this part of the provisions is to render ineligible groups or indeed companies which carry on banking business in this country <e> <s> that is the purpose of this provision <e> <s> perhaps there may be some misunderstanding about this <e> <s> the reference to an overseas bank would not of course have the effect of making the company ineligible unless it carries on business in this country and overseas banks which carry on business here but having their principal offices elsewhere will of course require an authorisation under the banking act and therefore be ineligible <e> <s> therefore this amendment would seek to extend that <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has explained his intention is to disallow the exemption on companies covered by this clause whereby they need not disclose in the information that they file with the registrar the aggregate amount of the directors emoluments <e> <s> that does not mean that they are not obliged to disclose it it just means that they are not obliged to disclose it in the accounts filed with the registrar <e> <s> they continue to have the obligation to disclose it to their shareholders but in our view companies covered by this provision are sufficiently small and sufficiently personal in character to be entitled to this exemption so far as the other people are concerned <e>", "<cs> i would certainly support the sentiments that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has expressed in relation to relieving the burden on small companies as much as possible <e> <s> that is a fair part of the object of what we are doing here and it is unfortunate in a way that acts of parliament are required in order to do that <e> <s> one cannot achieve that in this area without an act of parliament <e> <s> i also should like to express my appreciation of what the noble baroness lady phillips said on that subject <e> <s> it is an unfortunate corollary that one has to do it in this particular way <e>", "<cs> as has been explained by the noble lord the amendment would remove the exemption given whereby a medium-sized company need not file with the registrar particulars of its turnover as required to be given by paragraph of schedule in its accounts drawn up for shareholders <e> <s> i should have thought that this amendment displays a somewhat grudging attitude to the medium-sized company <e>", "<cs> the articles are article and of the directive on page <e> <s> the criteria of course have to be translated into sterling from the european units of account <e>", "<cs> it is perhaps not in order out if i can be out of order only very briefly the answer is that the obligations cast on small companies may be relieved to a certain extent and the extent that the noble lord was asking for in his amendment no <e> <s> goes beyond what the directive allows <e> <s> article i think is the relevant one <e>", "<cs> article is perhaps the best reference i can give <e> <s> perhaps i can guide the noble lord more fully outside the chamber if necessary <e>", "<cs> i share that hope <e> <s> our belief is that we have reached the balance due in the light of the consultation and the interests of small companies as creditors in the affairs of others will be present in the minds of those representing small companies in the consultation <e> <s> we feel that the results in this clause are reasonably balanced taking into account the exemptions and giving effect as far as possible to the reliefs that small companies are entitled to under the directive <e> <s> accordingly we hope that in due course the clause will stand part of the bill <e> <s> we shall consider later any amendments that the noble lord might suggest <e>", "<cs> taking the exemptions we are talking about in these amendments the directive entitles one to go up to a certain limit and the government had to consider whether to go to the full extent of the limit or something less in the definition of those companies which would benefit as small and medium-sized companies <e> <s> that is the nature of the discretion which arises under the kind of exemptions that we talk of in clause <e>", "<cs> the noble lord sees difficulties in his amendment as it stands <e> <s> the government considered this question of the auditing of the accounts of small companies <e> <s> in the light of replies that we received on consultation we conclude that the interests of shareholders and creditors and these have been referred to required that we should ask that the small companies should continue to require to be audited <e> <s> i hope that is sufficient on the substance of the matter to enable the noble lord to withdraw <e>", "<cs> as has been explained these amendments seek to lower the thresholds in subsections and of clause under which companies may qualify on the basis of turnover balance-sheet total and the number of employees as small or medium sized <e> <s> they would reduce significantly the number of companies able to take advantage of the accounting exemptions applicable to such companies as listed in clause <e> <s> as i believe the government have demonstrated and the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran referred to the statements of my right honourable friend the prime minister earlier the government wish to assist the small and medium-sized company sector of our business community wherever it is possible and where it is reasonable to do so <e> <s> we regard small companies as vital to our future economic prosperity <e> <s> we have therefore set the threshold at virtually the maximum permitted by the fourth directive for the classification of small and medium-sized companies in order that the maximum number of companies may take advantage of the exemptions <e>", "<cs> i believe it is true as my noble friend lord mottistone has said that the best practices do this already <e> <s> the directive requires us to do it however and that is why it is in this bill <e>", "<cs> i well understand the fears that my noble friend has expressed in this connection <e> <s> i must say however that paragraph iii implements article <e>", "<cs> i think that if what the company does by contract can properly be described as its activities and i should think that in most cases it could then it would be covered but i would not expect this clause to require a company to specify the method by which it was carrying on its research and development <e> <s> it would only be an indication of the activities which is a vague enough phrase to enable sufficient compliance without giving very much away <e>", "<cs> i think that it was it was that kind of time <e>", "<cs> may i first take the point raised by the noble lord lord bruce <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether we have considered requiring further information of the kinds that he has described <e> <s> there are of course provisions under which certain other information can be asked for for example the employment protection law entitles the employees to ask for certain information <e> <s> but when it came to considering whether further burdens of information should be put upon companies in this bill in the light of the consultation which has been held we came to the view that it would not be appropriate in this <e>", "<cs> we have considered this and for the moment we think that what is already in the bill is preferable to inserting the word such <e> <s> the word the in subsection refers back to the word the in subsection and i have not been able to find any qualifying content for the word such so for the moment at least we prefer to leave the provision as it is <e> <s> as for the indent i agree that the noble lord has made a point that is worthy of consideration and we may be able to do something about that <e>", "<cs> so far we have not found it necessary to make the change but we will look at it in the light of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> it is of course true that the directors have a responsibility for the directors report <e> <s> but the directors have a responsibility for the accounts as well and that does not in any way dispose of the need to have them audited <e> <s> the idea of this provision is simply to enforce what is presently good practice namely for the auditor to make sure that the information given in the directors report is consistent with what the accounts say <e> <s> further this is an obligation under article of the fourth directive <e>", "<cs> the amendment that the noble lord has moved and the other amendments would have the effect of depriving the secretary of state of the power to take account of changes that may occur <e> <s> it has been recognised for at least years that in this area accountancy is an inexact and developing science or perhaps i should say art <e> <s> it is essential that it should be possible to alter the requirements of the acts to take account of developments in practice and changes in economic circumstances without always having recourse to primary legislation <e> <s> the much more prescriptive approach to the requirements which we have been obliged to adopt by the directive is bound to make this need greater in future <e> <s> the secretary of states existing powers under section as amended already take account of that need by enabling him to alter add to or reduce the disclosure required in the balance sheet profit and loss account group accounts and directors report <e>", "<cs> so far as the first paragraph of this amendment is concerned it is already covered by the new subsections and a <e> <s> so far as the second paragraph is concerned we are on to the auditing question which we discussed earlier and the governments view at present at least is that it would not be wise to relax these obligations <e> <s> that is the present situation with regard to these two paragraphs and i hope that in the light of that explanation my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> as i read the bill this power is not given because the government consider the obligation to have the accounts audited to be an important one and the decision has been taken as i explained earlier that we should leave this obligation <e> <s> therefore there is no power in the bill as at present drafted to enable this to be done by regulation <e> <s> our view is that primary legislation is more appropriate for this purpose <e>", "<cs> the intention of clause is to apply all the new accounting requirements to overseas companies within the structure provided for <e> <s> the purpose of the paragraph to which my noble friend objects is to parallel a similar order-making power given to the secretary of state in relation to the generality of companies <e> <s> so if one looks at the bill as a whole there is no kind of discrimination against overseas companies <e> <s> what there is is an application to overseas companies of the general rules that apply to others <e> <s> in relation to the others the secretary of <e>", "<cs> the problem in connection with this matter is that if one is to decide whether a company which is seeking to register a name is seeking a name which is so similar to a registered name as to be likely to cause confusion it involves a very considerable judgment on the circumstances <e> <s> it is reasonably easy to devise an administrative procedure for identifying identical names subject to the minor additions to these which are permitted under the bill <e> <s> that is something that an administrative office can do efficiently and one can be reasonably confident that the result sought has been achieved <e> <s> but when it comes to a matter of this sort which is suggested by the noble lord lord mishcon one is in a very different field <e> <s> there are many cases in the books dealing with this problem or a problem very similar to this in the field of passing-off and it is obvious that one has to make a pretty extensive consideration of all the circumstances before one decides whether or not the similarity is sufficiently close to cause confusion <e>", "<cs> i am reasonably well aware of the functions of the registrar of trademarks and patents but i regard the registrar of trademarks as discharging a judicial function when deciding between competing claimants about the question of whether the mark which it is sought to register is confusingly similar to another <e>", "<cs> there are two particular factors involved <e> <s> the amount of work which is presently put to the registrar of companies has increased a great deal in recent years and therefore the existing staff has had to cope with much more work than it had before <e> <s> secondly and with great respect i do not agree that the existing law has worked well in the sense that has been suggested because as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has said with all his experience at the trademark and patents bar and notwithstanding the present situation people try to go as near as they can to the names of existing companies <e>", "<cs> the particular power that we are discussing at the moment is the power of the secretary of state to give a direction <e> <s> we are not dealing with the time within which the direction must be complied with <e> <s> that unfortunately was misprinted <e> <s> we intend to leave that as it is and a later amendment will correct that as six weeks instead of six months <e> <s> that was a misprint <e> <s> but the power we are considering just now was deliberately altered from the present period to months for the purpose of giving added protection to companies on the register <e> <s> the reason for that is that if the company has been put on the register the circumstance will normally be brought to the attention of the secretary of state by the company that has been disadvantaged by the second registration <e> <s> it may be some time before they get round to noticing that a registration has been entered <e> <s> it may be a registration that has not been greatly publicised or the company is a small one in a different part of the country <e> <s> the company may not notice that its name has been copied by another and it is in order to give more time for that that this period has been extended <e> <s> practical experience has been that very often these applications from disadvantaged companies come in after the present period has expired <e> <s> it seems a beneficial change therefore in the sense for which the noble lord was arguing that this period should be somewhat extended <e>", "<cs> just before we leave this point perhaps i may mention that the word profession is i think used in the act without any further definition <e> <s> at least for purposes up till now it has not proved too difficult to deal with that aspect of the act although as your lordships know it raises many other difficulties <e>", "<cs> i think it might depend a little on the circumstances in which they proposed to carry on business <e> <s> so far as the present law and the register of business names is concerned they would be able to get it on that register <e> <s> whether they would be able to carry on business under that name for any length of time would depend a great deal on the nature of their business <e> <s> i am pretty certain that if it was anything remotely to do with business which ici conducted they would speedily be invited to discontinue with possibly one or two threats added about what would happen if they did not <e> <s> so far as clause is concerned it is not strictly speaking consequential on the amendment already dealt with <e> <s> it would certainly be useful from our point of view to know the view of the committee on this clause as it stands <e>", "<cs> the government have considered this matter again particularly in view of what my noble friend said on second reading and we have tried to see whether we could strike a better balance than we already have <e> <s> it is obvious that if the full details are to be included the total amount of literature which would go out would become a tremendous burden on such businesses <e> <s> if one looks at some suggestions for this sort of provision one can see that the proposal would go as wide as any promotional material <e> <s> our view at present is that the balance which has been struck in the bill is reasonable and that so long as these provisions are complied with that would be sufficient for the purposes of securing that reasonable information about the matter is giving to people who have an interest to know <e>", "<cs> as matters stand there might be some doubt whether order forms are covered in the bill as drafted and in view of what has been said we will consider the matter further between now and report <e>", "<cs> a great deal of support in principle for these interesting proposals has been manifested on all sides of the committee <e> <s> so far as her majestys government are concerned they are interested to promote enterprises of this kind and to make it reasonably easy for them to promote themselves and to be continued <e> <s> it is in that spirit that i approach the amendments which have been proposed by the noble lord lord seebohm <e> <s> the principles he has explained and the desires he seeks to achieve are ones which we would certainly seek to facilitate <e>", "<cs> i did not mean to imply that the publicity would necessarily be undertaken by the government although no doubt the government might be able to assist in one way or another in such publicity <e> <s> to frame an alternative to table a on the lines of these proposals might have the kind of difficulty i have mentioned <e> <s> it would tend to put the company in its present stage of development or in the formulation of its memorandum and articles in its present state of development into the statute and thus inhibit further development <e> <s> therefore while i can see that doing so would achieve a fair measure of <e>", "<cs> i can well understand that and i was just about to say that i can well understand that that sort of arrangement would be over and above the provisions of the memorandum and articles in other words it might well be a condition of part of the employees contract on taking up the employment that he should be entitled to become a member of the company <e> <s> perhaps it would be more appropriate to have a contractual arrangement of that sort rather than to incorporate it into the memorandum and articles and of course it does mean that this sort of proposal we are talking about would have flexibility to be used for example in a case where for some good reason the general co-operative arrangement to which the noble lord lord oram referred might not be appropriate <e> <s> apart altogether from the question of development forward of this project we would also say that in the interests of flexibility in the interests of trying to fit this kind of scheme into a number of different situations it is unwise to legislate about it in too much detail <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might be allowed to say that i greatly regret that the noble and learned lord should feel that <e> <s> that is certainly not the spirit in which we have approached this matter quite the reverse <e> <s> i would say particularly that the fairly elaborate amendments which we have brought forward to provide for the purchase by a company of its own shares are a very positive response to trying to push forward the kind of proposal which the noble lord lord seebohm has made <e> <s> far from trying to put obstacles in his way we have sought to deal with these obstacles to some extent <e> <s> i should perhaps correct one thing that i said earlier about section <e> <s> we have certainly made proposals in relation to section <e> <s> we are considering what could be done in relation to section <e>", "<cs> i am inclined to the view that actions speak loudly in this context and i would have said that in this field the government have shown <e>", "<cs> i did not examine the clauses in tremendous detail because i sensed that the committee had accepted the suggestion put forward by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i certainly am in a position to give to the committee views about the clauses in considerable detail if that is thought to be wise <e> <s> however i concluded rightly or wrongly that perhaps it was unnecessary at this stage to go into that kind of detail <e> <s> when i spoke earlier the kind of further discussions which i had in mind were discussions about whether we had to the extent necessary to allow the scheme to proceed in the general clauses met the points which the noble lord lord seebohm considers to be essential <e> <s> that is the sort of discussion which i had in mind for the reasons which i have explained <e> <s> i hope i have made it clear that it seems to us not to be right to go ahead along the lines of these particular clauses for the reasons which i have mentioned <e> <s> i submit that the correct and wise approach is to remove so far as possible the obstacles as general obstacles and to permit therefore development of this sort of idea without these obstacles <e>", "<cs> in that case i have not made my main proposition very clear <e> <s> the view which we take is that the sort of company which is proposed in these amendments is of a very specialised form and subject to the matters which i have mentioned could be created under the companies acts as they presently stand <e> <s> if therefore they are a good thing and your lordships have plenty of evidence that for some circumstances they are an extremely good thing then it is right that they should proceed <e> <s> but in order for that to happen there is no need to put them into the companies acts as a special model <e> <s> to select one possible model and to give it pre-eminence in the companies acts would be a mistake and possibly would inhibit the very development which your lordships are anxious to promote <e>", "<cs> the question of whether or not a share premium has arisen is a question of law to be determined in the light of the facts and i should have thought that the amendment was unnecessary <e> <s> the bill as it stands achieves its purpose and i would suggest that in the light of the ordinary principle of economy this amendment should not be agreed to <e>", "<cs> so far as the first point is concerned there has been extensive consultation with all the bodies mentioned in connection with the formulation of these clauses <e> <s> i am not saying that they have seen the precise detail of the clauses but there has been extensive consultation with them about what was proposed <e> <s> the object of subsection is to ensure that there is always some non-redeemable equity issued in the form of ordinary shares before this redeemable share is possible <e> <s> it is true that the equity can be small but it is still necessary to have that as a starting point for the company otherwise the position would be that a company would be able to redeem its whole capital and wipe itself out <e> <s> even a small rather insignificant share of the type the noble lord referred to would have that effect although the resulting company would be a modest one <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his remarks <e> <s> i sympathise with him in his journey <e> <s> i am in somewhat the same position myself but for me the journey will be first thing tomorrow morning <e>", "<cs> noble lords have opened up a wide range of matters <e> <s> may i answer by identifying what the government feel are the advantages that will result from the new clauses first of all so far as private companies are concerned <e> <s> it can often be very difficult to transfer shares at present with the result that shareholders can become locked in that is unable to sell their shares and recover their investment in a company <e> <s> it is considered that the availability of a power of the company itself to use its funds to purchase its own shares will in many cases afford companies the means of releasing such investments <e> <s> this will increase the attraction of investment in private companies from the point of view of the investor who will have greater assurance that he will be able to recover his investment <e> <s> also the power to purchase own shares should make entrepreneurs and family companies less reluctant to accept participation of outside capital as equity capital as they will have the assurance that there need be no long-term dilution of control <e>", "<cs> so far as this matter is concerned the intention is to provide that the failure on the part of a company to redeem shares that is to let the shareholder out in accordance with the terms on which they were issued is to be treated as a breach of contract <e> <s> in other words the shareholder and the company will be treated as if they had a contract in these terms and the ordinary remedies will apply <e> <s> if i am not mistaken and if i am i shall be corrected the situation is that a shareholder under the present law may have an action in respect of breach of contract where that contract is with the company and is not simply a matter of the arrangements that are contained in the memorandum and articles <e> <s> therefore i do not at the moment see that the problems that the noble lord has suggested will flow from this will actually do so <e> <s> however i shall be happy to consider the matter further though that is the view i have formed in listening to him now <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly consider what we may be able to do in that particular respect and i am happy to consider further the suggestions made by the noble lord lord wedderburn <e>", "<cs> we will certainly do our best to bring forward at the earliest possible moment a solution to the problem <e> <s> it is not just a question of tomorrow dear as that may be to the hearts of some scotsmen <e> <s> so far as we are concerned the situation is that we are undertaking extensive and fairly precise consultations with these bodies at the moment and the difficulties to which for example the noble lord lord wedderburn drew attention are substantial difficulties which could have an effect on the structure of our financial institutions and companies for the future <e> <s> so i hope that the noble earl lord selkirk will feel that we are not just waiting for tomorrow to solve the problem we are in fact doing our best to achieve a solution which will be satisfactory to all parties and we hope to complete that within a reasonably short time <e>", "<cs> so far as the first point is concerned i accept of course that at the margin it is sometimes difficult to tell when you have finished with a contract of service and entered into the area of a contract for services <e> <s> where there is difficulty of that sort and it is in a comparatively small proportion of the total number of cases to which these provisions would apply it seems fair to conclude that the company would be prudent to disclose such a contract in both ways that is to say the way appropriate for a contract for service which is in effect a disclosure to the shareholders of the company and in the way appropriate to a contract for services which is part of the accounts <e> <s> we believe that this general distinction is sufficiently important to merit maintaining the separate treatment of the two types of contract in view of the desirability of preserving the details of a directors contract for service from the inquisitiveness of others while preserving those details for the shareholders themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for the constructive way in which he approaches this particular problem and i am grateful also to my noble friends who have displayed an interest in it <e> <s> as the noble lord has said it is a complex matter and it is not easy to be sure that one has it correct <e> <s> but the governments intention and there is not much doubt about this from what the noble lord lord bruce said is that we should try to get a concept here which is in accordance with the understanding of the professions so as to introduce reasonable flexibility into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that it is entirely my fault but the basic requirement which this paragraph is trying to mirror in our legislation arises from the provision in the directive <e> <s> the translation that has been adapted there is the word made which is why i think on the last occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords before i speak to the detail of this amendment i should like to take up a quotation from what i said on committee to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> the context has to be brought into mind because i agree with him generally speaking that there is available to an accountant a discretion as to which particular form of accounts he should adopt and that it by no means follows that a true and fair view could only be given in relation to a particular company by one method of laying out these accounts <e> <s> on the other hand as i think i made reasonably plain in the passage which followed that to which the noble lord drew attention the purpose of developing accounting standards in this area is to give uniformity so far as the primary set of accounts is concerned <e> <s> i should have thought that ssap was very relevant to that particular development <e>", "<cs> as i said my lords standard accounting practice will require substantially that information to be given in the cases to which it applies and our view is that it is not necessary to achieve the sort of good result the noble lord mentioned for it to be imposed as a statutory burden <e>", "<cs> my lords we have as i undertook on the last occasion looked at this again <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would be kind enough to look in the green paper at page the passage i have in mind is in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would remove a significant part of the exemption given to small companies in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords once again this amendment relates to what statutory burden should be placed upon small companies <e> <s> in our view and in the light of the consultation undertaken in connection with the implementation of the directive it is true to say that in a small company the emoluments of the directors are both very personal and of real competitive interest <e> <s> as allowed by the directive we believe that small companies i must stress that here we are dealing with small companies only should be able not to place information of this nature on the public file <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has underlined the policy of her majestys government in the assisting of small companies and we were grateful for his support in relation to the exemptions that we have been able to give which were attacked under the preceding amendments <e> <s> however i have to say that in relation to the present amendment so far as the filing of accounts is concerned we have gone as far as we are permitted to go by the fourth directive <e> <s> therefore i think i should take a minute to deal with the point about that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is article and it is the list of the matters to which the registration has to apply <e> <s> the noble lord will see a list which tells us that the directive is to apply to the following types of companies <e> <s> articles and provide the basis for exemptions and what we have done is to use articles and to the full <e> <s> the first is for what we have called small companies and the second for medium-sized companies <e> <s> as i understand the position we have taken as full account as we can of the exemptions which these provisions give us in relation to the filing of accounts <e> <s> the desire to keep this matter flexible is of course covered by the powers conferred upon the secretary of state in clauses and of the bill in relation to modification of the requirements to which the first part of the bill applies <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships as i said the situation of such businesses is always very much in our minds <e> <s> indeed i think i could say that it is the subject of almost constant consideration <e> <s> the difficulty in saying anything very positive with regard to this matter before third reading is that the directive places obligations upon us and it is unlikely that at a time like that we should be able to bring forward the consultation on the green paper but certainly we will consider what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the unworldliness of the chancery division <e> <s> the present proposals of the government are first to give a retrospective amnesty so far as past mergers are concerned that is clause but also to provide for the future specific exemptions on the lines of those which commended themselves to the jenkins committee <e> <s> we believe there is a minimum of consensus for exemptions going that far so the answer to my noble friends question is that we are not leaving <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole purpose of encouraging this initiative is in the hope that we could give effect to an agreed solution <e> <s> i know the lawyers are very forward in these consultations and i hope the others involved will be equally quick because obviously the sooner an agreed solution comes forward the easier it will be to incorporate it in the bill during its passage through another place <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the situation at the moment we are dealing with amendment no <e> <s> and whether it should be incorporated in what we are proposing in our amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if i may deal first of all with the question raised by the noble lord lord obrien of lothbury i said that this clause that the government proposed had resulted from consultations <e> <s> i am not of course claiming that the government have been able to please everyone whom they consulted but they feel that they have gone as far as it is reasonable to go to meet these in the light of the consultations so far <e> <s> but we are open to consider further the points which have been raised this afternoon <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is putting the matter reasonably i would say <e> <s> that is to say on a true construction of the instrument of resolution this particular exercise is a proper exercise of the power contained in that instrument or resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always possible to consider that ones own formulation is better than that of another <e> <s> so far as i am concerned at the moment i prefer the formulation of parliamentary counsel to any that i might attempt myself and with all respect to the suggestion made by the noble lord i also hold that view so far as his proposal is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that it afforded complete protection but that i thought it afforded the protection that is desirable <e> <s> in other words if a bank could show that it had investigated the matter to the extent of requiring a statutory declaration from the borrower and had no reason to doubt the accuracy of that then it would be protected <e> <s> if on the other hand one is thinking of a situation where all the pointers are against the transaction and all tend to suggest that the transaction is a bad one but all the bank has to do is to hold it up and say we have a statutory declaration we are all right <e> <s> it does not matter how many doubts there may be this statutory declaration which we have is the answer to them all we say that that goes too far and we have concluded that our amendment goes far enough to deal with that or with any reasonable requirement that a lending institution might have <e> <s> so far as <e>", "<cs> my lords i would refer the noble lord to subsection of the new clause which provides <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have said already that this is a rather difficult area and we are certainly not closing our minds to any progress we can make in improving this matter further <e> <s> if that is the undertaking that my noble friend has in mind then of course i am very content to give it <e> <s> we are very open-minded on this matter and anything that we see as a reasonable improvement on what we have done we shall be very glad to consider for incorporation <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords the openness of our minds is not directed in any particular way <e> <s> it is a very general kind of openness <e> <s> however i have to say to the noble lord that before putting down this form of the amendment we considered fairly carefully the broad choices that were open to us and the list idea which i think is what the noble lord has in mind did not commend itself to us as being particularly satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord grey has done a service to the house in speaking to an amendment which draws attention to an important aspect of a companys power to issue and redeem redeemable shares <e> <s> the purpose of his amendment is to prevent a company from being able to give deliberately preferential treatment to particular holders of redeemable shares <e> <s> this is an objective with which the government have every sympathy <e> <s> however we doubt that this is a matter which need be dealt with in statute <e>", "<cs> my lords the questions raised by this amendment i regret to say are fairly complicated and the explanation will take me some little time because we have had to examine the matter in some detail <e> <s> in prescribing authorisation procedures for a purchase by a company of its own shares we have distinguished an off-market purchase from a market purchase <e> <s> for this purpose a market purchase is confined to one effected through the listed or unlisted securities markets of the stock exchange <e> <s> our distinguishing transactions in this way is primarily determined by a practical consideration that it is impracticable for the precise terms of a deal effected through these markets to be determined in advance of the time at which the deal must be concluded <e> <s> in other words it is not possible to deal on the listed or unlisted securities markets on a conditional basis <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of whether or not the provisions for purchase of own shares should allow for shares in treasury is a matter that was discussed in connection with the job ownership companies and i think we were able to satisfy the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran at the meeting that we had with him and with the noble lord lord seebohm that that was an unnecessary complication in the bill and that so far as job ownership companies were concerned he would be able to achieve his objectives by using our procedures without that additional complication <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has raised a question which is particularly dear to my heart because the case on which he is founding was one in which i appeared as junior counsel for mr kaye who managed triumphantly to defeat the lord advocate of that time <e> <s> however the point in that case was whether an undischarged bankrupt in england that is a person who was made bankrupt in england and remained undischarged on coming to scotland was breaching a provision of the scottish bankruptcy act by obtaining credit in scotland <e> <s> after careful consideration as my noble friend said the high court of judiciary which is the supreme court of criminal appeal in these matters in scotland decided that he was not <e> <s> but that case arose on a consideration of the scottish bankruptcy act and did not arise on a consideration of the companies act and i believe that cogent as the argument for mr kaye was in the context of the act it would not have run on the act <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously we had in mind the duration of the strike and we have it continually in mind <e> <s> we also had in mind that there were previous occurrences and we regret the fact that in some respects the situation is worse than on some previous occasions although in other respects it is better than on previous occasions <e> <s> it is not quite right to say that the wheels of justice are at a complete standstill in glasgow and edinburgh <e> <s> so far quite an amount of work has been done in the sheriff court both in edinburgh and glasgow although certainly not nearly so much as is usually done <e> <s> we also have in mind what took place on the last occasion in the way of emergency powers legislation <e> <s> we are keeping that possibility under review <e> <s> however as the noble and learned lord is well aware the emergency powers legislation has no effect on getting people back to work and it is to that primarily that the efforts of the government are directed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can claim that i yield to no one in respect for the scottish legal system and its distinctive principles <e> <s> there is no question of this amendment having been drafted to bring scotlands law into line with the law in england and wales <e> <s> the present position is that no part of this bill is the law of england and wales nor of scotland <e> <s> the suggestion that the bill might go ahead so far as england and wales are concerned and then the matter should be considered whether it should be applied to scotland would i should have thought lead to exactly the situation that is being described scotland being treated as an appendage of england and wales which should follow in the light of what happens here <e> <s> surely it is right that in considering whether you should have this bill at all your lordships should consider whether it should apply to scotland as well as to england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is that on the prohibited degrees arising from affinity the law of scotland and the law of england and wales are at present the same <e> <s> there is only a very marginal difference between the law of scotland and the law of england and wales on the prohibited degrees altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to make it as clear as i can that i am not supporting anything about this bill at all but am pointing out what <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged <e> <s> i have taken it that these interventions were intended as questions and have tried to treat them accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords some questions are longer than others but it does not make them any less questions <e> <s> so far as haste is concerned may i say that when the principle of the bill was approved by your lordships on second reading the scottish office and the secretary of state for scotland thought it right to take some action <e> <s> the bill is not in our control <e> <s> i have said more than once and i say it again that it is the noble baronesss bill and here we are at the report stage <e> <s> we thought these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords if i might answer that question certainly i was well aware that my noble friend lord belstead drew to your lordships attention on second reading the question with regard to the effect of this bill as distinguishing the position in scotland from that in england and wales <e> <s> these amendments as i think is clear from what has gone before have certainly focused attention on this point in a way in which my noble friends speech on second reading with all respect to him does not appear to have done because the addresses by my noble friends on the matter have been fuller perhaps on this occasion than they were at second reading <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> i do not have the information and i think that my noble friend also does not have it at hand <e> <s> i think it may have been anticipated that because of the right reverend prelates position in this house differing from the position of the moderator of the church of scotland the right reverend prelates would know about the bill without the necessity of the home office communicating <e> <s> but that might not be the explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly try to respond to that invitation <e> <s> the situation is that under scottish law sexual intercourse between certain people related by affinity for example stepparents and their stepchildren is within the crime of incest <e> <s> yet people of that category will be permitted to marry provided they are at least if this bill is approved with the provisions that have already been discussed <e> <s> while it is unlikely that a court would hold that anyone who marries in pursuance of the bill would be guilty of incest in consummating the <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the position the bill as amended allows people in the particular relationship with which the bill deals to marry provided that they have attained the age of that is to say if they are years or over <e> <s> the provision with regard to incest just mirrors that and says that they are permitted if you like to have sexual intercourse without being guilty of incest if they are within these degrees but are or over <e> <s> so it is a mirror image of the provision with regard to the power to marry <e>", "<cs> my lords yes for these people so far as it would be incest now because under the age of they are not empowered by the bill to marry <e>", "<cs> my lords they are not empowered by the bill to marry and as regards scotland it would be incest and therefore the provision of the bill requires to deal with it in that sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank my noble friend lord noel-buxton for bringing forward these amendments and for the great courtesy he afforded me in giving very considerable notice of them some time ago so that we have had a considerable opportunity to think them over <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the congratulations which have already been expressed in what i might call the assembly of this team my noble friend lord selkirk the noble lord lord seebohm and the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton <e> <s> i think we are all agreed about the importance of this subject <e> <s> certainly i have always taken the view that it was an important matter and a matter which the government wish to take the earliest possible opportunity to deal with <e>", "<cs> my lords the object of putting this clause forward at the report stage in this house was so that the matter would be dealt with satisfactorily in the course of this legislation <e> <s> therefore the consultations will certainly be concluded in the course of the completion of this legislation through its stages in the other place hopefully we will complete our consideration of this bill this afternoon <e> <s> so that the time limit is as it were the preparation of this legislation and consideration of it now in the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i have tried in my general consideration of this matter to take account of a to which the noble lord is now referring <e> <s> my difficulty is to see how one could form any reasonable view <e> <s> let us say the situation was the payment of a dividend by a company with a very large number of shareholders <e> <s> if i am concerned in that transaction in some way how have i got the remotest basis for finding out whether a shareholder who is going to receive the dividend may use it to purchase shares in the company <e> <s> i quite understand that subsection a is intended to deal with this point but my great difficulty is understanding how it does so <e> <s> i should certainly be glad to hear an explanation from anyone who wishes to offer it as to how this is supposed to work <e> <s> that is a very fundamental matter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer that question <e> <s> i should not like to have my remarks characterised as castigation i certainly did not intend them to be construed in that light not at all <e> <s> i intended them simply to indicate difficulties that had occurred to me in a fairly preliminary consideration of the amendment <e> <s> i am certainly glad to hear some of the explanations that the noble lord lord wedderburn has given <e> <s> so far they have not entirely satisfied me that i was completely wrong <e> <s> for example i do not think he has explained why it is so liable indeed his explanation would seem to be that it was not so liable but liable in some other way but that is by the way <e> <s> i certainly did not want to give any impression that i was treating these amendments in any way that could be appropriately described as castigation <e> <s> i should perhaps also point out that in default in subsection is in relation to criminal liabilty <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a little difficult to give an absolutely unqualified undertaking but it certainly seems to me to be in the highest degree likely that we shall have to amend this clause <e> <s> i do not wish the house to think that i can say in what directions exactly or to what extent exactly the clause will be amended but i certainly believe that the clause will be amended <e> <s> i think i can undertake that the government will propose an amendment to this clause in the other place <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord bellwin is going to deal with this amendment in accordance with the allotment we arranged before but i cannot allow what the noble lord lord mishcon has said to pass without some comment <e> <s> what i was talking about on the last occasion was the question of whether a residue of points should be held over for the totting up business <e> <s> the subsection to which the noble lord referred deals with the question of whether at a certain stage one is bound to disqualify <e> <s> my argument dealt with a situation in which the court having disqualified felt they should wipe the slate clean <e> <s> of course in connection with the amount of disqualification the length and period of disqualification the matter is different <e> <s> subsection relates to the obligation on the court to order disqualification unless a very limited exception is made out compulsorily once the points have been reached <e>", "<cs> in anticipation of that brilliant prospect may i point out that the noble lord is treating subsection as if it covers the whole scope of what is open to the court to do once the points have been arrived at <e> <s> what subsection does is to limit the grounds on which the court could disqualify for less than the minimum period or not at all <e> <s> what i am pointing out is that if the total number of points is more than that might well be a ground for making the disqualification more than the minimum and that is the issue about carry-over as i see it <e> <s> i do not know whether i am going to see the white or not <e>", "<cs> i had understood the noble lord lord mishcon earlier to advise us that it was dangerous to legislate for special cases but his argument on this occasion rather suggests to me that it is based on rather special cases <e> <s> certainly so far as the first one is concerned i think i am right in saying that the section as he read it out has been modified by the criminal law act so that the section now reads <e>", "<cs> the intention in using the word exceptional is that it would require of the court that they should be satisfied that there had been some hardship quite out of the ordinary quite different from what one would get in any ordinary case because in almost every case a disqualification will give rise to hardship <e> <s> what the court has to look at is something which could be regarded as exceptional that is to say not to be expected in any ordinary case <e> <s> i think the word is a word of common usage and therefore a word which the court would be able to apply wisely to particular cases <e>", "<cs> the answer to the question would have to be for the court in a particular case but one has to have in mind that the driver of a heavy goods vehicle is driving a piece of equipment which can be a very serious danger to other people <e> <s> personally i would doubt whether merely to be able to say that one would put ones employment at risk by a disqualification would be an exceptional hardship because there are many in that situation <e> <s> for example <e>", "<cs> with regard to the first point of concern to which the noble baroness lady stedman drew attention the argument is that the difficulties facing the courts are difficulties we should try to meet at the earliest opportunity as my right honourable friend has indicated in the other place and also in his foreword to the report from the working party and the points system which is delivered in association with clause is a very considerable step forward in that direction and will also he extremely helpful if we are able to go further towards the fixed penalty system as we intend to do <e> <s> this is a step in the right direction and we hope the second step will come fairly quickly <e>", "<cs> it is difficult to attain perfection in this particular area without an undue amount of retrospection <e> <s> at the time of a previous endorsement it would count as one endorsement towards three which would introduce the disqualification period <e> <s> it was on that basis that we considered that three would be a reasonable number of points for all pre-existing endorsements bringing them into the new system on that basis <e> <s> i agree it means that some win but the only alternative would be to re-examine all the previous cases and that seemed to be a very large practical obstacle <e>", "<cs> if i may deal first with that point it is certainly for the prosecution to decide what charges will be preferred <e> <s> sometimes in relation to a traffic case there are charges of careless driving and reckless driving in the alternative passing the responsibility to the court to choose between the two degrees <e> <s> so far as scotland is concerned it is the responsibility of the crown to decide what form the prosecution shall take <e> <s> but the important point is that parliament has differentiated between the two <e> <s> there are distinct charges of reckless driving on the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take a lesson from my noble friends suggestion go on doing what you are doing now which is not to have a discretion in this particular matter but to have a fixed value for the purposes of totting up for this particular offence <e> <s> i should like to remind your lordships that of course there is the possibility of there being no endorsement at all <e> <s> if the offence is of such a character that the court considers that there are special reasons for not endorsing then the points value is zero <e> <s> so in a sense the discretion exists to have zero <e> <s> but if one comes to the situation where there is a definite offence of careless driving then what we have to say is that it is really unreasonable in the present state of the resources which are available to the court to make this discretion available for the first time because that is what is being proposed <e>", "<cs> the amendment opens the question of the range of points once one has decided that there should be a range and we are in principle agreed that there should be a range of points for these particular offences for the reasons which i mentioned earlier <e> <s> the general situation is that in our view to go below what we have already suggested is really introducing into the system an unrealistic degree of precision because one must have in mind that the law will have to be operated in a very large number of courts by a number of different magistrates even in the same court and so on <e> <s> at the low end of the scale one must also take account of the fact in many cases where the police are involved they give warnings rather than go forward to a prosecution <e> <s> the same is true in scotland <e> <s> perhaps i might risk touching on an offence which we were told about earlier this afternoon because i would think that a warning might be the appropriate way of dealing with that offence <e>", "<cs> i do not have the provision in front of me at this minute but my recollection of section of the road traffic act is that it includes an accident which causes damage to another vehicle and an obligation to report arises in that situation <e>", "<cs> as i said the obligation to report an accident to the police arises if the person has not stopped after the accident the accident being of the type that i have described and given his name and address and those of the owner of the vehicle to anyone having reasonable grounds for requiring them <e> <s> therefore if he has stopped and given particulars to someone who has reasonable grounds to require them in that situation the obligation to report to the police does not arise <e>", "<cs> i am not in a position to explain the policy that gave rise to section of the act and in the absence of a proposal to change it at the moment i am not sure that i can give a very good answer to that question but i shall certainly undertake to examine the question <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier the range that one takes for this is a matter of judgment <e> <s> in our view having regard to the nature of the penalties imposed the difficulties which i mentioned and the increase in the number of these offences this is a reasonable balance to take <e> <s> of course for a person who has very limited resources to find that the car he has cherished and kept polished and so on has been damaged in a parking place by someone who has not troubled to leave his name or any way in which he can be contacted is often rather an annoying experience <e> <s> if one is to judge all the possible refinements one could see the magistrates courts being taken up with this for rather a long time <e> <s> certainly we think that we have the balance about right <e>", "<cs> that depends on where the parking place is <e> <s> one can envisage parking places to which the law might not apply but in our view the provision which we have made here is perfectly reasonable <e> <s> we think that to go under five would be to introduce an unreasonable appearance of precision without actually attaining anything definite in exchange for it <e>", "<cs> the general approach to fixing the points value in this part of schedule has been to determine it by reference to the average <e>", "<cs> this particular offence has had the level of points attached to it in the same way as i sought to describe earlier for other offences in the schedule <e> <s> that is to say the level of points has been decided broadly by taking the average penalty that has been imposed by magistrates for the offence and that has included the experience referred to by my noble friend lady trumpington and by taking the average as a proportion of the fine imposed in cases of mandatory disqualification <e> <s> so it is an attempt to use the experience of magistrates of offences of this kind in order to give us a level <e>", "<cs> i have already said that we would consider this matter <e> <s> i am sorry that i did not answer the earlier question of my noble friend lady trumpington <e> <s> i had intended to do so but it slipped <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to delay the committee <e> <s> i was not suggesting that that was other than an answer to the question that i was asked by my noble friends <e> <s> i am not suggesting that that has much bearing one way or another on the correct number of points to assign in the schedule for this offence <e>", "<cs> this is the third time i have said this <e> <s> i said that i would be prepared to consider it <e>", "<cs> it is fairly obvious that parliament felt that speeding was a matter which constituted an offence by itself with variations which may make it more or less severe <e> <s> no doubt there are occasions on which one may speed in such a situation as to cause little difficulty <e> <s> if the particular speed limit is removed the following week that might seem to be one such situation <e> <s> we are obliged for that particular example <e> <s> but that does not show anything about the offence except that it is necessary for the speed limits to be kept realistic <e> <s> that was the lesson which my noble friend drew from his experience that it is necessary to keep the speed limits realistic <e> <s> i believe that considerable effort goes in that direction <e> <s> however that argument in a way would suggest that in some situations the offence should not be an offence at all <e> <s> magistrates have a discretion upon the penalty and in particular if there are special reasons they may decide not to endorse in which case there are no points awarded at all <e>", "<cs> that may well be but that is not a statutory consequence and equally if the penalty is a fixed one and if it is two points they will not learn anything more about the offence than that it was a speeding offence <e> <s> if parliament says that two points is attracted for a speeding offence the insurance company will learn nothing more once it learns that it is a speeding offence from the fact that two points have been awarded <e> <s> if they want to know anything about the seriousness of the offence in that situation they will look at the actual fine imposed so i stand by the view that there is no statutory consequence of this <e> <s> it is a warning and statutory deterrent against repetition but in my submission it does not even have much consequence for the insurance company because the nature of the offence itself will tell them as much they will learn nothing from looking at the points <e>", "<cs> probably it was not so obvious after all that a fixed penalty system is one with fixed penalties in it <e> <s> if you have a system where the penalty is going to vary with the courts discretion obviously the only way a person can get justice is to go to court <e> <s> the system which my noble friend has suggested just now is quite a considerable variation of what i would consider a fixed penalty system <e> <s> that would be one in which the penalty would be fixed and <e>", "<cs> i agree that that is a matter which takes some time and which can vary according to the circumstances but i do not agree that the remedy for that particular mischief is to affect the law about speeding offences in this particular way <e> <s> i should have thought that the remedy for that was to do ones best to ensure that the speed limits were properly reviewed <e>", "<cs> the distinction between the reference to scotland and the later references arises principally from the fact that the theft act is a measure covering england and wales and one that does not cover scotland <e> <s> the corresponding offence for scotland is contained in section of the act and it is slightly differently worded possibly because of differences between england and scotland in respect of the general law on theft <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to make a general pronouncement on that point but certainly my understanding of the provision is that before it was shown that one had allowed oneself to be carried in a motor vehicle that had been stolen circumstances would have to be shown from which it could be inferred that one had consented to be in that situation the one had consented to be in a stolen vehicle <e>", "<cs> that is correct <e> <s> the theft act does not apply to scotland <e>", "<cs> not in this form <e>", "<cs> the subject matter of these amendments is certainly among the most difficult of those that arise at least under this part of the bill <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady stedman has said from recent cases and particularly from <e>", "<cs> this is the reason why i wish to read the passage from the noble and learned lords speech <e> <s> he says this if i may just repeat it <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but in the very nature of things where this applies it would not result in any recorded conviction and obviously once the police understood the problem they would not take up such a case <e> <s> all i can say is that it is our impression that the total number of cases in which this point would arise would be not more than something of the order of or per cent <e> <s> and probably less <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter is one of judgment <e> <s> the government feel that the likelihood is that a young person who commits an offence in court under this clause will possibly be distressed and bewildered <e> <s> the best method of dealing with that it seems to us is by an immediate penalty such as the imposition of a fine <e> <s> an attendance centre order on the other hand is by its nature a delayed and protracted penalty which involves arranging for the juvenile to attend the centre for a few hours on alternate saturdays over a period of up to six months <e> <s> it seemed to the government that it was not wise to make that an appropriate punishment for contempt of court <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s>

bill as <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in connection with the provision in the bill whereby strict liability in

lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendments to <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said at committee stage we undertook to look at this matter and we have indeed done so very carefully <e> <s> i gave reasons at committee stage as to why we were opposed to the extension of discretionary points to offences other than failure to stop and failure to report <e> <s> of course i agree with my noble friend lord fortescue that we did accept that the circumstances of those offences were very special <e> <s> the offence is on the increase and it is a very important and dangerous trend in the traffic scene <e> <s> on the other hand i do not propose to go over again the arguments which i advanced at committee stage against the discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the noble lord lord underhill for his good wishes <e> <s> so far as accepting views is concerned i think i have shot my bolt in that respect <e> <s> not for the first time i am very grateful for the remarks which have been made by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby because in my submission to the house this proposal is indeed attempting to introduce very fastidious discretion into this matter <e> <s> there are some such cases every year and as one of the law officers who has a responsibility for the administration of justice i certainly cannot be indifferent to the proposal which would place considerable extra burdens on the courts at a time when there are already quite intolerable delays in dealing with very serious cases as anyone who has any connection with the administration of justice knows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am just coming to the question to the effect of this amendment on the fixed penalty system <e> <s> the arguments that i have already developed in my submission apply very strongly to the speeding case because of the great number of such cases but my noble friends intervention came at an appropriate time because i was just about to pass to the relationship of this proposal with the possible extension of the fixed penalty system to the less serious endorsable moving traffic offences <e> <s> when i raised this argument before i was accused i think of using it almost as a gamblers last desperate throw because i had not used it in relation to careless driving or insurance offences <e> <s> however the argument is not relevant to these offences because we are not proposing that the fixed penalty system should be extended to cover them <e> <s> it is relevant to speeding offences which we would like to see included in an extended fixed penalty system <e>", "<cs> my lords the other matter that i should mention is that if the offence is entirely technical and there are special reasons for non-endorsement of course the points do not arise at all so there is a discretion in the court in these circumstances to impose no points at all because it is only when the endorsement is put on that the points arise <e> <s> so there is an element of discretion already nothing or the fixed number that we suggest <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i understand the position the amendment set down in the name of the noble lord lord underhill goes further in permitting entry than the governments amendment on the question of entry into a persons house because lord underhills amendment would allow it in the case of any accident i think that was properly described as an accident at all whereas our amendment would restrict it to an accident <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord but my noble friend lord lucas was referring to lord underhills amendment and i just wanted to explain the relationship that our amendment requires based on the accident point that the accident should be one involving personal injury to another <e> <s> so far as the question of the noble lord lord monson is concerned in the sort of case to which he has referred i would think that there was very likely reasonable cause to suspect that the person driving the car was guilty of an offence under subsection and the first branch of our proposed amendment would apply to it <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be right for me to congratulate my noble friend on that particular achievement and i hope that the noble lord lord avebury will agree with us further as he listens to the persuasive arguments that are to be put forward <e> <s> it would be churlish now to turn down finally and out of hand proposals coming from such eminent quarters and certainly i shall be very glad to consider further what has been said to see whether we can improve the bill <e> <s> i must say that so far i have not been entirely persuaded that we shall achieve that objective easily but we shall certainly try <e>", "<cs> it may be right for me to say to the noble lord lord avebury that the mere fact that lawyers may take a different view about a certain matter does not necessarily mean that the matter is not reasonably clear <e> <s> may i deal with the point that my noble friend lord colville of culross raised <e> <s> he drew our attention to the provisions of clause and wished to comment on their relationship to the present clause <e> <s> if members of the committee would be kind enough to look at clause they will see <e>", "<cs> it is plain that this is a matter not so much of the intention but of how the intention is to be achieved <e> <s> i should be very happy indeed to reconsider the position in the light of what has been said in this debate because it is plain that we want to make it clear if we can <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for putting down this amendment and thus affording us an early opportunity in consideration of the amendments relating to clause to give fairly general consideration to the situation <e> <s> i should like to begin by seeking to describe the current arrangements for the transmission of citizenship because they appear to be both anomalous and confused <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord aylestone who moved this amendment has clearly indicated we have already discussed the ground to some extent <e> <s> the question of where one stops in the automatic conferment of citizenship by succession overseas is certainly a difficult one <e> <s> but the government have given very full consideration to it and i fear therefore that i am not in a position to give any undertaking that we will reconsider that in any meaningful sense <e>", "<cs> the noble lords amendment would certainly greatly extend the scope of clause <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble baroness that the harmony on that particular matter very strongly exists <e> <s> however the situation is that if for example a person is serving the european economic community his arrangements may well come under the provisions of clause and particularly arrangements of that kind would be referred to under clause <e>", "<cs> they are somewhat different from those in clause <e> <s> i would submit that the mere fact that registration is required does not necessarily make the arrangements inferior because once you have the certificate registration carries with it an entitlement which otherwise you have to wait to establish until a suitable requirement or need arises <e> <s> so the mere fact that it is subject to registration procedure does not seem to me to make the arrangement inferior <e>", "<cs> i am sure that it is the pleasure of lawyers to welcome into their arguments noble baronesses such as the noble baroness lady white <e> <s> i certainly agree that the nature of the legal relationships which membership of the european economic community imposes on the united kingdom may in important respects be different from the legal relationship which for example being a member of the united nations imposes on the united kingdom <e> <s> but i do not necessarily accept that these differences are important in the particular context which we are considering <e>", "<cs> i had finished most of what i was going to say on this aspect of the matter <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> there is an area to which clause applies which in a sense has to be vaguer than the situation to which clause applies <e> <s> the idea of clause is that it should apply to situations which are instantly verifiable as it were and surveys with the government and with for example the overseas civil service and by crown servants seconded to international organisations as part of their careers and the british council are of that character <e>", "<cs> the bill distinguishes between british citizens and british citizens other than by descent so the question which has just been posed by the noble lord lord spens does not really arise <e> <s> so long as one is a british citizen otherwise than by descent it does not matter by which particular route one has achieved that <e>", "<cs> the way that i see it is this <e> <s> the conditions in clause also have to be complied with and accordingly a person who has any occasion to show that he is a british citizen under clause will have to demonstrate that these facts obtain <e> <s> there is some advantage in a procedure for registration under which the facts which the person has to establish are established within a short time of the occurrence of the facts which are in question whereas under clause it might be some considerable time before that investigation started <e> <s> it is a small point but it does not seem to me to be necessarily inferior to have to go through a registration procedure <e>", "<cs> the situation as i understand it is this a british citizen otherwise than by descent automatically transmits that citizenship to a child born overseas <e> <s> if the parent is himself a british citizen by descent he does not automatically transmit british citizenship to his child <e> <s> before he can do so he has to establish some further connection between himself and the united kingdom <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> appropriate as that suggestion is i doubt whether it would go the whole distance <e> <s> the answer to the question which the right reverend prelate has raised must depend upon whether or not the missionary in question is employed by an association established in the united kingdom <e> <s> we understand that most of the arrangements under <e>", "<cs> in using the phrase the church i certainly had in mind a very wide conception <e> <s> certainly i was not excluding <e>", "<cs> i was hoping to be able to offer some such phrase <e> <s> i had in mind the circumstances of missionaires generally but in that connection one has to remember what my noble friend lord renton said <e>", "<cs> with regard to the last matter i am glad to know that the noble duke himself remains of the mind he expressed on the previous occasion and that he has been able to use this occasion to clarify the position between himself and his hierarchy <e> <s> so far as this amendment is concerned i might be pardoned for thinking that it was devised in order to produce the answer to both of the noble lords conundrums <e> <s> i think my answer on the basis of the present bill is that neither of the children to which he made reference would be united kingdom citizens unless there are any other facts involved which were not stated <e> <s> on the facts stated that is the position <e> <s> i was almost wishing myself back in private practice as i heard these examples in the hope that finding the answer might have produced some particular result for me <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble lord lord mishcon has said it is important to observe that the amendment of the noble lord lord avebury does not permit of any transmission beyond the second generation <e> <s> if you are to have transmission beyond the second generation then you have to bring in criteria by reference to which that is allowed and that will bring you into the same problem <e> <s> therefore unless this is the sole solution the simplicity which the noble lord lord avebury prays in aid for his amendment is not achieved <e> <s> accordingly in my submission what the noble lord lord mishcon says is no more true of what the noble lord lord avebury is proposing than it is true of what we are proposing where we stop generally at the first generation and have criteria thereafter <e> <s> if you stop at the second generation you require criteria thereafter just the same if you are going to allow it at all <e> <s> so the middle course which the noble lord has proposed is not open on the argument that the noble lord lord avebury has produced <e>", "<cs> the substantive amendment to which my noble friend has spoken is amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> perhaps i should first emphasise that the phrase relevant employment which is part of the conditions does not need to be employment overseas <e> <s> in order to make that plain because a question was raised in the other place about it there is an amendment down in the name of my noble friend lord belstead amendment no <e> <s> which adds in line whether or not in the united kingdom <e> <s> so provided the united kingdom employment was relevant employment the child that would get the benefit of clause can be born quite a short time after going overseas <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the two-year period is to ensure a reasonably substantial period of employment <e> <s> the point which i made earlier was that that employment can start in the united kingdom and be for practically all the time before the birth in the united kingdom <e> <s> but the idea is that you cannot just take up employment of a very short duration as it were for the purposes of obtaining citizenship for the child <e> <s> two years is a reasonable period to which the employment must conform if it is to be regarded as sufficiently substantial to give the necessary link <e> <s> that is the explanation <e> <s> the two-year period is as i have said subject to a discretion if the circumstances are sufficient to show that a shorter period was sufficiently substantial for the purpose <e>", "<cs> i think that it is quite plain that the governments desire is to have a sensible criterion for dealing with this question of employment <e> <s> this is why there is a special discretion in subsection <e>", "<cs> surely the best way to cover this situation is by discretion <e>", "<cs> i am greatly obliged to my noble friend for that remark <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones said earlier i had previously expressed myself as sympathetic to this matter and of course i remain of the same mind <e> <s> as has been said the context in which the phrase occurs here is slightly different from the context in which it occurred earlier and that point clearly calls for particular consideration as to the proper phrase to use here <e> <s> certainly our intention is that this should be an entitlement which should be subject to appeal to the court and that is the purpose of the clause <e> <s> the exact scope of the appeal will depend on the precise phrase chosen and we shall do our best to draw up a phrase that satisfies all members of your lordships committee <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this provision is to set out the links by which a citizen by descent can connect himself or herself sufficiently with the united kingdom to transmit that citizenship to his or her child <e> <s> in view of the fact that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has moved this amendment it might be right to remind the committee that when this matter was considered by the government of which he was a member and the green paper was issued for consultation the view that was taken by the then government was <e>", "<cs> i can see that being in the united kingdom whether as an employed or unemployed person is a kind of connection with the united kingdom <e> <s> that is well covered by the sort of discretion which the secretary of state has <e> <s> i was thinking of unemployment generally <e> <s> i cannot think how unemployment generally whether in the united kingdom or elsewhere can of itself be a connection with the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> i said earlier that it was our intention to listen carefully to all that has been said in debating this bill <e> <s> this is a difficult matter to cover adequately in every detail but we shall carefully consider what has been said on this subject and we will see whether there can be any flexibility for altering the rule <e> <s> i cannot say any more than that we shall consider the situation <e>", "<cs> the idea is that the interval is restricted to days for whatever reason <e> <s> that is the general rule <e> <s> again the matter is capable of being covered by discretion but that is certainly the intention of the principal provision <e>", "<cs> i certainly would not express surprise that the noble lord should make a sensible point not at all <e> <s> i think that these provisions are drafted against the background of what is understood to be the likely circumstances and the use of the words company and association arises for that reason <e> <s> but i certainly undertake to consider with my colleagues the problem that the noble lord has raised in order to see whether in fact there is anything that we ought to do in that connection <e>", "<cs> in this case there is no difference between us about the sense of the matter <e> <s> the subsection that we are considering lists a number of forms of employment which can be relevant employment and then the word or between the last two of these is an indication of the nature of the link which exists <e> <s> i think that it is in accordance with normal drafting style to express it in that way <e> <s> it would not be wrong to have or in at each of the preceding breaks but it would add nothing except an extra word and in the interests of economy and of elegance of style i think that it would be right to leave this subsection as it is <e> <s> in the light of that explanation i hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i suppose that computers will need to learn to cope with the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> as regards clause <e>", "<cs> this series of amendments are at the very least drafting amendments and they may as my noble friend said have some effect in substance <e> <s> it may be helpful if i read the subsection as i think it would be if my noble friends amendments were given effect to <e> <s> i think subsection would in that event read <e>", "<cs> so far as the first point is concerned the power we are looking at in subsection <e>", "<cs> again subject to the circumstances as a whole and it is a pure discretion it would be open to the secretary of state to consider making the two-year period so short that it would be the period after that awkward or day interval had occurred <e> <s> so if it was about the middle the period to which he would actually shorten it might be just under a year <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier it is obvious that this clause has to deal with a great variety of circumstances and if you deal with all the possible circumstances you will certainly sacrifice the clarity which the present clause has and the more special circumstances you deal with the more difficult the whole thing will become <e> <s> it is important to remember that there is an overriding and complete discretion to grant citizenship to a minor in clause and in my submission there is a limit to the number of subsidiary discretions that it is right to have and subsection <e>", "<cs> yes i agree with the noble lord lord gifford about that when one takes account of the effect of the later provision <e> <s> i was really attempting to distinguish between the kind of burden that ordinarily exists to overcome a discretion and the kind of burden on an applicant to show that he was entitled <e> <s> to distinguish between those two was what i had in mind and i hope i succeeded in doing so <e>", "<cs> as has already been pointed out the purpose of subsection is to provide a basis for deciding that a person born outside the united kingdom has a sufficient connection with the united kingdom to be entitled to citizenship <e> <s> the nature of the connection is three years residence in the united kingdom subject to qualifications with that persons family father and mother if they are both alive <e> <s> as my noble friend lord drumalbyn has so clearly pointed out the provision in subsection is designed to deal with the situation where the father or mother have died <e> <s> if both father and mother have died then this method of demonstrating connection is not open because in the nature of things the family sadly is not there to have such a connection <e>", "<cs> not even the secretary of state can foresee all possible cases and therefore there is some difficulty as my noble friend lord home of the hirsel said in laying down in a pamphlet how he proposes to exercise his discretion <e> <s> i agree that it might be useful sometimes to know how he had done it but unless one could have a full record of all the facts one would be in the same kind of difficulty as in trying to compare sentences imposed by different magistrates on different cases from newspaper reports where not all the facts are set out <e>", "<cs> the government of course very fully appreciate the importance of our membership of the european community and of the special ties which exist through our participation in european matters <e> <s> there will be logic in going from that to some aspects of citizenship <e> <s> but it remains the fact that the individual members of the community retain separate citizenships and that there is nothing in the circumstances of our membership to indicate that birth within the community should confer greater privileges as regards citizenship than birth outside it <e>", "<cs> as i said in answer to amendment no <e> <s> a which was moved by my noble friend lord drumalbyn the government are undertaking to bring forward amendments to deal with this point <e> <s> i hope that in a sense that will be satisfactory to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> the number of situations in which someone will come along seeking to have the test for naturalisation in scottish gaelic is probably likely to be rather small <e> <s> indeed i think that my noble friend lord campbell of croy did not suggest that there were many people who would pass the test in gaelic and would not be able to pass it in english <e> <s> notwith-standing that it is quite an important question whether scottish gaelic should be put into the bill at this stage and it is only for this purpose and i am particularly happy to be able to say that the government will very carefully consider whether the amendment or something similar to it should be added to the bill <e>", "<cs> i will do my best to repair that omission <e> <s> the situation at the present moment is that registration of british citizenship by consular means is available only in foreign countries that is non-commonwealth countries <e> <s> that arrangement does not apply within the commonwealth and there is no procedure within the commonwealth for extending the right of citizenship by descent in the way that one can do outside the commonwealth <e> <s> that it seems to me at least and to the government is an anomaly of the present situation <e> <s> there is no provision in the bill so far as i understand it which gives any effective registration powers so far as high commissioners are concerned <e> <s> they will of course be able to receive applications which are passed on to the home secretary but there is no registration by high commissions in the way that presently applies in consulates for consular registration <e> <s> therefore the difficulty if i may put it in that way which my noble friend lord renton raised does not apply <e> <s> clause is designed to continue only the present anomalous system of consular registration for a period of five years subject to the provisions of the bill but it does not have any other effect than that <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i gave the impression that the reason for cutting off consular registration was a mechanical reason <e> <s> i certainly did not have that in mind <e> <s> the general provisions of the bill are to this effect british citizens will be able automatically to pass on to their descendants to the first generation overseas british citizenship without any qualification <e> <s> where there is a question beyond the first generation it will be passed on only where there are genuine real links with this country <e> <s> clauses and of the bill are concerned with setting down the criteria by which these genuine links shall be determined <e>", "<cs> in a sense that is so because the consular registration as a way into citizenship will subject to the conditions of clause continue for five years as a transitional provision <e> <s> from then on consular registration as such will no longer be available and the consulates and high commissions in so far as they play any part at all in this will simply act as channels of communication <e>", "<cs> it is through the male line at the moment that consular registration is possible <e> <s> in other words it is a father who is a british citizen who is entitled to consular registration at the present time <e> <s> it does not depend on the sex of the child <e> <s> it is the male parent who transmits <e> <s> so far as the administrative arrangements are concerned the intention certainly is to make as smooth administrative arrangements as are possible to administer what we think is a rational system <e>", "<cs> i am almost encouraged to invite your lordships to guess what the rational system would be but i think it is reasonably obvious that it is by descent <e>", "<cs> i think that it would be convenient to take together as my noble friend has done all the amendments that he has mentioned because it is obvious that they are linked together <e> <s> as i sought to explain in answer to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter when he was moving the previous amendment the intention of this clause is to extend for a limited period the possibility of consular registration to those who were in a position to have reasonable expectations of it at the time this bill commences <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> i had sought to answer these questions perhaps by implication more than expressly <e> <s> it is certainly a necessary condition as our clause runs that at the time of commencement the <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord avebury has pointed out present nationality law does not allow automatic transmission of citizenship in the female line <e> <s> it is nevertheless true that many of those with mothers who are citizens of the united kingdom and colonies will already have been able to obtain our citizenship by registration <e> <s> minor children born overseas to women citizens born in the united kingdom are at present able to acquire citizenship of the united kingdom and colonies under the home secretarys discretion to register minor children under section of the british nationality act <e>", "<cs> i should like first of all to make what i think is an important preliminary point <e> <s> it has been mentioned already by the noble lord lord gifford in moving this amendment although i think with respect perhaps not quite accurately <e> <s> the only relevant difference between citizenship by descent and citizenship otherwise than by descent is in the transmission of citizenship to children born outside the united kingdom <e> <s> so far as children born inside the united kingdom are concerned there is no relevant difference whatsoever <e> <s> accordingly it is only when one is considering the situation of children born outside the united kingdom that this point arises <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady elles has once again eloquently demonstrated both her knowledge of this matter and her very good support for something being done for the people of whom she has spoken <e> <s> i think perhaps it is fair to say that this amendment might not carry with it all that she has been talking of as my noble friend lord drumalbyn has pointed out <e>", "<cs> the structure of the bill as it stands means that a british citizen is either a british citizen by descent or a british citizen otherwise than by descent <e> <s> in other words these two classes make up the whole class of british citizens and the classes are mutually exclusive <e> <s> as i have said before the distinction is however relevant in one context only <e> <s> a british citizen otherwise than by descent can transmit his citizenship to a child born overseas whereas a british citizen by descent cannot <e> <s> as i have already said it is only children born overseas who are affected <e> <s> a child born in this country to a british citizen would be a british citizen otherwise than by descent whether his parent was a british citizen otherwise than by descent or a citizen by descent <e>", "<cs> i am not absolutely clear about what method the noble lord is referring to for acquisition of citizenship because if it is not clause and i am assuming that from his example it must be i would think clause <e> <s> the necessary condition for clause is that the parents accompany the child assuming there are two parents and that is the situation the noble lord is contemplating <e> <s> so the clause provision appears to me to fit reasonably well with the present immigration rules and it cannot be too surprising if the noble lord is thinking of some different arrangement from the one in the bill and then finds that it does not fit with the present immigration rules which i think is the dilemma he is putting to me <e> <s> i am not sure that that is an entirely fair proposition because the only method of acquisition that i can see that would apply in the circumstances is the clause procedure <e>", "<cs> on the point raised by my noble friend lord drumalbyn far from having a fixation of the kind he describes i am saying that people in that category will have no disadvantage at all <e> <s> people who come back and stay on in this country will have no disadvantage at all because as i have sought to point out a british citizen by descent who then remains in this country and has children here will of course have children who will be british citizens otherwise than by descent <e> <s> so far as my noble friend lady elles is concerned i well appreciate the dream of scotland that so many of her family have <e> <s> i only hope that it will be fully realised <e>", "<cs> i am greatly obliged to my noble friend lord drumalbyn because it is obvious that debates on this schedule go back very much to the question of the earlier substantive provisions for the passing on of british citizenship <e> <s> so far as this particular proposal is concerned in our view it would not be appropriate to treat as my noble friend said in effect european community territories as if they were part of the united kingdom and its dependent territories for the purposes of this schedule <e>", "<cs> just as in the previous amendment those whom this amendment would seek to benefit would have only extremely tenuous links with this country were it not for the residence requirement <e> <s> in these circumstances we think it right that in order to establish some link with this country for the person to be entitled to its citizenship a modest residence requirement should be imposed as really the only practicable link that could be demonstrated <e> <s> it follows that in our view it would not be right to accede to this amendment which has the effect of eliminating this only possible remaining link <e> <s> in the light of this explanation i hope that the noble lord will feel able to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord gifford pointed out in moving this amendment a similar provision was in the british nationality act the clarity of which we have had so recently proclaimed to us <e> <s> it may be of some interest that since there have been cases of persons who have been deprived of citizenship of the united kingdom and colonies <e> <s> of these were deprived by the home secretary in the united kingdom and by the governor of a dependent territory <e> <s> my understanding is that the use of this power therefore is a very limited one <e> <s> it has been used in the past with the greatest discretion and it would be most unusual if any change occurred in that <e> <s> all that is happening is that substantially the same provisions are being re-enacted <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord gifford in moving his amendment has accurately described the situation and the effect of what is proposed in so far as he has been describing the bill itself <e> <s> perhaps i should emphasise at the outset that the bill does not interfere in any way with registration of those people who were registered before commencement of the bill as citizens of the united kingdom and colonies <e> <s> it applies only to registration in respect of the new system of citizenship that we are seeking to set up <e> <s> it certainly seems to us that it is right at this juncture to consider and provide for the situation which could arise <e>", "<cs> if one is taking the whole story into account one takes account in considering the right of registration of the possibility of deprivation <e> <s> in other words the provisions with regard to deprivation have to be looked at when one is considering what is the right that has been conferred <e> <s> i perfectly see the argument which the noble lord is putting forward but i would ask him to see equally the argument that where the power to deprive applies to naturalisation citizenship by grant of that kind it should equally <e>", "<cs> it might be of assistance if i begin by saying that of the cases of people deprived of citizenship in the united kingdom five have been referred to a committee of inquiry and in all cases the secretary of states decision was in accordance with the decision of the committee none of the cases arising in the dependencies were looked into by a committee of inquiry so we have no really relevant experience of a case in which the committee of inquiry and the secretary of state have come to different views <e> <s> therefore as the noble and learned lord said we should expect the secretary of state to go along with the view of the committee of inquiry and that in practice is what has happened <e> <s> in principle therefore one would expect the secretary of state to be very unlikely to dispute or depart from a recommendation of a committee of inquiry of this kind looking into his proposal <e> <s> however it is going a bit further to say that he should be bound <e> <s> for example new facts could emerge which might dispose the secretary of state to hold his hand despite his own original proposal <e> <s> he would be precluded from doing so by this amendment if the committee had recommended for deprivation <e> <s> so the noble and learned lords amendment would not necessarily tell in favour of the person <e>", "<cs> prager <e>", "<cs> if i may answer the noble and learned lords question as it is fresh in my mind i think the answer is that if the facts were in favour of the subject of the proceedings then the secretary of state might feel disposed contrary to the recommendation of the committee not to go ahead and if this amendment were passed in this form it would preclude that <e> <s> on the other hand i think it is fairly plain that if the committee were to be in favour of the subject and then some further facts were to emerge against the subject the secretary of state would not feel it right to proceed on that basis without submitting those facts to the committee to see whether the new facts changed the minds of the committee <e>", "<cs> in the government view a right of appeal in an area in which parliament is conferring an absolute discretion on the secretary of state is inappropriate <e> <s> in our view naturalisation should remain as it always has been a matter of discretion for the secretary of state <e> <s> in days long gone by it was a matter within the gift of the sovereign later powers to naturalise were exercised by parliament but for a long time indeed since powers in respect of naturalisation have been vested in the secretary of state as matters of absolute discretion <e>", "<cs> may i first of all make it clear that the undertakings which i gave earlier were to consider the expression that was used in the bill the secretary of state is satisfied with a view to seeing whether that expression caused an impediment to the achieving of the result which we said was achieved <e> <s> i have never said that we agree that it is necessary to bring any kind of appeal procedure into this bill for that particular matter <e> <s> what we have said is that we want to consider the words to make sure that a person has access to the court in order to vindicate his rights in the entitlement situation <e> <s> that seems to me to cover the right in a way more directly than an appeal <e> <s> the very idea of an appeal procedure may not be the best thought for this <e> <s> this is a situation in which a person has a right which in our view he should be entitled to vindicate <e> <s> that is the purpose that we have in mind and which i think would entirely match the object that my noble friend viscount colville had in mind <e>", "<cs> in my respectful submission it is not right to speak of subsection of clause as being in isolation or even in glorious isolation it is part of the whole provisions of the bill <e> <s> i am sure that the noble and learned lord who moved the amendment would accept that it is one of the fundamental principles of the construction of any act of parliament that it must be read as a whole and that therefore the court in reading subsection of this clause would read it in the light of all the provisions of the bill including subsection <e> <s> i think that that is abundantly established on the authorities in this branch of the law <e>", "<cs> my answer to that is that to some extent it must depend upon the circumstances <e> <s> but in an applicaton to the court to have the question determined i should expect it to be argued in court that the protection afforded by the latter part of clause cannot apply to prevent review where it is suggested that the discretion which has been exercised is not a discretion which the bill contemplates but something completely different <e> <s> there may be other ways in which a discretion could be vitiated by considerations of that kind apart from questions about discrimination under clause <e> <s> there may be inferences from other parts of the bill or from general principle that would have that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment which the noble lord has tabled is i think practically the same as an amendment for inclusion in clause which he tabled at the committee stage as he has said <e> <s> he pressed it to a division at that place and your lordships rejected the amendment <e> <s> it reappears now for insertion in a different clause <e> <s> it is quite clear i should have thought that if it has a place in the bill at all it is in the place where it was originally put and not in clause <e> <s> therefore far from advancing the cause of the amendment by putting it in the wrong place the argument for it has been somewhat downgraded <e>", "<cs> my lords the result of giving effect to the amendments that the noble lord has proposed is not by any means clear <e> <s> if one takes the amendments and applies them to the clause one finishes with something of this sort <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking those who have welcomed this amendment and having done that rather briefly go on to try to answer some of the questions that have been posed to me <e> <s> first so far as the question of community institution is concerned that is an expression which was defined originally in the european communities act and in the first schedule <e> <s> in order to set out that definition one has to begin with a definition of the communities and the communities as defined in that act means the european economic community the european coal and steel community and the european atomic energy community <e>", "<cs> my lords the government accept that certain employees of international organisations do have sufficiently close and continuing connections with this country to justify being able to benefit like those in crown service from the provisions of clause of the bill <e> <s> the bill now provides under the government amendment which your lordships have just seen fit to accept that employees of european community institutions should be covered by clause <e> <s> secondly as i explained on a previous occasion it is intended that crown servants who have been seconded to international organisations in the course of their careers should be included among those whose employment is designated under clause of the bill as service closely associated with the activities outside the united kingdom of her majestys government in the united kingdom <e> <s> those employees too will therefore be able to benefit from the provisions of clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the question does not depend so much upon the particular terms of employment as upon the nature of the connection between the person in question and the united kingdom <e> <s> in many cases of course the parents may come back to the united kingdom in which case the provisions of clause would be effective to produce british citizenship for their children <e> <s> if they have connections with this country by residence in it and our amendment no <e> <s> is accepted then equally they will have british citizenship by descent in the second generation <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is apparently designed to clarify one aspect of the definitions in clause which clause as your lordships know enables the secretary of state to designate by order made by statutory instrument service which he considers to be closely associated with the activities outside the united kingdom of her majestys government in the united kingdom <e> <s> this amendment would seek to make it clear that service with an international organisation could be designated in this way provided of course that the secretary of state considered that the service was closely associated with the activities outside the united kingdom of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the government i am extremely grateful for what has been said in welcoming these amendments <e> <s> the position of my right honourable friend the secretary of state and my honourable friend the minister of state with particular responsibility in this area has i think always been that this is a difficult matter and that all the arguments would be carefully listened to and considered <e> <s> therefore there is nothing that i think can properly be called a turn it is simply a natural result of the process of consideration which we had envisaged <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to confirm at the outset that formally this amendment certainly can stand independently of amendments nos <e> <s> and which we have moved to clause and to which your lordships have been kind enough to agree <e> <s> having said that i believe it is fairly plain that the concepts which underly this clause are rather like those in clause before it was amended <e> <s> this clause is seeking to confer british citizenship primarily by reference to the circumstances of the adult himself although it is true that his father or mother must be <e>", "<cs> my lords i had undertaken on behalf of the government to consider the amendments very carefully and of course we have done just that <e> <s> we appreciate the concern among many groups in scotland that scottish gaelic should be recognised in this way <e> <s> on the other hand as i pointed out in committee there are unlikely to be many cases where applicants for naturalisation will need or wish to meet the language requirement in scottish gaelic <e> <s> however we are very much aware of the strength of feeling on this matter and we appreciate the concern that is felt that gaelic should as an indigenous language have equal status with english and welsh in this particular context <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships house always listens with great interest and care to what my noble friend lord renton has to say in connection with the drafting of statutes <e> <s> we know that he has taken a deep interest in the clarity and logic of our legislation over a long period of time and many of your lordships know that i owe my opportunities of addressing your lordships to one of the recommendations of the committee in that connection over which he presided <e> <s> notwithstanding the debt of gratitude which i owe him for that i regret to say that i cannot advise your lordships to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is identical i think to one moved by the noble lord lord gifford in the committee stage and we have certainly carefully considered the arguments that he then advanced <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord elystan-morgan has this afternoon simply given an example as it were to test those arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords i would confirm in the first instance that the clause in the bill has the effect that the secretary of state may not deprive a person of citizenship under the caluse on the ground stated in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am concerned only to point out that the circumstances in which statelessness can result from the exercise of the power include those in paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps before your lordship agree to grant that leave i could clarify the situation a little further <e> <s> subsection deals with deprivation of citizenship which in effect was wrongly obtained <e> <s> if all that has happened is that something has been wrongly obtained there seems to be little demerit in effect in going back to the <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said this is a matter to which we have given much consideration since the bill was in committee and the amendments which we have proposed most of which i have had the honour of moving to remove from the bill any reference to the secretary of states satisfaction are intended to make it as clear as the words of the bill can make it that what we have in mind is entitlement provided the circumstances are met <e> <s> there is the amendment to be moved in a little while to which my noble friend lord colville of culross referred which makes it clear that the later provisions of the bill are not intended to cut down any remedy in this class of case which would otherwise be available <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend undertook to look at this matter as a result of the previous amendment on this subject which the noble lord lord avebury proposed <e> <s> we have done that but i regret that we do not see that the present amendment is really an improvement <e> <s> as the noble lord has already said this phrase appears in section of the british nationality act and has not given rise to any difficulties <e> <s> being of unsound mind has in the past normally been generously interpreted for nationality purposes as being unable to grasp even dimly the purpose of an application for citizenship or of taking <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the view that the word urgently is not necessary and indeed it is undesirable <e> <s> accordingly i suggest that your lordships should agree with the commons in their amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment reflects the governments acceptance of representations made in another place that the introduction of a civil sanction for breach of the provisions relating to the disclosure of information regarding the ownership of businesses carried on under business names would provide a desirable reinforcement of the criminal sanction for breach of those provisions <e> <s> we had originally consulted on the case for including a provision on the lines of section of the act but the consultations suggested that such a sweeping power would not be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords the enforcement procedure which is incorporated in this amendment is by way of preventing a person who is in breach of his obligations from enforcing his contract in the defined circumstances and therefore i cannot see that any kind of manpower requirement is at all involved here <e> <s> it is between the parties to the contract that this point would arise as an incident of litigation between them if it came to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> one of the results of the recent industrial action within the civil service was that the index of company names was not updated by the registrar of companies between th march and rd august inclusive and was therefore not

far as prospective relief is concerned the situation is that we have provided a date for that which i think is th february which is the date on which the proposals were first made <e> <s> would hope

permissible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> and i should like to speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> we are now in the area to which the noble lord lord wedderburn referred in the course of his remarks in the earlier debate <e> <s> these amendments make important changes to clause of the bill <e> <s> clause was

company <e> <s> some of your lordships will remember that we had a good deal of debate on this at earlier stages of the bill in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it would be right for me to say in general terms that the government have tried to consult on these technical matters as widely and as fully as possible <e> <s> nevertheless having so consulted the responsibility for the amendments is that of the government <e> <s> even if we had consulted on the absolute final detail of the amendment i would still say that the government had that responsibility <e> <s> i am seeking to inquire in what detail this was put to the ccab but it would be quite unfair for me to do more than to say that we benefited very much from their help and we understood that at least in general terms the ccab were in agreement with it <e> <s> so far as the other bodies which we consulted are concerned i would feel very much the same thing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wedderburn asked whom we had consulted <e> <s> our main external consultations were with the law society the representatives of the banks and finance for industry who have considerable experience of management buy-outs of the type to which the noble lord lord seebohm referred <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord wedderburn will have in mind that the department of trade has its own prosecution branch and of course the companies inspectorate were also closely involved in these matters <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am of course well aware of that and that is the principal improvement on this aspect that we want to make that instead of as it were drawing a bow at a venture the old section identified in part what the mischief was and that was when it was talking about purpose <e> <s> when

now the energy act their provisions on the supply and use of gas included in section the possibility of giving consent by means of orders of general application <e> <s> we are merely following that

of resources this will depend on where the consents are required <e> <s> the point is that the secretary of state has given an assurance which i suggest your lordships can rely upon that he will not give his consent until a check has been carried out <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to give the british gas corporation a privileged position in securing access to gas supplies by empowering the secretary of state to require that other suppliers apply for consents to supply if he has reason to believe that the gas is required by consumers within the area of the british gas corporations statutory obligation to supply even although the private supplier would not in general be obliged to require consent because his proposed supply exceeded million therms a year <e> <s> the noble lord lord beswick in putting forward this amendment has argued that this is a necessary special privilege to the british gas corporation <e> <s> we cannot accept that argument <e> <s> we must not forget that even under present legislation british gas corporation has no assurance of obtaining gas supplies or even of a right to bid for supplies <e> <s> at present the corporation has certain statutory purchasing privileges under sections and of the energy act but these in no way guarantee that licensees will agree to develop their gas reserves <e> <s> in fact the present law has had the opposite effect and one of the governments primary objectives in this bill is to provide renewed incentive for exploration and development of gas resources <e> <s> indeed i think the noble lord tacitly accepted this point at least to some extent in what he said <e>", "<cs> i just want to assure the noble lord that i understand precisely the amendment that he has moved and that my reply is intended to meet it and of course in my opinion it certainly does so very adequately <e>", "<cs> i expect your lordships will not be very surprised if i say that the government do not agree with this amendment and i am talking just to be sure about it about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the government have made it abundantly clear that the fundamental purpose of clause is to permit private suppliers to compete with the british gas corporation in the supply of gas in great britain <e> <s> we believe that this is an area which subject to proper safeguards is one in which private suppliers have a part to play and in which the economic development of the country will be assisted by their playing their proper part <e>", "<cs> the clarity with which the noble lord moved the amendment makes great amends for the lateness with which it was first presented <e> <s> modifications could include work which affected intellectual property rights <e> <s> our view at the moment is that the general words describing the sums which the secretary of state is empowered to consider should be paid to the corporation would be enough to cover the kind of considerations to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> but i certainly undertake to look at the matter in the light of his explanation to see whether anything further seems to be required in connection with it <e> <s> we willingly accept his suggestion to save a letter by adding a supplement to the earlier promised letter on the matter <e>", "<cs> first may i refer to the burgoyne report which as the noble lord said was a very comprehensive document <e> <s> so far as i know only two recommendations of the burgoyne report required primary legislation <e> <s> the first was the recommendation that suggested clarification of the legal status under the act of accommodation installations <e> <s> that is provided for in clause where the safety provisions under the act are extended to cover accommodation installations <e> <s> the second recommendation that would require primary legislation was the suggestion that the united kingdom civil and criminal law should he applied to vessels engaged in pipe-line works and to attendant vessels <e> <s> there are very formidable difficulties as the noble lord will appreciate in doing that in view of the international law situation <e> <s> the extent to which a coastal state may claim and seek to exercise powers on the high seas even in special circumstances is very narrowly defined <e> <s> it is important also to recognise that there is little use in taking powers if in practice it is likely to prove impossible to enforce them <e> <s> what we have done is to take the opportunity of this bill to make legislative provision on the lines of the first of those recommendations the second one being very much more difficult for the reason i have given <e>", "<cs> there is not a great deal of substance between us on this matter <e> <s> the noble lord is in effect transferring paragraph of schedule to clause <e> <s> clause is concerned with the criminal law and one possible consequence of putting the provision into clause might be to make people think that it was the criminal aspects of the patents act <e>", "<cs> the clause alters the existing legislation in two main ways <e> <s> first it gets rid of inconsistencies in the present wording of the and acts <e> <s> in particular as now amended these provisions make the powers of constables extend to exactly the same areas on under and above installations and waters within metres of such installations as the criminal law applies instead of merely on under and above the installation itself <e> <s> that is the power provided to her majesty by order in council <e>", "<cs> this clause is not a mechanism for applying united kingdom statutes generally offshore <e> <s> that is a matter for the statutes themselves and if one is asking whether a particular act applies offshore then one has to look at the particular act in order to ascertain that <e> <s> this clause is a re-enactment with amendments of subsections and of section of the continental shelf act and the civil law provisions of section of the mineral workings offshore installations act enabling the civil law to be applied in relation to acts or omissions taking place not only in designated areas and territorial waters as at present but also in tidal waters the foreign sectors of cross-boundary fields and in certain circumstances waters adjacent to the united kingdom sector but in a foreign sector of the continental shelf <e> <s> these acts or omissions are defined with reference to activities which are themselves defined in subsection <e> <s> they are similar to those to which it is proposed that the safety provisions of the act will apply <e> <s> so in order to attract the civil law provisions of this clause the acts or omissions require to be related to the activities which are set out in subsection of the clause <e> <s> the order in council procedure which was used under section is of course retained <e>", "<cs> it is always a question of what is the most convenient arrangement for legislation <e> <s> the form of clause is to re-enact with amendments subsections and of section of the continental shelf act <e> <s> accordingly it does not have to bear to be an amendment because you are substituting the new provision for the original provision <e> <s> that therefore is a situation in which it is not necessary expressly to amend and i think i have heard noble lords here express difficulty in trying to read two provisions together the original provision plus the amendment <e> <s> in this case we have tried to make it easier by putting the whole provision together anew and of course the noble lord will have noticed i am sure that in clause he is told that section of the act ceases to have effect because it is superseded by clause and clause <e> <s> so he is told that the matter of the earlier provision is superseded and it is made as easy as we can make it for him by putting the whole thing in including the amendments so that he can read the whole thing at once <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether i should take the questions that i have been asked in order of importance or in the order in which they came if these are different <e> <s> this clause deals with the fourth main subject of part iv that is the safety regime <e> <s> section of the mineral workings offshore installations act defines the operations and offshore installations to which the safety rgime set up under that act applies <e> <s> section of the petroleum and submarine pipe-lines act then extended the application of the act to certain installations connected with undersea pipe-lines <e>", "<cs> i should like to assure the noble lord that that consultation is of the essence of successful regulations <e> <s> my right honourable friend is well aware of that and will certainly do so <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord ross of marnock has said we are now dealing with one of his children and i shall try to do so as tenderly as i can <e> <s> the offshore petroleum development scotland act refers as its name indicates only to scotland <e> <s> there are no similar powers for england and wales either existing or proposed in this particular bill <e> <s> but in view of the developments in techniques offshore it was thought right as a natural development of the purposes of the act which the noble lord introduced to extend the provisions so that the secretary of state will have identical powers so far as purposes relating to offshore gas storage are concerned as he has at the moment for offshore petroleum development <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> i cannot accept that <e> <s> however i have undertaken to consider the drafting points which the noble lord has made at more leisure than is convenient at the moment <e>", "<cs> i think i could answer the noble lords question but it might be safer for me not to do so until i have checked the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to the point raised by the noble lord lord bruce of donington i think i am able to distinguish between the kind of clarification for which he is asking in relation to earlier amendments and the kind of point which this amendment is designed to cover <e> <s> it was fairly plain i think from what i said that as long ago as and for many years thereafter people understood that the underlying law had the effect that the act applied to territorial waters <e> <s> some years later it has now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly happy to look at it again <e> <s> naturally as the noble lord is aware it was not my original formulation but it certainly seemed to cover the matters <e> <s> but i shall certainly seek advice as to whether his suggestion might be regarded as an improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of extending the safety regime to flotels which is the main <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already explained

another part of the united kingdom and then served there as if it were a writ of that court <e> <s> this ensures that the maintenance debtor in another part of the united kingdom gets actual service of the initial writ <e> <s> the amendment of section is made necessary by the repeal by the present bill of sections and of the act which gave jurisdiction in particular circumstances against persons resident elsewhere in the united kingdom and their replacement by the more general provision of article of schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment to paragraph of schedule part ii corrects certain deficiencies in the amendment to section of the consumer credit act as it formerly appeared in the bill <e> <s> that is the purpose of the amendment and i do not think i need to explain it further <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wedderburn started off by referring to one of my hegelian moods <e> <s> there may be advantage on occasions even on a subject of this kind for being somewhat philosophical <e> <s> the situation so far as the government are concerned is that the special provisions which are incorporated in clause are still to be considered and i do not know that i can necessarily accept from the noble lord lord molloy or even from my noble friend lord campbell of alloway that legal disputes are necessarily avoided by making particular statutory provisions <e> <s> for these reasons i do not feel persuaded that this particular amendment should be acceptable to your lordships and i would remain of the view that i expressed earlier that i cannot advise your lordships to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> the government understanding of the position on this bill is that sums awarded under this clause would not be awarded by way of damages for the purposes of section as the amendment suggests <e> <s> the governments view is that the special limitations to which the amendment refers are not appropriate to responsibility of unions under this clause <e>", "<cs> in our submission clause is a rather modest measure which is designed to tidy up the existing provisions and make them more workable just as the labour government did in and <e> <s> despite what has been said we are introducing no new principles no hidden weapons against employees who choose to strike and no new attack on union power <e> <s> we are maintaining the principle enshrined in legislation since that if an employer discriminates between employees taking industrial action in like circumstances he risks having to justify his action before an industrial tribunal <e>", "<cs> i venture to think that the noble baroness lady burton of coventry has underlined as so often she does if i may say so with respect the confusion which has existed in a good deal of what has been said about this clause <e> <s> the clause deals with provisions requiring a proposed party to a contract to recognise a union or to recognise its negotiating procedures <e> <s> it does not deal with rates of pay and as i understand the position the fair wages resolution of the house of commons is not in breach of this clause indeed i think that the noble lord lord oram who raised that matter accepted that to be so <e> <s> he said that they were coming close but this certainly is not in conflict with that resolution because of the distinction between conditions of work and recognition of a union <e>", "<cs> before i answer that question completely i would need to look at the detailed provision that the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> on a proper reading of the clause i certainly would not regard this clause as striking at the consultation provisions of the health and safety at work act <e>", "<cs> yes as i understand the position the noble baroness lady seear is perfectly right <e> <s> indeed that is what i was trying to say <e>", "<cs> the purpose of subsections and of clause is to remove immunity from industrial action to interfere with the supply of goods or services from another employer on the grounds that the work in connection with these goods or services is to be or has been done by non-union or union employees <e> <s> as with the imposition of union membership requirements by employers it does not make much sense to consider in these cases as these amendments would have us do whether union membership was a major or a minor factor <e> <s> if it was a factor at all in the unions action then in our view it is right that the immunity should be removed <e> <s> if the action is taken for other reasons altogether then the immunity is retained <e> <s> that seems to us to be a reasonable criterion and to justify your lordships in not accepting this amendment <e>", "<cs> a good deal of the latter part of the noble lords speech in relation to clause suffers <e> <s> i suggest from the same sort of confusion as was pointed out by the noble baroness lady burton in connection with an earlier debate <e> <s> the fact that these clauses seek to preserve for employers and employees the right to manage their own affairs without outside interference is in no way to promote cowboy outfits in relation to safety or to promote sweated labour or anything of that sort <e> <s> the conditions in which trade unions are able to invite people to join today are surely very different from those which prevailed in the history to which the noble lord has been kind enough to treat us this afternoon <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says they may be but that shows that the mere fact of this sort of provision being put in has very little to do with conditions <e> <s> it is a very different situation that the union wishes to achieve by pressure of this kind <e> <s> it is to have the union recognised rather than specially to promote any particular conditions of employment <e> <s> these practices are common in some industries particularly where there is a long tradition of union membership or a high level of sub-contracting <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord will remember when i introduced the amendment with the new clause about union recognition i explained that the matter concerning this particular aspect had been drawn to our attention since the bill was published <e> <s> but the principle upon which it rests is exactly the same and the reason that it is obnoxious is exactly the same as the reason in principle upon which clause itself rests <e>", "<cs> if i correctly took the quotation which the noble lord gave from my right honourable friend who was then the secretary of state for employment he was making it clear that it was not the intention of the government to deal with that particular matter in the bill <e> <s> the quotation does not suggest that it would not be appropriate to deal with it on a future occasion once these matters had been consulted upon <e>", "<cs> at first sight this might look a rather technical amendment but as the noble lord lord wedderburn has explained it and i think that if one had thought about it even without the benefit of his help it would have appeared so it goes to the very heart of clause in practical application <e> <s> in a case where a trade union was responsible for unlawful industrial action it would prevent an employer seeking an immediate interlocutory injunction against that trade union ordering it to call the action off <e> <s> if he wanted to proceed against the trade union itself he would have to wait for a full hearing of the case possibly weeks or months later <e>", "<cs> i may have misheard the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton but thought he said that the effect of his amendment would be to make the common law rules about agency apply to all torts including interference with the contract type of case <e> <s> if i did hear him correctly then i believe that is not so <e> <s> his amendment would have the effect of applying the new rules to all torts <e>", "<cs> before i try to deal with the main matter may i say that in relation to the last point made by the noble lord the advice we have and i must say without being impertinent that i agree with it is that where <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord mccarthy has explained these amendments bring us to the provisions which set out when a union should be held liable for unlawful acts committed by its officials and members in the course of industrial action <e> <s> those provisions are set out in subsections to of the clause <e> <s> i should like to address myself immediately to the point that the noble lord lord rochester has raised <e> <s> the purpose of these provisions is to try to make these ideas in relation to union liability fit in with practical reality <e> <s> as i said earlier <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to alter paragraph <e>", "<cs> as i understood the purpose of the amendment as explained by the noble lord lord wedderburn it would have the effect of preventing a union from being held liable for unlawful acts authorised by employed officials and the committees to which they report until the union receives a written complaint from someone affected <e> <s> such a principle is unacceptable to the government because it gives unions further special privileges in law which runs counter to the basic aim of bringing their position into line with that of their officials and members <e> <s> it may in practice often be wise for an employer to write to the union to put it on warning that unlawful industrial action is taking place in order to give it an opportunity to try to get the action stopped <e> <s> but we do not agree that an employer should be under an obligation to inform the union in this way <e>", "<cs> i wanted to say in answer to the noble lord lord underhill that on behalf of the government i have endeavoured to understand the amendments proposed from his side of the committee and i have endeavoured to set out as fully as i could consistent with my responsibility to make progress a reasonable answer to them <e> <s> there is no question of riding roughshod over the amendments as if they had not been put down at all <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to delete subsection of clause which sets out a number of circumstances in which the limits on damages shall not apply <e> <s> these are broadly proceedings for negligence nuisance or breach of duty which results in personal injury or for breach of duty in connection with the ownership or use of property <e> <s> the effect of this amendment would be to apply the limits to cases of this type <e>", "<cs> we will come to that particular matter in a moment <e> <s> the point i have to explain is based on what the noble lord lord davies of leek said first <e> <s> the justification for section is the present position as he has correctly explained <e> <s> so far as the power to amend by the secretary of state is concerned that is obviously to take account of possible changes in the value of money and it would be normal for the secretary of state to have power to vary such figures <e> <s> it would also be normal for that to be subject to negative resolution <e> <s> that is the way it is in this bill <e>", "<cs> there would be some difficulty in increasing downwards but certainly it might be possible <e> <s> the noble lord envisages the possibility that if this government continue it might be possible to envisage a situation where it would be appropriate to vary them downwards <e> <s> but the idea is to provide flexibility in the numbers provided on limits of damages <e>", "<cs> the basic position is that both paragraphs <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to alter subsection which sets out how to calculate the membership of federations of trade unions for the purposes of accessing limits on damages <e> <s> without this subsection the figure taken to determine the appropriate limit on damages in the case of federations would depend on how the federation itself defined its membership in its rules <e> <s> some federations such as the national union of mineworkers which is actually a federation of regional unions make it clear that their members are the individual workers who belong to each of the federated trade unions <e> <s> in such cases there would be no problems <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i need to add to what i have already said <e> <s> the situation is that it would be only if the tuc were to become involved in calling unlawful industrial action that this matter would arise <e> <s> i must say i do not see it as at all likely that that would happen <e>", "<cs> i think that the technical position is that i assumed for the purposes of this argument that the tuc would be covered <e> <s> i must say i think it will be covered by this particular provision but for the purposes of the argument i assumed that it was in order to deal with the matter which the noble lord lord mccarthy raised <e>", "<cs> i am certainly anxious to move to the next business as quickly as i can <e> <s> the situation so far as the tuc is concerned must depend on section of the act and of course if somebody wants to litigate about that that is up to them <e> <s> for the purposes of dealing with the amendment i assumed that and i must say there is a good deal to be said for it <e> <s> if the tuc is not a trade union i am not sure it would have any immunity anyway so the problem would not arise <e> <s> as for giving the noble lord an assurance that i shall consider what he said i hope it goes without saying that i will always consider what he says and if that helps to speed matters forward i shall be very glad <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> i think the point of view from which you start to look at this clause is important <e> <s> perhaps just before plunging into the detail i could say a few words about our general attitude to disputes which relate to matters occurring overseas <e> <s> we are not seeking to outlaw such disputes altogether but we do not think that it is satisfactory that under the present definition of a trade dispute workers in this country can undertake damaging industrial action in the united kingdom in support of a dispute overseas when they have no involvement in the dispute and are not affected by its outcome <e>", "<cs> perhaps all i need say is that i have no intention of being rash <e>", "<cs> the government have great sympathy with the aims of this amendment <e> <s> there is no doubt that british industry has suffered over the years from too great a willingness on the part of workers and trade unions to go on strike or to take other industrial action before the agreed procedures for resolving disputes have been exhausted <e> <s> the result has sometimes been needless and damaging disruption of production which might have been avoided if the agreed procedures had been followed <e> <s> achieving a greater observance of procedure agreements could bring a greater stability and predictability into industrial relations which in the long run could only be of benefit to employers and employees alike <e>", "<cs> the present wording of the act literally interpreted leaves some room for doubt as to whether claims for tribunal awards of this kind made after the event so to speak should be met from the redundancy fund <e> <s> as far as the department of employment who manage the fund were concerned however these doubts were resolved in employees favour by the unreported industrial tribunal decision of <e>", "<cs> i should like to take this opportunity in answering the noble lord lord underhill to go somewhat wide of the present amendment in order to try to explain the position in relation to fixed penalties under the bill for scotland <e> <s> i am sorry that i was unable to be here on the last occasion when the question arose <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lady macleod of borve was kind enough to hope that the lord advocate would come out of the mist and be able to dispel the fog that seemed to be surrounding the provisions <e>", "<cs> i may have misheard the noble lady lady saltoun <e> <s> was she speaking about a motorist normally resident in scotland who is convicted in england <e>", "<cs> so far as that is concerned if anyone is brought to court for an endorsable offence and that is the situation to which we are referring there is an obligation to give the licence to the court so that the court may have the licence endorsed <e>", "<cs> i have not made the position sufficiently clear and it is entirely my fault <e> <s> if a motorist is asked by a policeman to produce his licence and fails to do so there is an obligation to produce it within five days at a police station <e> <s> there is nothing being done in this bill in any way to affect that or make it impossible to perform that obligation in scotland <e> <s> in the case which the noble lord lord paget of northampton has figured where the motorist happened to be resident in scotland at the time when this had occurred and was asked in england to produce his licence he could produce it when he got home and that would be perfectly satisfactory <e> <s> there is no problem <e>", "<cs> i should first like to underline what the noble lord lord mishcon said if one accepts the fixed penalty notice in this type of case he has been describing then the licence will be endorsed <e> <s> so a driver who commits an endorsable offence and wishes to argue that there are special reasons in his particular case for non-endorsement will require not to accept the fixed penalty notice and go to court <e> <s> of course once a person gets a fixed penalty notice he has time to consider his position and take advice about it <e> <s> so far as scotland is concerned the amendment which i am dealing with just now provides that the maximum penalties for the offence apart from the fixed penalty will be specified in the case to which the amendment relates <e> <s> so if the motorist reads he will see the provision about disqualification unless there are special reasons <e>", "<cs> certainly we will do what we can to respond to that <e>", "<cs> i would think that the point which was raised on amendment no <e> <s> and in respect of which my noble friend lord avon gave an undertaking in that discussion is a slightly different point from the one with which i have just been dealing <e> <s> so far as i understand the point my noble friend has put to me the fact that one has an option after one gets the fixed penalty notice is not damaging to the system because what we are expecting is that the vast majority of people who get a fixed penalty notice will after due consideration make use of it <e> <s> it is that which eliminates the substantial burden on the courts which we are trying to eliminate <e> <s> so long as the person has an understanding of what his rights are after he gets the <e>", "<cs> the amendment which my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth has moved is an amendment to delete lines and from schedule which will have the effect and the effect only of deleting the enactment section and the description of the offence of driving with uncorrected defective eyesight <e> <s> in other words he is not seeking to amend the provision dealing with failure to furnish the secretary of state when required with evidence of date of birth <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord underhill happened to get involved in one of the offences listed in schedule and i sincerely hope that he does not on his forthcoming scottish holiday he would because we have the system of a procurator fiscal be able to have that dealt with without any inconvenience of court <e> <s> now why because we have that system should we make use of it simply because in the particular arrangements available in england that possibility does not exist <e> <s> it does not mean any injustice <e> <s> it just means that if you happen to be in scotland you can be dealt with in this particular matter more conveniently than happens to be the case in england <e>", "<cs> as i explained we have amalgamated this clause and the result is that clause as printed in the bill should be deleted <e> <s> i therefore ask your lordships not to allow this clause to stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the draftsman would be the first to acknowledge any help that the noble and learned lord might have thought fit to offer him on an improvement of this matter but the problem with which the provision deals is as i said rather technical <e> <s> i think it might be possible to read the amendment in a way which would convey its sense even better than the reading that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones was able to do for us but i fear that in <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem with regard to amendments of this kind is to know to which other offences one should relate them <e> <s> however in the very particular circumstances and awaiting perhaps a more general review of offences in this area i would be prepared to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble and learned lord means that the schedule is incomprehensible to him or the explanation is incomprehensible <e> <s> at the committee stage amendments were made in the interests of simplicity to take into schedule all the special increases in maximum fines specified in schedule with the result that schedule became unnecessary <e> <s> therefore i think it is reason <e>", "<cs> my lords listening to some of the speeches in connection with the amendment i am reminded of someone who in your lordships house told me the other day that they had been pressing hard for the enforcement of the speed limit in a particular locality and not long after they pressed successfully for that they were the first to be prosecuted <e>", "<cs> my lords the government show their generosity by moving amendment no <e> <s> notwithstanding the fact that amendments nos <e> <s> a and b have been carried <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is a matter i can look at further <e> <s> i do not believe it is right to delay the house at this point to try to explain this further <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought it might be easier for me to explain this later to the noble lord lord wigoder but if your lordships wish me to do it now i certainly shall and that is the third shall <e> <s> if your lordships look at line you see that what is provided there is <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the answer to that is short and immediate <e> <s> the law without the amendment is the same as the law with the amendment <e> <s> the amendment appears to me to be unnecessary and confusing <e> <s> the union will be held liable only if the court regards the pressure as exerted truly on behalf of the union or exerted truly by the union <e> <s> so the point that the noble lord lord molloy made is very properly met a point which think ought to be met and is met <e> <s> i hope for these reasons that your lordships will find it possible not to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord underhill has explained this amendment would preserve an anomaly in the existing provisions which clause seeks to correct <e> <s> it may be helpful if i seek to remind your lordships of the background <e> <s> when the principle that employees have a right not to be unfairly dismissed was introduced for the first time in by the then conservative government it was decided that a balance had to be struck between the need for employers to be able to dismiss employees in fundamental breach of their contracts and the right of individual employees to be protected against dismissal which could be accounted unfair even though by their actions they had repudiated their contract of employment <e> <s> the balance was struck in the test of discrimination which is currently set out in section of the employment protection consolidation act <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the amendment it seeks to define the phrase taking part in the action which i must say at first sight seems a fairly simple phrase readily comprehensible by a fairly long formula and not to do much more than that <e> <s> as the noble lord lord oram has said the amendment is concerned with the definition of relevant employees <e> <s> the amendment aims to include explicitly in the definition of relevant employees all employees with the same or a connected interest in the dispute and all employees involved in industrial action irrespective of the form the action takes <e> <s> we believe that these classes of employees are already included in the provisions and as it seems to us included more simply in the phrase taking part in the action <e> <s> when one looks at the factual situation one sees what the action is and you just take all the employees taking part in that <e> <s> i must say with great respect that i do not see that the noble lords amendment adds anything to that or does anything to effect the general purpose he mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords with this amendment we return to the question of who can bring a legal action for a breach of statutory duty under clause and since we did not perhaps debate this <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment as has been explained is primarily designed to exempt members of for example the british actors equity associations with the particular arrangements that they have from the provisions of clause <e> <s> because the principles are the same in relation to the later amendments to which the noble lord lord jenkins of putney referred it is helpful to discuss them all at the same time <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> all i can do is to state the position as i understand it to be <e> <s> it may be just as well to clear up the point in case there is any misunderstanding <e> <s> i am sure it will be in the nature of a misunderstanding and not anything deliberate in the way of misleading people <e> <s> it is useful that we should take the opportunity to dispose of any misunderstanding which may exist and i am obliged to the noble lord for what he has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the resolution which is in question is a resolution of the house of commons and it seems reasonably plain that no one but the house of commons can rescind that resolution <e> <s> accordingly until the house of commons does so the fair wages resolution of the house of commons will stand <e> <s> it is only an intimation from the secretary of state of his decision to put this matter before the house of commons that has been <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i would think it inappropriate for me to make any intimation in relation to what the secretary of state proposes with regard to a matter which is peculiarly within the province of the house of commons namely affecting its own resolution <e> <s> the secretary of state intimated that to the house of commons immediately it was appropriate for him to do so in answer to a question which was then put <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble lord lord oram for confirming that the stance that i took in relation to this matter when we debated it at the committee stage was that this clause does not affect the position with regard to fair wages <e> <s> therefore it appears to me that the question with regard to the fair wages resolution of the house of commons is a different matter and is one which will be properly debated in due course in that house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is usually good advice to lawyers not to advise on hypothetical questions <e> <s> this looks like a fairly hypothetical question and certainly would not think it right to offer advice about it <e> <s> the position so far as this clause is concerned and it is that which is relevant is that it in no way impinges on the right of one contractor to put into his contract a clause defining the conditions under which the people who work under the contract should work <e> <s> it was on that basis that i said at committee stage and i repeat now that this clause in no way affects the question of conditions that may be imposed by one contractor on the other party to the contract <e>", "<cs> my lords the leading provisions of these clauses deal with terms in contracts and of course there are later provisions founded on these with regard to matters which may be unlawful but the leading provisions in these two clauses relate to terms in contracts <e> <s> what i am saying with some confidence is that there is nothing in clause which in any way prevents a person who desires to do so from putting into his contract conditions regarding fair wages or fair terms as he sees them <e> <s> it is a term which requires the recognition of a trade union or requires someone to consult with or negotiate with an official of a union thereby of course implying some form of relationship with the union official that this clause is dealing with <e> <s> accordingly i respectfully suggest to your lordships that the fair wages resolution of the house of commons has nothing whatever to do with the terms of this particular clause and is not affected by it in one way or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have explained already and i do not think that i can do so more clearly <e> <s> all i can do is to repeat myself which might not be regarded as particularly economical <e> <s> i have already said that the provisions of section of the act of stand completely unaffected by the provisions of this bill <e> <s> the provisions that are in issue are the provisions which require employers to consult with the committees there set out <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill which in any way takes away from the force of that provision and the result in my submission is that this particular amendment on that aspect of the matter is not acceptable and should not be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords the provisions of clause are concerned with any term or condition of a contract for the supply of goods or services and such a term or condition is made void if it purports to do the things mentioned in paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships perhaps i should add a few words <e> <s> the suggestion that the noble lord lord wedderburn had put forward is one that was considered <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins of putney between committee and report kindly provided us and myself in particular with the documentation to which he referred at the committee stage <e> <s> so the situation has been carefully considered <e> <s> the reason that the noble lord lord wedderburn has advanced namely that many people would be affected by the change is precisely why we think that those many people require protection which the clause affords and it is also why we are unwilling to change in the manner that he suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord lord wedderburn will assume that what he says about this matter and what he has said about these matters i would carefully consider without the necessity of expressly saying so <e> <s> the situation so far as mixed proceedings are concerned i sought to explain on the last occasion and such consideration as i have been able to give it since suggests to my mind that the answer which i gave them is correct <e> <s> indeed i think the form of the noble lords amendment suggests that he thinks that too <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments bring us again to the question of when a trade union should be held liable for the unlawful acts of its officials and officers <e> <s> it is a question which as many noble lords remember caused considerable difficulty between and <e> <s> the purpose of subsections to of clause is to reduce the chances of that difficulty arising again by providing clear and realistic guidance on the question of trade union liability <e>", "<cs> my lords what is common sense is sometimes a difficult question <e> <s> i am not sure that the reference to sir winston churchill particularly carries forward the argument <e> <s> i am sure if he had got to the presidency of the bricklayers union he would have conducted the affairs of the union with great propriety <e>", "<cs> my lords he would certainly have been an ornament and if he had worked as the noble baroness says he would have been a working ornament but he would have worked so well that the question of liability would not have arisen <e> <s> perhaps i could bring this to an end by saying that in our view the rules which have been set out are plain accord with industrial reality and i do not feel able to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must tell the noble lord lord lloyd that i was dealing in my earlier remarks with a remark which the noble lord lord wedderburn made that we had in some way provided that the union rules were to be ignored and it was that which i disputed <e> <s> so far as i know there is no provision in the clause which so provides <e> <s> as i said earlier obviously we consider all that is said but i have not seen any occasion to make me wish to modify my position in the light of what i have so far heard <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to change the provision in subsection of clause which is designed to clarify exactly what is to be regarded as the unions rules for the purpose of deciding union liability for the purpose of applying the provisions of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has explained very plainly the problem as he sees it in this set of provisions <e> <s> i do not need to go into the full background <e> <s> as the noble lord explained while the exemptions in the act apply only where there is no lawful trade dispute the exemptions in this clause apply whether or not there is a trade dispute <e> <s> this is because we are taking this opportunity to correct what we regard as an anomaly whereby cases of this sort are treated differently depending on whether there is or is not a trade dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment as the noble lord explained seeks to introduce a wider category of protected property from which no awards of damages costs or expenses could be made in any proceedings involving the industrial torts that is those concerned with breach of contracts <e> <s> this new category of protected property would cover any fund which the union rules prevented from being used to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wedderburn has referred to the fact that the provision which is the subject of his amendment was the subject also of an amendment in the other place <e> <s> he pointed out as though to explain it that the amendment came from the government benches <e> <s> perhaps he forgets his success in obtaining acceptance of one of his amendments on the last consideration of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord makes two points <e> <s> the first is a legal point and i shall try to deal with it briefly <e> <s> he says that in section <e>", "<cs> my lords i say straightaway that i have the greatest sympathy with the sense of outrage which has prompted my noble friends lord mottistone and lord campbell of alloway to <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt my noble friend will explain the reason for his dissent but certainly my understanding of the position is that this amendment would not generally give to the patients in the national health service any remedies that they do not already have <e> <s> furthermore i must point out that even if we wanted to accept this amendment there are difficulties about it in its present form <e> <s> i need not take up much time with that but the reference to industrial action i think would require some elaboration because the phrase does not appear in statute at present <e>", "<cs> yes my lords there are the remedies available in these provisions <e> <s> of course whether or not the remedy is available in a particular case depends on the circumstances of the case <e> <s> all i can do is to indicate the position generally as i have sought to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not wish to delay the house by involving myself in too detailed a legal argument but the reason i made the statement that i have done which i was challenged about by my noble friend is something which i am very happy to explain if your lordships will give me leave to do so <e> <s> this provision is for the removal of an immunity <e> <s> it does not create a right of action and therefore you have to ascertain whether there is a right of action to start with <e> <s> my understanding is that the generality of patients in the health service will not have a contractual right of action <e> <s> therefore since this amendment is eliminating an immunity against a right of action depending upon interference with contract since there is no contract to interfere with in the generality of cases the removal of this immunity would put nothing in its-place <e> <s> that is the final reason why i made the explanation that i did <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said this is ground we have covered already <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins of putney was good enough to read out the letter i sent to him which makes the position reasonably plain <e> <s> i do not have much to add to that so far as amendment no <e> <s> a is concerned <e> <s> the noble lord has concentrated on amendment no <e> <s> b and so far as i have understood this amendment it does not distinguish between cassandra and vicky on the one hand and the window cleaners and lift people on the other <e> <s> it seeks to exclude from contracts for the supply of goods or services contracts the performance of which wholly or mainly involves one party providing personal services for the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged for the remarks the noble and learned lord made towards the end of his address <e> <s> as for the earlier matters he acknowledged that it is not the first time that provisions relating to substantive scottish criminal law have appeared in a criminal justice bill and the long title of this measure makes it clear that there are provisions affecting scotland <e> <s> the provision to which the noble and learned lord referred clause reinstates something which had been taken out inadvertently in the act and this looked like a suitable opportunity to correct the error <e> <s> i am extremely glad to have this opportunity to say that we hope to consolidate the law relating to criminal procedure in scotland basically on the act with the amendments which have been made to it since and i believe with the noble and learned lord that this will be to the advantage not only of practitioners in scotland but also of the public in scotland affected by these enactments <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be important at the outset to make it clear that the noble lord lord underhill is tilting at a windmill when he suggests that clause not the amendment makes it unlawful for someone to insist that someone else should consult his workpeople <e> <s> what it is dealing with is recognition of a trade union and consultation with a trade union as a stipulated way of consulting his workpeople and thus by a sidewind making it indispensable that that person has a recognised trade union of his employees before he can participate in tendering for the contract <e> <s> therefore a good deal of the moral argument which the noble lord put forward with his usual eloquence and obvious sincerity is with great respect somewhat misplaced as being directed against this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the noble lord has explained the amendment which he is putting forward if i have understood it correctly the purpose of the amendment is virtually to say that it will be perfectly lawful to do what the earlier part of the clause to which it has been added says will be actionable in tort <e> <s> and that it seems to me is saying that clause should in effect be deleted from the bill <e> <s> we had opportunities for that argument much earlier <e> <s> i would suggest that this amendment is virtually destructive of the clause itself and therefore i cannot advise your lordships to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord underhill said in moving this amendment this is a subject which we have discussed fairly fully before but in view of the interest that has been expressed in it i hope that your lordships will forgive me if i speak on it at a little length <e>", "<cs> my lords the fixed penalty notice in respect of an offence committed in england is a type of notice which will not be familiar to the scottish police <e> <s> the procedure that has to be used to deal with that is quite different from the procedure involved in reporting a case to the procurator fiscal <e> <s> the fact that you have only a few customers in every police station or in any station does not in any way reduce the fact that the necessary provision has to be made in every police station <e> <s> it is the number of police stations which in effect creates the burden <e> <s> you cannot tell at any time how many people will come to the police station wanting this facility <e> <s> therefore it has to be provided everywhere <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that the view of the scottish police on this matter is very clear indeed and they are against clause for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall gladly consider the suggestion which the noble lord lord underhill just made <e> <s> it would of course be a matter for the authorities in england and wales <e> <s> i shall consult to see what can he done in that connection and i am grateful to the noble lord for the very constructive way in which he has dealt with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the word either refers to the or that occurs in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure i would agree with that <e> <s> but i think that that is what it means <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave the wording which is proposed to be added would i think take care of that situation <e> <s> the new words rely upon the objective of the test or analysis being satisfactorily achieved and the objective of the particular test with which the roadside screening test was concerned was to get a reading which reflected the likely level of alcohol in the blood of the subject <e> <s> i suppose that it does not require a great deal of imagination or scientific understanding to think that a gentleman who is able to get breath from his nostrils immediately into the apparatus will not produce a result that gives any reflection of the state of the alcohol in his blood i believe that this wording would deal with that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of devices approved for the purposes of different tests and i am not absolutely certain to which appliance the noble lord lord tanlaw is referring <e> <s> if he is thinking of the new apparatus which it is intended to bring into use shortly my understanding is that it is a british machine but i will certainly correct that if i am wrong <e> <s> i am relying on my memory of the apparatus that was brought to your lordships house in order that your lordships might see it when the main provisions were enacted in the bill last year <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am now able to rely on information other than my own recollections <e> <s> there are two machines on issue and both of them are made in the united kingdom <e> <s> in that sense they are british although one of them is of american origin in the sense that the design and the know-how originated in america <e> <s> however i understand that both machines are made in the united kingdom and i hope that answers the noble lords question satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> is intended to remove any doubt as to the effect of section of the act upon invalidity pension in assessing damages <e> <s> it is thought to be right that a united kingdom social security benefit should be treated in the same way throughout the united kingdom <e> <s> the amendment ensures that this is achieved without the amendment the present bill might be thought to override the earlier legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> these amendments give effect to the governments further consideration of the scope of relatives for the purposes of an action for damages <e> <s> as a significant minority of caring and stable relationships now exist outside marriage we have concluded that it would be unjust to deny to an injured persons unmarried partner the right to damages <e> <s> in order to be consistent the same extension is applied to the damages scotland act as to part ii of the bill in respect of damages for both loss of support which may he claimed by relatives of the deceased and loss of society which are restricted to claims from the immediate family <e> <s> as your lordships will remember a similar amendment was moved by my noble and learned friend in relation to the fatal accidents act for england and wales <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am naturally in entire agreement with the noble and learned lords wish to dispense with unnecessary and expensive preparatory work particularly by defence lawyers <e> <s> however the noble and learned lord will remember that this matter was fairly fully considered by the thomson committee in their second report and the instruction which has been given to procurators fiscal is intended to get the benefits of the practice without the difficulties to which he has referred <e> <s> finally may i say that we are keeping this matter very much under review <e> <s> i hope that in due course we shall be able to issue a consultation paper setting out the difficulties and possibly by study of them generally in scotland advancing consideration of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> four major changes are contained in this bill relating to scotland it gives the sheriff jurisdiction in divorce actions it enables the relaxation of the requirement for corroboration in certain classes of divorce action it confers on <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm that there are no substantive provisions which deal directly with that point <e> <s> it is conceivable that that matter could play a part in the procedural rules which the rules council will now go on to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i gather that the weight of opinion among those who have contributed to the debate is in favour of clause i of the bill and for that i am grateful <e> <s> in relation to the last question which the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey asked of his noble friend lord hughes the affidavit procedure was operating in the court of session at the time the royal commission was sitting so i think the question was not well based in fact <e> <s> the cowie procedure makes some difference but so far at any rate the cowie procedure is restricted in scope and the cases in which service in the sense in which lord hughes referred to it would be important would be the other cases <e> <s> in our view the reasoning which led the royal commission to think it was right that the sheriff courts should have jurisdiction in actions of divorce is sound reasoning and that is the basic principle on which this part of the bill rests <e>", "<cs> i am happy to seek to answer any matters the noble and learned lord puts at whatever time is convenient to him my lords <e> <s> i have tried to set out the principles as referred to in the command paper and the practical result of applying those principles <e> <s> obviously we can discuss the matter further in due course if he so wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend <e> <s> i had that question in mind but i <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is that it is for the sheriff courts rules council to make the rules <e> <s> i cannot usurp their function or forecast what they will do but i feel sure that the matters to which the noble lord referred will be very much before them particularly those concerned with the interests of children and the desirability of children being protected against any damage which may result to them from the court procedure and any question of privacy which is concerned in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that the sheriff courts rules council will have the proceedings of your lordships house on this bill before them when they are considering these matters <e> <s> to make sure perhaps i should undertake to draw their attention to the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for what he has just said so far as scotland is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and learned lord well knows my responsibilities relate to scotland and i am not aware of the detailed circumstances of the case to which he refers <e> <s> i am sure he must agree that the best judgment i can exercise upon it is to make no comment upon that particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all certain that i can agree with that as a general proposition <e> <s> indeed i think the progress of the law in england suggests that the view in this country would accord with my own because the amount of pre-trial pub-licity has i think gradually been reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could begin by acknowledging as i hope i have done in the past the work of the royal commission in this area presided over by the noble lord lord hughes <e> <s> i think it would be right for me to say that in putting forward this bill we have been very much indebted to them for the work that they have done and we have tried to follow what they have suggested in so far as we discerned that it was necesary to do so to get the benefits that they had in mind <e> <s> the recommendation as the noble lord <e>", "<cs> no not exactly <e> <s> what i am saying is that the benefits <e>", "<cs> delighted as i always am to make the noble lord happy and i have learned that it is a wise thing to do if i possibly can i think in fairness to myself i have to add the explanation that we came as near to what the royal commission proposed as we thought the circumstances justified <e> <s> we sought to get all the benefits of which they spoke without any particular disadvantage and of course as time goes on situations could change <e> <s> the royal commission did not say in what stages or in what way their recommendations should be implemented <e> <s> we are certainly not precluding for all time the possibility that matters could develop even closer to the royal commissions recommendation <e>", "<cs> if the pursuer decides to raise the action in the court of session then the action is competent in the court of session but i think the realities of the situation are that a pursuer would need to be persuaded that that was something in the <e>", "<cs> the person in kilmarnock i am assuming would go to his or her local solicitor who naturally this is ones experience would suggest the local sheriff court unless there were some good reason that he saw for not doing that <e>", "<cs> that is the question i was trying to answer <e> <s> the solicitor in kilmarnock would be unlikely to suggest going to the court of session unless he saw a special reason for doing so <e> <s> even in a simple case there might be a reason for doing so <e> <s> for example it could happen that at the particular time work in kilmarnock of other kinds was so great that one had to wait a long time in which case the solicitor might if his client was in a great hurry suggest going to the court of session where the procedure has become very streamlined <e> <s> i could think of other examples but perhaps it is not worth wearying your lordships with other possibilities <e>", "<cs> first i shold like to deal with the question which my noble friend lord selkirk raised <e> <s> the idea that the primary purpose of the clause is to save money is not an idea that i at all share <e> <s> the primary purpose of the clause is to give effect to the need which the royal commission saw for sheriff courts to have jurisdiction in divorce cases and in that connection the considerations to which the noble lord lord ross of marnock has just adverted are very strong <e> <s> it seems right not altogether from a point of money that the sheriff court should have jurisdiction to deal with divorce cases and that is the reason why we have proposed the clause <e> <s> i should be the last to have any part in any change which damaged the institution of marriage or its permanency <e> <s> i do not think that the clause does that <e> <s> it merely provides a procedure for dealing with the dovorce law as it is <e> <s> there is no change proposed in the substantive law of divorce <e>", "<cs> there are a number of matters about this clause which i could deal with <e> <s> however i wonder whether i can make a suggestion to the noble and learned lord regarding the way in which this matter might be dealt with <e> <s> i suggest that it might be dealt with by my undertaking to invite the faculty of advocates and the law society of scotland to prepare a list of those who would be willing to undertake this work <e> <s> i would undertake that if such a list was provided the scottish courts administration would circulate the list to sheriff clerks for the information of sheriffs and the judges of the court of session <e> <s> these lists would of course require to be updated from time to time <e> <s> if that meets the point that the noble and learned lord is making to his satisfaction then perhaps we need not trouble about the detail of the particular amendment <e>", "<cs> i want to make it clear that i understood the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey to be dealing only with legally-qualified people so far as this list is concerned because he is suggesting it is the court which puts the list together <e> <s> it has been said and certainly i agree that the majority of the reports that are obtained are obtained from social workers <e> <s> i would expect that to continue <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord lord hughes has said perhaps i should remind your lordships that the government have set up a detailed study into this matter <e> <s> the central research unit of the scottish office is undertaking a research project which deals with the exercise by the court of their functions in relation to the welfare and custody of children in divorce actions <e>", "<cs> the lords of council and session will not be involved in approving any particular list of names of people available but those names will be circulated to the sheriffs and judges by the scottish courts administration <e> <s> they would be receiving these lists from the scottish faculty of advocates and the law society of scotland <e>", "<cs> it is not really a regulation it is just a list of people who are willing to do the work <e> <s> if parliament wants to see the list there is absolutely no reason in the world why a list should not be put into the libraries of both houses if that was wanted <e> <s> it is just a list of names of people who are willing to undertake this work provided by the bodies i have mentioned <e> <s> there is no reason why it should not be available to anybody who wants to see it <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to draw attention to the amendment which was made in to section of the sheriff courts scotland act which permits the parties to move the sheriff or the sheriff of his own accord to decide what should happen in relation to a case of this sort <e> <s> in any ordinary case section allows a sheriff to remit to the court of session on the motion of any party to the cause if he is of the opinion that the issues raised are of sufficient importance and difficulty to make it appropriate to do so <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord has said his decision on a motion of this kind may be appealed to the court of session <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord has said this is entirely a drafting matter <e> <s> what we have done is to use the language of section of the law reform miscellaneous provisions scotland act <e> <s> the date is of course of some importance although the noble lord lord ross of marnock seems to have left his place <e> <s> the wording of that section has been the subject of judicial scrutiny and decision <e> <s> it is true that there has been some judicial disagreement as to its effect but that has now been settled <e> <s> the judges have decided what the effect should be <e> <s> the mere fact that there is disagreement does not necessarily mean that both were wrong or that there is anything particularly wrong with the clause <e> <s> the clause emphasises both the positive and the negative side of the matter <e> <s> we feel it would be unwise when we want to get exactly the same result as in section to go for different words <e> <s> if one goes for different words it is assumed that one is attempting a different result <e> <s> accordingly at the present time we would say that the words of section which we followed should be followed again <e>", "<cs> in my experience it would be utterly unthinkable to propose any order of this kind without consulting the lord president <e> <s> it is fair to say that i am privileged to consult the lord president on a great number of matters in which there is no statutory requirement for me to do so <e> <s> statutory requirements to consult the lord president involve the court of sessions interest in the registers of scotland that is rather a special field <e> <s> otherwise these matters proceed on understanding and i can certainly undertake for myself that i will always consult the lord president in relation to matters of this sort <e> <s> and once the sheriff courts also become involved in this matter i would expect that the sheriff principals experience will be extremely important <e>", "<cs> i would suggest to your lordships that the clause as drafted gives a sufficient protection for the rights of parliament in this matter <e> <s> the order would relate solely to the class or classes of undefended divorce actions in which corroboration may not be required <e> <s> it would not appear to me that affirmative resolution procedure is appropriate to that <e> <s> if any member of your lordships house or member of the other place had any doubt about the propriety of the order they could readily raise it under our provisions and i would hope that the lord advocate would be able to satisfy members of both houses without the necessity of taking up parliamentary time on it <e> <s> it appears to us that this sort of provision is in line with the general practice which your lordships house has followed in orders of this kind <e> <s> in the light of that explanation i would hope that the noble lord would feel able to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am glad to accept the congratulations with regard to a matter in another bill <e> <s> we considered all the representations including those made to us by the noble and learned lord and decided that it was right not to press that clause of that bill should apply to scotland <e> <s> that matter is still under discussion in another place so anything we say is entirely tentative <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord was waxing eloquent on his amendment i was beginning to wonder whether i was wrong to take the decision i referred to about clause of the other bill <e> <s> however in relation to criminal matters the noble and learned lord has referred to a fairly recent provision extending the law in this direction for routine evidence <e> <s> i feel it would not be right to go along with this proposal in relation to criminal matters at this stage <e>", "<cs> i understand that at least some of the illustrations given both here and in another place relate not necessarily to legal aid but to the ordinary methods by which these litigations are funded <e> <s> for example i am not sure whether the welcome addition to the income of the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey in was from her majestys government in another guise or from some private litigant <e> <s> but the problem also exists in private litigation <e>", "<cs> if i did not it is my fault <e> <s> the arrangements which my noble friend lord campbell of alloway referred to operating south of the border have been mirrored by arrangements north of the border in relation to payments on account in civil legal aid cases <e>", "<cs> concurrent jurisdiction is not a new phenomenon so far as scotland is concerned as we have heard and therefore the legal aid system has had to cope with this <e> <s> my understanding of the position is that where the matter which is the subject of a legal aid application is a matter where there is concurrent jurisdiction legally aided parties do not have a complete freedom of choice <e> <s> they have a right to apply in the case of the court of session to the appropriate legal aid committee for legal aid which is the supreme court committee but they cannot expect the supreme court committee to grant legal aid for a court of session action when it would be heard more cheaply conveniently and appropriately in the sheriff court <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> it had not escaped my right honourable friends attention that he has a certain ammunition of that character available <e>", "<cs> as regards the first part of this amendment its precise effect would depend on the nature of the arrangements that we discussed under the last amendment <e> <s> for example if the fee scale for a divorce in the court of session were the same as the fee scale for a divorce in the sheriff court i think that the particular problem to which this part of the amendment addresses itself would not arise <e> <s> if on the other hand it happens that it is more expensive to go to the court of session in a particular case this part of the amendment appears to be contemplating that the legal aid fund would be responsible for the part which is equal to the amount that one would pay in the sheriff court and the balance would be paid presumably out of the persons own pocket <e> <s> this is a kind of supplementation of the legal aid fund which has sometimes been described as topping up <e> <s> such topping up has been resisted by successive governments and is contrary to section of the legal aid scotland act <e>", "<cs> i hope that your lordships will agree that clause should stand part of the bill <e> <s> the ultimate result of the negotiations which the noble and learned lord has referred to as having begun it would be very imprudent for me to try to forecasti think that his second question arises only on the assumption that one has answered the first one in a certain way <e> <s> so i think that disposes of both his questions <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey for this suggestion and it is one which we will consider further in relation to the study of what can be done in the way of handing out precognitions <e> <s> one aspect of it is worthy of note and is new to me and that is involving the prosecutor in matters connected with the legal aid system <e> <s> so far that has not happened and my impression is that it would be undesirable but that is a minor part of this proposal <e> <s> i would certainly mean to have this in mind when we are studying further the possibility of handing out crown precognitions more generally <e> <s> on occasion it has happened that crown precognitions have been handed out but experience has not always been that the trial has thereby been greatly shortened but we are not particularly discouraged by that experience <e> <s> our intention is to consult on <e>", "<cs> it may be doubtful whether the proposed new clause comes within the scope of the bill but i should be happy to deal with it in the way i have suggested dealing with some similar matters and that is to bring it to the attention of the appropriate rule-making bodies <e> <s> i would think it perfectly competent to do already what the noble and learned lord is suggesting <e> <s> if he wished to suggest in a case he was in that instead of having the privilege of addressing the court it would be done on paper the court could do that <e> <s> i do not know whether he has tried and failed or whether this is his first suggestion of it here <e> <s> in any case i feel satisfied that it is the sort of suggestion that is best dealt with by the courts who have power to deal with it in this way already if they wish to and i shall bring it to their attention <e>", "<cs> with regard to this particular amendment i would suggest that the provision in the bill for negative procedure is appropriate <e> <s> the right of parliament to take cognisance of what the secretary of state is proposing and to take the final decision upon it is preserved by that procedure <e> <s> so far as the exercise of the power is concerned i do not think that i can add anything to what was said in the other place in relation to the intention <e> <s> the position is that the secretary of state is asking parliament for this power and he will not use it except in a situation in which when he adopts the negative procedure he is subject to parliamentary scrutiny <e> <s> i have no doubt that his proposals in relation to any particular change will be the subject of consultation before he proceeds <e> <s> i believe that it would not be right at the moment for me to try to forecast with any degree of precision what would be the result of the exercise of the power if parliament gives it to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> we have endeavoured to take account of the incidental business very important business that will be generated by the transfer to the sheriff court of a number of divorce actions <e> <s> as i say i do not think that there is anything further that we can do until the matter is really ready to start <e> <s> i do not see how this particular amendment could assist in that process <e> <s> the method of dealing <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is that the work of preparation is going ahead in the scottish office but has not yet been completed <e> <s> the scottish office is slightly behind the home office on this particular occasion <e> <s> i hope that the consultation paper will be issued fairly soon <e>", "<cs> that situation could only arise if the existing rates are low by reason of provisions that should not have been put in the covenants or leases in question <e> <s> this is giving to the tenants who have acquired their properties what they were entitled to under the act <e> <s> it is an effctive means of doing that <e>", "<cs> of course precisely what the appropriate covenants or terms of conveyances should be is a matter of circumstances <e> <s> but all that the governments proposal does is to give the people who bought what the act entitled them to get <e> <s> therefore anything that the noble baroness is saying about the impact of these matters is not a complaint against these powers it is a comment upon what parliament laid down in <e> <s> all that this is intended to do is to give effect to what parliament then provided <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady birk has explained that the purpose of this amendment to clause is to avoid a situation in which a local government officer would be presented with conflicting obligations between the wishes of his employer the local authority and the wishes of the secretary of state <e> <s> before speaking to the amendment itself however perhaps it would be useful if i sought to clarify the purpose of clause as a whole <e> <s> that clause builds upon a provision already contained in the act as the noble lord lord prys-davies has correctly said giving the secretary of state a power to require landlords to supply information <e>", "<cs> i of course noticed the noble lords question and i endeavoured to answer it <e> <s> i said there were two grounds on which the secretary of state considered it necessary to have this power <e> <s> the first is that he requires express power to require information prior to intervention in order that he may be able to decide on a better basis whether or not he should intervene <e> <s> the second ground is in order to enable him to understand the position with regard to covenants and conditions which have been imposed in conveyances or leases so that he may see whether these conform with the act <e> <s> that is the basis on which these powers are sought <e> <s> with all respect to the noble lord i venture to think that i answered his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this bill has <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the general thrust of the remarks of both the noble lord lord bruce of donington and the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> may i say that i am also grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd for intimating to me that he intended to speak notwithstanding that his name was not on the list <e> <s> of course i welcomed the knowledge that he was going to speak knowing that he would add to the distinction of this very short debate <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of marnock has made a number of general comments in relation to this particular amendment <e> <s> my view of the position is that roads legislation in scotland has been added to piecemeal over a long period <e> <s> the difficulty for the practitioner in finding out the relevant law has been quite remarkable <e> <s> the object of this bill is to try to bring together in one bill all the provisions which relate to roads and to make them consistent and reasonably clear and part of a single structure <e>", "<cs> i join with the noble lord in thinking that matters should be clear and plain <e> <s> i shall do everything possible to achieve that result <e> <s> the idea of the phrase in the brackets which the noble lord wishes to leave out is that it will be easily referred to later in the bill because time and again this concept comes up <e> <s> to set out the full description each time would make the bill a great deal longer rather than shorter <e> <s> this is a common technique and i suggest a simple plain technique <e> <s> in the light of that explanation i hope that the noble lord will feel that this is a reasonable way to go about it <e>", "<cs> i have to respectfully disagree about that <e> <s> as regards section or clause that is a different list <e> <s> that is the list kept by the secretary of state for scotland and that list is also referred to later <e> <s> that is the reason why it is mentioned <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i thought the noble lord was referring to clause <e> <s> so far as this is concerned it is the subject of an amendment <e> <s> the purpose of expressing it in this way in subsection is to make it clear that what this list is to be because one must start with this list and what subsection is requiring is that what is on the existing list at the date the bill comes into force will become the first list under the bill <e> <s> one needs therefore to pick up the existing situation the situation as it exists when this bill comes into force in order to put in for the first time the list which is required in the bill under subsection <e>", "<cs> the harmful consequences would be that one would have to repeat the description in full of this list of public roads every time it occurs in the bill and it occurs quite a number of times <e>", "<cs> that is certainly another possibility but it is not a question of leaving it out altogether it is putting it somewhere <e> <s> the noble lord lord hughes indicated on second reading as i recall that it seemed convenient to have interpretations at the beginning <e> <s> this is a matter which is fundamental to the way the bill is constructed <e> <s> it seems very easy to slip in the reference point right at the beginning <e> <s> i submit to your lordships that it is a very convenient way in this context of achieving a fairly clear result <e>", "<cs> the structure of this clause is that the roads authority is given the responsibility of management and maintenace <e> <s> the purpose of the provisions to which the noble lord has drawn attention is to give an explanation by way of illustration although not exhaustively of what that management and maintenance is to consist of <e> <s> in my judgment <e> <s> the phraseology employed is of the type that is perfectly common in similar acts of parliament <e> <s> to take out the words in the manner that the noble lord suggests would restrict the powers of the roads authority to the particular examples given <e> <s> that would be to narrow the powers from what they are at present <e> <s> i hope that that clarification is sufficient for the noble lords purposes <e>", "<cs> at the moment we are strictly speaking on amendment no <e> <s> although we shall perhaps have the great pleasure of considering amendment no <e> <s> in a little while <e> <s> it may be wise to have amendment no <e> <s> in mind when considering suggestions on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the principle obligation is to manage and maintain the road <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i have given such explanation as i think is appropriate for this <e> <s> the most doubtful question i think that the noble lord has asked me is in relation to the word renew <e> <s> if you are renewing a road is that an alteration of the road <e> <s> it would certainly be open to argument whether that was so because <e> <s> in effect if you are renewing it all that you are doing is putting down what was there before but it is new and that may be regarded as the same road new <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is anxious to tell me the answer <e> <s> i am trying to give him my answer but i know that he sees the situation perhaps a little differently from the way in which i do <e> <s> however i think he will take it from me that i have had occasion from time to time to involve myself with the detailed consideration of acts of parliament in relation to particular cases <e> <s> i am saying and this is all i said at the time that he asked me to make way for him that the most doubtful question that he asked me was whether renew would be included in alter <e> <s> of course i perfectly understand that if one repairs a road one uses new materials to fill in the holes and so on <e> <s> but it might be very questionable whether a repair of a road was an alteration of a road <e> <s> so the mere fact <e> <s> as he said that one is using new materials necessarily involves one in making an alteration of the road <e>", "<cs> i am extremely happy to give an undertaking of that type <e> <s> i will examine all that has been said on this matter to see whether we can improve the provisions <e> <s> i think that i said that before and if it helps the noble lord i am perfectly happy to say it again <e> <s> it would be my intention in any case in a matter of this type and with a bill of this type to take account of everything that your lordships say and to see whether we can make use of it to improve the wording of the bill <e> <s> i am much obliged to the noble lord for what he has had to say about it <e> <s> i shall also take his advice about the more i speak the less it seems to do me good and so i shall now be silent <e>", "<cs> yes certainly i will be happy to do that in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> yes i am much obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i have sought to explain that the idea of putting this power in clause is to facilitate the alteration of the type of use of a public road with cyclists and the alterations in order to provide for them very much in mind <e> <s> it seems an appropriate place in which this particular power should be given <e> <s> the mechanisms under which the power can be exercised of course are subject to later controls <e> <s> i mentioned amendment no <e> <s> which deals with that in particular <e>", "<cs> on the particular matter of amendment no <e> <s> the specific point i want to add by way of this amendment is <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his frankness <e> <s> it has not been my experience generally that when i have been invited to give my views i have confused the people who have asked me to give them but one is always learning as one goes on and of course it may depend to some extent on the person to whom the views are being communicated <e>", "<cs> indeed but i am talking about myself on this particular occasion <e> <s> so far as the occasions to which the noble lords history relates of <e>", "<cs> the wording of the amendment is <e>", "<cs> my lords the words which this amendment seeks to remove distinguish between one local roads authoritys list and anothers as well as between the list prepared by a local roads authority and that prepared under clause by the secretary of state <e> <s> in my view and i commend this view to the committee the words are necessary to the interpretation of the clause and should remain <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will feel able to accept that point of view <e>", "<cs> when this bill comes into effect the provisions of clause will come into effect and there is a provision there for a list to be prepared <e> <s> clause is stating what is to be in the first list and what is to be in the first list is what is in the existing lists <e> <s> the existing lists are prepared under the statutes which are to be repealed on this statute coming into operation <e> <s> there are more of them than just the roads and bridges scotland act <e> <s> your lordships will see that the register of streets under section of the burgh police scotland act is also taken in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hughes is with respect doing something of an injustice to those officials because the statutory authority under which they keep the list is the act of so far as roads and bridges are concerned and the burgh police scotland act so far as streets are concerned <e> <s> that is the authority under which they <e>", "<cs> the reason for putting in the words free of charge is to make it absolutely plain on the face of the act that this is the position <e> <s> if the words were left out the result might well be that there would be no authority to charge but one would have to reach that conclusion by that reasoning whereas when the face of the bill says free of charge the ordinary person not familiar with all the principles of statutory construction will see plainly that this is the position <e> <s> that is why the words are there <e>", "<cs> i renew my motion that this amendment be agreed to <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord hughes for the way in which he has approached this matter <e> <s> i certainly accept that the problems of drafting and how best to express matters as complicated as the fundamental concepts we are dealing with here are matters that require time and it is useful to have the kind of exchange that we have just had <e> <s> so far as the amendment no <e> <s> is concerned the reason for having the word abutting in is that it takes account of situations in which a property could not be said to have its front on a street because it is a much shorter boundary that is to the street than perhaps the other boundaries of the property <e> <s> you might say that it is end on to the road or street <e> <s> that is the reason for abutting and fronting <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i certainly accept that the words is made come in what might be regarded as an unusual place <e> <s> but the problem is that if one puts them in the more usual place which is the place the noble lord suggests in his amendment it is difficult to he certain that the within days affects the is made rather than the consideration <e> <s> as amended it says that they <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to disappoint the noble lord quite so early hut there may be other times yet <e> <s> the situation really so far as i am concerned is this <e> <s> i should think it unlikely that anyone coming to this bill would think that clear used in the interpretation clause had the meaning which the noble lord has assigned to it <e> <s> i think such a person would understand it in some other way as sunny or not raining or whatever <e> <s> the phrase clear days has been used in statutory definitions to have the same sense as full days whole days for some considerable time as long ago as to go back and as modern as to come forward <e> <s> so i think that the phrase clear days is one which has stood the test of time <e> <s> the meaning in my submission is reasonably clear <e> <s> i hope that in the light of that explanation the noble lord may feel able to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i understand that the noble lord does not wish to delete the right of appeal <e>", "<cs> he wishes to change the way in which it is expressed <e> <s> clause sets out the right <e> <s> it cannot be explained all at once therefore we have to put in something which refers to the number <e> <s> however i concede that it might be an improvement to put subsection after subsection which would necessitate the renumbering of the subsections <e> <s> i am happy to consider that suggestion <e> <s> it is not covered exactly by either of the two amendments but i am happy to consider it for the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> the necessity for the words which the noble lord seeks to delete is to indicate what the powers of the sheriff are on an application <e> <s> if this provision is not included there is no clear specification of the powers of the sheriff on a reference being made to him <e> <s> this therefore serves the dual purpose of the phrase which the noble lord seeks to put in its place <e> <s> it also serves to define what decision the sheriff is empowered to take <e> <s> in the light of that explanation i hope the noble lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> in my view it is wise to have these words in the bill in order to define the powers of the sheriff on the reference of this matter to him <e>", "<cs> the situation is that the road includes the bridge generally speaking <e> <s> but there may be situations in which the maintenance of the bridge and of the road are not in the same responsibility <e> <s> let me give one illustration <e> <s> the bridges which cross the caledonian canal are required to be maintained by the caledonian canal authority whereas the road which crosses the bridge is maintained by the roads authority <e> <s> of course what happens is that they apportion the responsibility for the whole thing between them <e> <s> but one has to distinguish between these and one has to be careful not to put on the roads authority the whole responsibility for maintaining a bridge just because the road goes across the bridge <e> <s> with that explanation i hope the noble lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> it would depend upon the circumstances but one would think there would certainly be a very good case <e>", "<cs> i am going to surprise the noble lord <e> <s> i am very happy to accept this amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to him for moving it <e> <s> it is an improvement <e>", "<cs> equally i accept it <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord says most of the amendments are concerned with no deep matter of policy but with just the phraseology in which these particular provisions are expressed <e> <s> the purpose of using the phrase for the time being is precisely to emphasise the need to keep these lists up to date <e> <s> in fact at the moment the secretary of state does have some obligation in this matter but not in primary legislation <e> <s> if we are to have a primary legislation responsibility to keep a list it is very important that it should be a list which is up to date <e> <s> it is in order to emphasise that that the phrase for the time being is being incorporated <e>", "<cs> that is precisely the purpose of these words to put that duty on the secretary of state and the secretary of state will have a responsibility to see that the arrangements which he makes through his officials have the effect that the noble lord says <e> <s> i agree with him that it is frustrating to go to one of these registers and find that they are out of date <e> <s> it is misleading <e> <s> the purpose of this is to ensure that the secretary of state will have the responsibility and it will be his job to see that it is efficiently carried out <e> <s> i am much obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> we have no evidence that excessive use is made of such lists as have to be kept at the moment <e> <s> the secretary of state is taking this responsibility and it seems right that the lists should be available for inspection free of charge <e> <s> regarding the places that they are kept the secretary of state will keep his lists at the secretary of states office which would normally be i think at new st andrews house or where the roads division office is <e> <s> the local roads authorities have responsibilities and they will keep the lists at the appropriate offices of the local roads authority <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for making the purpose of these two amendments so clear <e> <s> the answer is that an advance made under this power would free the local authority altogether from the burden of this particular payment <e> <s> the purpose of the particular provision is to make it clear that this power is to be used only when the secretary of state thinks that is the way it should be <e> <s> it comes exactly from the local government scotland act when this power was introduced and the noble lord will perhaps know more about that than i do <e> <s> this is not changing the existing law it is merely continuing the conditions under which under the existing law these advances may be made <e> <s> i hope this answers the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining his amendment so clearly <e> <s> i sympathise entirely with the difficulty of making such a clear amendment under the mechanisms we have to use which sometimes make simplicity look complicated <e> <s> i understand exactly the result he wishes to achieve <e> <s> there is however a problem which also enables me to answer the amendment in the way he suggested by explaining why we have done it this way <e>", "<cs> as i understand the position the only way the noble lord is able to simplify by changing the order is by obscuring the distinction between paragraphs <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend indicated ultimately he realised that the amendment did not cover his point which was why i did not mention it especially <e> <s> i am very happy to look into the matter to see whether anything can be done to deal with the difficulty that my noble friend has experienced <e>", "<cs> i believe the words in the existing legislation are necessary in the sense that it may be possible <e> <s> when somebody else is constructing a road to make an advance of money which in the opinion of the secretary of state and the local authority will provide public benefit more than just to the particular person who is constructing the road a private landowner for example or an industrialist who may construct a road to his factory <e> <s> by putting out a little extra money public benefit may be obtained and it is the power to do that which is here in question <e> <s> i do not think it is exercised very often but i believe it is an important power to have in such circumstances <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will feel satisfied with that explanation <e>", "<cs> among other things the purpose of this bill is to try to deal with claims and a public road will be a road on the appropriate list now unless it is a special road <e> <s> the conditions under which it goes on the list are set out <e> <s> what used to be called taken over and i will come to this later is now to be clarified as going on the list with consequences <e> <s> the mere fact that an advance is given does not necessarily mean that the resulting road will go on the list <e> <s> it will still enable a public benefit to be conferred if the secretary of state decides to make such an advance but he would not make such an advance lightly to any other person <e> <s> these are the circumstances which might apply but it would not necessarily mean that the road when constructed or the improvement that is being made when made would make the road a public road in the sense of its going on the list of roads to be maintained by either a local roads authority or the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> the purpose of including this word is to make it a little more flexible than incidental <e> <s> powers to spend money of this sort are apt to be fairly strictly construed <e> <s> the word incidental is a word which is often used in this connection <e> <s> for example things like geotechnical surveys to see whether a road is feasible in a particular position might not be regarded as incidental to the road because you might not ultimately make the road at all <e> <s> it is necessary to have fairly wide powers in this connection and we felt that the word conducive was an appropriate word to connote some width in this respect <e> <s> landscaping is another possible head which might not be regarded as strictly incidental to the purposes of the road itself although very conducive to having a nice road when it is finished <e>", "<cs> the first answer is that this is the phrase that we have already <e> <s> this is in the existing legislation and we are trying to deal with that <e> <s> the second point i think is that the phrase accruing due means more than just accruing because the theory is that if you have interest on a loan it is accruing from day to day but usually the loan requires actual payments to be made on particular dates <e>", "<cs> i am not certain the noble lord will necessarily achieve simplification that way <e> <s> perhaps he will look at it again <e>", "<cs> perhaps for varietys sake i should say that it appears to me that the present wording is one way in which this could be expressed and the amendment puts it in another way <e> <s> both ways are perfectly plain ways of expressing the same idea but it so happens the noble lord will not be surprised to hear that this phrase is in the legislation that we are seeking to codify <e> <s> it has been used in section of the development and road improvement funds act so it has been around for a while and that is why we have preferred this particular method <e> <s> the result is exactly the same <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to accept this amendment <e> <s> may i suggest to the noble lord that a similar passage occurs in clause on page <e> <s> perhaps he might feel able on the next occasion to put down a corresponding amendment <e>", "<cs> as your lordships will appreciate when it is decided that what is a trunk road should cease to be a trunk road a lot of people have to have their interests considered and there is an elaborate procedure for that purpose <e> <s> the purpose of <e>", "<cs> i am extremely happy to accept this amendment and i should be very glad if the noble lord would move it in the form of the second alternative that he used if they think fit <e> <s> if your lordships are prepared to accept the amendment in that form i am happy to accept it like that for the reasons which the noble lord has given <e> <s> i hope that this is a good spirit in which to come to the dinner adjournment <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient to say something which bears upon a number of the other amendments which the noble lord has tabled <e> <s> as the noble lord will appreciate the special roads act created the power to make roads which were called special roads <e> <s> they have two main features <e> <s> the first is that the public utilities street works act does not apply <e> <s> in other words there is no right for public utility undertakings to put works in <e> <s> the other special feature is that the classes of traffic may be readily regulated <e> <s> as the noble lord knows the principal examples of this type of road are motorways <e> <s> it is important that the roads authority should have a strong right to prevent people from putting equipment in <e>", "<cs> they will continue to be named special roads <e> <s> normally they will be roads with a very high designation <e> <s> the edinburgh outer by-pass is another example of a special road <e> <s> this is a matter of history <e> <s> the special roads act came first <e> <s> the motorways were created under that act <e> <s> people called them motorways but they were examples of special roads <e> <s> it might have been possible to change the system and to describe them as motorways but that would have required a great deal of change <e> <s> we felt that it would be best to incorporate the existing statutory provisions into this bill and to use as the simplest form of continuation the designation which had previously been used <e>", "<cs> the situation is that up to the time of this bill the special road was provided under the special roads act <e> <s> motorways are the principal examples but not the only examples of roads which might he constructed under these powers <e> <s> a feature of the roads which have been referred to is that you can lay down the classes of traffic which may use them <e> <s> pedestrians can be excluded for example <e> <s> the other important point is that the public utilities street works code does not apply <e> <s> therefore there is a much stronger right for the road authority to prevent the road being dug up for the sake of public utilities <e> <s> these are the features of the special road and that legislation <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has misunderstood and i am sure that is my fault <e> <s> an m road is simply one class of special road <e> <s> the main example of a special road is what has been called a motorway <e> <s> motorways were constructed under the special roads acts powers and they are the principal examples <e> <s> the special roads on which the noble lord will have travelled will almost all have been motorways <e> <s> but the edinburgh outer by-pass is another example <e> <s> strictly speaking it is not a motorway and it does not conform with all that is required of a road to be classified as a motorway <e> <s> but it is a special road <e> <s> it has the features that the traffic on it is restricted to particular classes and that the public utility street works code does not apply to it <e>", "<cs> that is true so far as the traffics use of the road is concerned but the traffic which may use the road can vary according to what the secretary of state thinks appropriate <e>", "<cs> the number of these roads is sufficiently small to make it unwise to make more numerous statutory provisions than are necessary <e> <s> so far as road construction is concerned and special provisions of that kind there is no distinction between a special road and a motorway from the point of view of relevance under this legislation <e> <s> so far as i can judge what we have done is the most appropriate action in the circumstances and i hope that my noble friend is able to agree with that explanation <e>", "<cs> this is just to provide the definition of the special roads authority as being the roads authority responsible for these particular special roads <e> <s> it may be the local roads authority or it may be the secretary of state <e> <s> in the case of the motorways it is the secretary of state because sometimes local authorities act as agents for him in a particular area indeed very often they do <e> <s> but the roads authority for most of the motorways indeed i believe all the motorways is the secretary of state <e> <s> that is the reason for this subsection <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this clause is to give the secretary of state power to classify a road as among other things a principal road <e> <s> i am not sure that anything more is required <e> <s> it is for the secretary of state to decide whether he calls a road a principal road <e> <s> the classification is that which the secretary of state decides should be assigned to the road <e> <s> the purpose of the clause is to give proper power to make such classification both in relation of the provisions of this bill and to those of any other enactment which refers to a road classified by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i think the distinction is that the principal road is a type of classification and if the secretary of state exercises his power to classify it as a principal road it will be that for the secretary of state and for all of us <e>", "<cs> one of the consequences of classification may be the way in which the road falls to be maintained <e> <s> that is one of <e>", "<cs> like most of the provisions of this bill the main function is to regulate the provision of the road rather than the traffic on the road <e> <s> the road traffic regulation act is the one that deals with the use of the road by traffic <e> <s> the principle purpose of this legislation is to deal with the construction the financial arrangements for the construction and for the maintenance and so on <e>", "<cs> i sought to explain that <e> <s> the distinction between a public road and private road is that the public authority has a duty to maintain the public road <e> <s> any other public right of way is a private road <e> <s> this clause is dealing with the classification of roads which is a different matter and may have a bearing on the financial arrangements made between the secretary of state himself and local authorities for the maintenance of the road <e> <s> it is not a distinction of the same kind as the distinction between public and private <e>", "<cs> the answer is that a main road may be a principal road if it is classified as such by the secretary of state <e> <s> so far as i can see the principal function of that classification is to affect the burden of maintenance <e> <s> the secretary of state may pay different grants in respect of different classifications of roads and this clause gives him the power that enables him to do that <e> <s> it is a different type of distinction from the other distinctions to which the noble lord has referred <e>", "<cs> certainly i will look at it <e> <s> i have sought to explain the situation <e> <s> but i will read what the noble lord has said and look at it again in the light of that <e>", "<cs> this clause is designed to deal with the situation in which the authority is faced with a private road and in which there is a question of making it into a public road <e> <s> the general situation is that under clause the local roads authority may by notice to the frontagers of a private road require them to make it up and to maintain it at such reasonable standard as may be specified in the notice <e> <s> there are provisions about appeals <e>", "<cs> i am obliged for that clear explanation <e> <s> my way of looking at this is that i think the word frontager appears only in clauses and <e> <s> in that situation and it is a matter of judgment it is not usual to have it in the interpretation clause unless the word occurs more often <e> <s> it is a perfectly acceptable practice where a word is used only sparingly to put the interpretation in close proximity to it <e>", "<cs> the existing legislation dealing with this point allows an appeal to the sheriff <e> <s> it was a fairly narrow balance as to whether sheriff should be left or whether secretary of state should be substituted <e> <s> the view was taken that if the secretary of state was the appellate tribunal it might lead to greater uniformity <e> <s> the balance is extremely narrow <e> <s> in view of the argument put forward by the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove and the feeling that he has expressed on the matter i feel disposed to accept this amendment and the following one <e>", "<cs> the appeal provision is in relation to the notice which is served under subsection that is the appeal provision in subsection <e> <s> subsection states that the notice shall <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord carmichael has explained that the purpose of the amendment is not really to delete this part of the bill but to inquire into our more detailed thinking about it <e> <s> as the noble lord said a power of this kind is extremely important in order to prevent the kind of serious difficulty to which he referred where people have purchased houses and are possibly living in the houses but the roads are never made up even when there is an obligation in the missive to make them up because the developer has gone bankrupt or something else of that nature has happened <e> <s> that is a serious risk <e> <s> these provisions are intended to provide for regulations whereby the risk may be obviated <e>", "<cs> i think the situation is that the provision to which the noble lord has referred in clause is one that does define the penalty <e> <s> the provision in clause does not fully define the penalty <e> <s> it only makes available the two modes of trial either summarily or on indictment <e> <s> then the situation is provided for in schedule under the head penalties for offences that on summary conviction it will be the statutory maximum and upon conviction on indictment a fine <e> <s> so the extra words that he is looking for so far as clause is concerned are provided by schedule <e> <s> there might be something to be said for doing the same so far as the clause which we have just been looking at is concerned and i shall certainly be happy to consider that <e>", "<cs> i am certainly under the strong impression that there is such a word and your lordships house has certainly passed a considerable amount of legislation in which that word has been used <e> <s> if it did not exist before it certainly exists by now <e>", "<cs> the word requisite is the word that has been chosen <e> <s> i think it is a common word <e> <s> it may not be quite so common in the circles in which the noble lord moves as the word necessary but it is a perfectly common word and is well understood <e> <s> the fact is and this is the second reason it is the word which has been used in the corresponding section of the roads and bridges scotland act since <e> <s> i could well see that if the noble lord was drafting the bill he might have chosen necessary and i would not feel able to press for requisite as an alternative <e> <s> but having chosen requisite perhaps the noble lord will allow us to retain it <e>", "<cs> we are anxious naturally to reduce the volume of the legislation consistent with clarity <e> <s> but it is important that the right to be heard is a right to be heard by the roads authority and nobody else not a deputation or an official of the roads authority <e> <s> it is a right to be heard by the roads authority and i regard that as important <e> <s> the fact that the bill says as regards his application is possibly wise having regard to how far in advance the phrase is used <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the phrase which is attacked in the amendment is to make it clear that the clause includes powers to change the banking or camber of a road as well as raising or lowering the full level of the road as a whole <e> <s> this is based on a modern provision the roads scotland act <e> <s> the danger is that if one misses this out at this stage comparison might be made with the previous fairly modern legislation and it might be thought that the intention was somewhat to restrict the power of the road authority <e>", "<cs> this legislation has been in place for some time <e> <s> these words as i have said were in the roads scotland act and no such difficult consequences have arisen <e> <s> it seems to me a reasonable provision and local authorities are given powers to use reasonably <e> <s> the courts certainly would be prepared to curb unreasonable use of statutory powers <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that my noble friend feels he is not getting full consideration <e> <s> i am giving the fullest consideration to every suggestion <e> <s> the mere fact that something was in a previous act does not in any way tie our hands but where the choice between two sets of words is a very narrow one then i feel that the fact that it was in previous legislation is of some importance <e> <s> it was in that light that i used that expression <e> <s> this particular expression is used in what i said was a modern statute the roads scotland act <e> <s> the more modern the statute the less necessary it is to change for the sake of modernisation but we are engaged in the exercise of trying to simplify the whole of our roads legislation <e> <s> it is quite a big task but i am not ruling out anything <e> <s> i think i have made it clear that i will consider all matters that have been raised and this is no exception <e>", "<cs> this clause has its origins in the road traffic act and is primarily aimed at pedestrian safety <e> <s> a footway as defined in clause is that element of a road which is associated with a carriageway and whose provision enables pedestrians to keep out of the way of traffic <e> <s> footpaths are places for pedestrians which are not associated with carriageways <e> <s> while it is not appropriate to extend the duties of road authorities under this clause to footpaths these authorities will still be able to construct footpaths where they consider them to be requisite under their powers in clause of the bill <e> <s> i would have thought with great respect that to insert footpaths here is inappropriate <e> <s> footways are the correct provision for pedestrians in association with the public road <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord says what he is going to do about this amendment may i say that the important point is that we are talking about public roads and a footpath by definition and we have tried to define these for consistency is a place for pedestrians <e> <s> it is as it were by itself and is not associated with anything else <e> <s> it is not appropriate to put it in here because it is not for a public road <e> <s> in the case of a footpath the footpath is the public road <e>", "<cs> we are absolutely at one about what is wanted here <e> <s> the only question is whether there should be some restriction on the distance from the road that one should go <e> <s> what we have provided is that the roads authority should be allowed to go as far as may be necessary from the road to provide the necessary protection <e> <s> for example to provide effective protection from flooding or landslide works may have to be carried out at a considerable <e>", "<cs> the earlier words are permissive enabling a local authority to provide these various facilities <e> <s> it is very important that the roads authority should have a duty to cleanse and keep open any road drains which are provided by them <e> <s> the noble lords amendment would remove that duty <e> <s> we regard that duty as important <e> <s> therefore we feel that the provision should remain <e> <s> this is the distinction between permissive and mandatory to which the noble lord lord hughes has already referred <e> <s> we are trying to make the position absolutely plain <e> <s> we regard it as important to have both aspects in the clause <e>", "<cs> that is so under this clause <e>", "<cs> with great respect it does not in any way knock out our power to scour all sorts of drains we then have a duty to scour our own drains <e> <s> there is no conflict between the two <e>", "<cs> i accept that there is a point here <e> <s> the words proposed by the noble lord lord hughes may not exactly fit this context either but if he will leave this matter with me we shall bring back an amendment at report stage to cover this <e>", "<cs> there is a point here of some importance <e> <s> it is desirable that the authority with the power to close these gates should have the power to do so not in relation only to a danger which has already been created but which that authority anticipates may arise in the immediate future <e> <s> the clause as drafted is not very satisfactory and i am obliged to the noble lord for moving this amendment as it has drawn my attention particulary to the drafting of the clause <e>", "<cs> this clause as it stands provides that <e>", "<cs> as i understand my noble friends example that sort of footpath will come within the obligation but it will also in the light of the example have a public right of way over it <e> <s> when i say <e>", "<cs> in so far as snow and ice constitute dirt which i suppose is matter out of place or something of that kind the district has a duty to take proper steps to remove it <e> <s> that is a duty which obviously cannot be performed at the same rate in every situation <e> <s> it might take a long time fully to remove all the dirt <e> <s> the cleansing function is on the district or islands authority but where there is snow and ice in question and as i say there may be an overlap here the obligation to take reasonable steps to prevent them from constituting a danger is on the roads authority <e> <s> that is in accordance with the recommendations of the committee presided over by my noble friend lord stodart of leaston <e> <s> as i said earlier that does not necessarily mean that the snow and ice will be removed <e> <s> it may add to the dirt by putting on grit and so on <e> <s> i should not like to attempt to analyse the point at which the obligation passes from one authority to the other <e> <s> both obligations can exist together <e> <s> that is the position that we have adopted <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the noble earl in relation to the importance of signposting <e> <s> however i earlier sought to explain that the bill is concerned more with the construction of roads and the financial arrangements in regard to that as well as the responsibilities of the road authorities regarding construction maintenance and so on than with management <e>", "<cs> there is no appeal provision or anything of that sort <e> <s> it might be going too far to say there are no circumstances in which it might be possible to challenge a decision of a local authority in court an entirely unreasonable decision exercised under statutory powers might be challengeable <e> <s> that is not necessary to provide it is already there under the general law <e> <s> but it is thought that this is a matter which can reasonably be left to the wise judgment of the local authority <e>", "<cs> my recollection is that the power to impose the mph speed limit is related generally to lighting but i do not think it is absolutely so <e> <s> i would need to look into that more fully <e>", "<cs> your lordships are aware that the secretary of state would require to make regulations in relation to the authorisation of road humps and to their construction and maintenance <e> <s> the regulations which are presently in place in england and wales provide requirements as to lighting location and spacing of the humps <e> <s> they also require there to be on the road leading to the hump and near to it at least one obstacle such as a bend or junction which will have the effect of reducing traffic speeds <e> <s> it would be the secretary of states intention that equally rigid regulations would be applied in scotland and it is obvious that in considering these regulations he would want to take account of as full a view as he could have of what was appropriate <e>", "<cs> the reason for inserting reference to the court of session is that these cattle-grids might come at the boundaries of estates and the boundaries of estates sometimes come at the boundaries of sheriffdoms <e> <s> to have the grid exactly on the boundary of a sheriffdom means that there is no particular sheriff court to apply to <e> <s> it is to cover that possibility that the court of session is involved <e> <s> there is no problem in going to a sheriffs court which is where you would normally go if the sheriff is available <e> <s> it is only in that event that one would think of going to the court of session and in these circumstances it seems reasonable <e>", "<cs> we do not need to provide that because that would he the practical way in which it would operate <e> <s> nobody would go to the court of session if he could go to the sheriff in the ordinary circumstances <e> <s> that is the practical way in which it would happen <e>", "<cs> our approach to this matter is that local authorities should not be in the hot-dog and coffee stall business <e> <s> no doubt some of them are capable of providing very good hot-dogs and very good cups of coffee but we do not consider that that is what they were elected to do <e> <s> this is a field <e>", "<cs> subject to the appropriateness of the context <e> <s> sometimes it is not absolutely clear that it would be right to do so but i shall certainly look at that point <e>", "<cs> it would of course be desirable if one could do it to make the word road prevail completely but the phrase street works code to which the noble lord has referred comes within the public utilities street works act and we cannot really amend the title of that act <e> <s> the code comes from that act and therefore i would suggest that it is appropriate to leave that phrase as it stands <e>", "<cs> my impression is that the situation to which the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove referred is covered but since it is a particular case i should like to look at it in more detail and deal with it later <e>", "<cs> clause makes it an offence to cause an obstruction except with the consent in writing of the road authority and there is no question of the road authority consenting to something that constitutes an obstruction <e> <s> anyone who contravenes that clause commits an offence <e> <s> the situation would be that if a contractor or employee or someone of that sort deposited something on the verge and created an obstruction that person would be committing an offence unless he did so with the authority in writing of the road authority and there would be no question of that <e>", "<cs> the situation is that if it is done without the consent of the road authority an offence is committed <e> <s> if a danger is created by the actions of the road authority that would certainly be actionable <e> <s> but the main sanction is a direct one <e> <s> it is a criminal offence if a person puts an obstruction on the verge without the consent in writing of the road authority <e>", "<cs> i think that the provisions that particularly relate to the obstruction that my noble friend has in mind are adequately covered by clauses to <e> <s> but i shall certainly look again at the matter in the light of what he has said <e> <s> however that is my impression having looked at his amendment and the bill <e>", "<cs> i am happy to accept this amendment as an improvement <e> <s> a minor qualification is that the word animal that remains at the end of line on page should be plural <e> <s> if that can be done by manuscript amendment i am happy with what is proposed <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i cannot accept this amendment as an improvement although i have had a good deal of discussion with the draftsmen about it <e> <s> the difficulty is that the word following comes a good deal before the things that are supposed to follow it and are being referred to <e> <s> we shall certainly look again to see whether the clause can be improved on the lines suggested because i can see that there is possible scope for improvement but i do not think that the amendment quite meets the point <e>", "<cs> the intention is to deal with openings which are within the road boundary <e> <s> the amendment i think would have the effect of obliging owners or occupiers to keep in order entrances to vaults arches <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the intention behind the amendments which have been moved by my noble friend <e> <s> clause of the bill already provides for seizure and detention by the roads authority of any animal which is left on or strays on to a public road unless that road runs through unenclosed countyside <e> <s> i doubt whether my noble friend intended the amendment to apply in an area such as that <e> <s> clause covers the situation where an animal is at large on the road with nobody being in charge of it <e> <s> if an owner were so imprudent as to put a horse or cattle in charge of someone who was not able to exercise effective control he might well lay himself open to a charge under the common law <e> <s> i am aware that clause does not include an offence provision but it provides for the authority to recover from the owner its expenses in seizing and detaining the animal <e> <s> and administrative costs being what they are the sums involved and consequently the degree of deterrence are likely to be much greater than the fine proposed in the noble lords second amendment <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the point which the noble lord is making but there is a substantial difference between what he has proposed and what we have proposed and i shall try to explain that difference briefly <e> <s> if the noble lord will refer to clause <e>", "<cs> i beg to move amendments nos <e> <s> b ca and d <e>", "<cs> the first thing i would like to say is that we regard clearly as including the kind of considerations the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> if a skip is clearly marked with the owners name that means that it is clear to those who look at it what the owners name is and therefore i would suggest that legibly does not really add anything to this provision <e> <s> i have had a look at the dictionaries and i think they confirm my earlier impression that that would be the situation there is a good deal of common ground between clearly and legibly <e>", "<cs> i shall draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state the remarks of the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> i have no doubt that such considerations are taken into account <e> <s> we are doing what we can to make sure that the arrangements for distribution of the powers are as economical as possible <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why my noble friend lord stodart of leaston was asked to chair a committee to examine these matters <e>", "<cs> noble lords opposite can certainly take it that the lord advocate is always grateful to them for all the help they can give <e> <s> i appreciate the spirit in which the amendments are moved <e> <s> i appreciate the elegance of the noble lords drafting but the difficulty is that if the drafting in amendments nos <e> <s> and is given effect to there is no connection necessarily between the projection and the building <e> <s> the responsibilities accrue according to the building which is owned or occupied <e> <s> therefore i think it is necessary to specify some connection between the building and the projection which is the source of the trouble <e>", "<cs> but what is specified in the notice must be a projection from the particular building <e> <s> it is that concept the connection between the projection and the building which is required as the basic power apart altogether from the notice which the noble lords amendment does not leave clearly in the clause <e>", "<cs> i certainly take the point that the noble lord lord ross of marnock and my noble friend lord selkirk have made that it behoves authorities which have powers to keep other people in order to make quite certain that their own parks trees and shrubs are in proper order <e> <s> i have no doubt that if they failed in their duty to see to that they would certainly lay themselves open to questions at common law if damage resulted <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has said subsection of the clause contains a fairly wide power <e> <s> it is essentially a power to provide for road safety and i think all your lordships would agree it is most important that land adjacent to a road in particular unfenced land is maintained so as to avoid danger being caused on it to road users <e>", "<cs> most certainly i can see the force of substituting for the word may the word shall as proposed in my noble friends amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not think that in its practical effect it would make a substantial difference at all because the roads authority of course are the persons who have in the first case to form the opinion that there is a danger <e> <s> when you are in this situation where it is a matter of first forming an opinion and then giving them power to take action it seems appropriate that it should be a power to take action rather than a matter requiring an expression such as shall <e> <s> i do not think that there is much difference in effect between the two in this context <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that this power is an extremely important one and that where the roads authority have a power of this kind there will be an implied duty to exercise it where danger actually exists <e>", "<cs> i understand the noble lords aversion to the word thing if a better word can be found <e> <s> unfortunately i doubt whether the word barrier is appropriate here because it has to cover all the matters i almost said things that are mentioned in subsection <e> <s> the noble lord will see reference to a wall or window-sill <e> <s> it would be inappropriate to describe a window-sill as a barrier <e> <s> therefore the word barrier does not seem appropriate <e>", "<cs> when we considered this before i said i would look at the matter carefully and as i remarked a few minutes ago we have not completed our consideration <e> <s> my noble friend will perhaps allow me some further time for consideration <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the noble lord has suggested an improvement and he has kindly allowed me time to consider it and i would like to do that <e> <s> but at first sight it would seem to be an improvement and i am most grateful to the noble lord for raising the point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has kindly given me considerably longer than that to consider the matter because i saw the amendment shortly after he put it down <e> <s> it seems to me with respect to be an extremely good suggestion and i am very happy to accept it <e>", "<cs> i have certainly considered the matter <e> <s> whatever might be described as a slogan is fairly well covered by the provision that we already have in the bill and of course if one were to make a collection of letters an offence one might be slightly complicating the matter <e> <s> if each sign or mark constitutes an offence it would probably be safer <e> <s> so in this situation i would prefer to leave the drafting as it is and i hope that the noble lord will perhaps on reconsideration feel able to agree with me <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for moving this manuscript amendment <e> <s> he earlier put forward the idea that not only damage to the road should be taken into account but also danger to traffic on the road <e> <s> it was fairly apparent that he had in mind the kind of danger that comes from fire adjoining the road <e> <s> that led on to thinking that that kind of danger can arise not only when someone starts the fire within metres of the road but when someone starts a fire further from the road and it burns towards the road <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord for moving this amendment which seems to cover that concept very fully <e>", "<cs> again in our view this is an improvement which noble lords have suggested and i am very grateful to them for bringing this amendment forward <e> <s> i am happy to advise that the amendment should be accepted <e>", "<cs> certainly i will be happy to look at the matter <e> <s> my first instinct would be to say that they probably are covered but i would like to look at the matter <e>", "<cs> i respectfully agree with the noble lord that the addition of the words or improving is an improvement and i am happy to recommend acceptance of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am always delighted to help the noble lord <e> <s> the only reason i prefer this amendment is that it happened to come first <e> <s> we tabled this amendment and the noble lord tabled his <e> <s> if i had known of the noble lords amendment before we tabled this amendment i should have been perfectly content with his <e>", "<cs> i should not like to suggest that there is anything mythical about it <e> <s> it seems to be a sensible suggestion <e> <s> however just at this moment i should not like to give chapter and verse for it <e>", "<cs> of course the general structure of the bill suggests that it would not be right for example to put such materials in a place where they obstructed the road and so on <e> <s> this particular provision in which the amendment is proposed is for an offence <e> <s> it is provided at line on page of the bill that <e>", "<cs> i have given the explanation <e> <s> i do not think i have anything to add to what i said before about it <e> <s> there is certainly indication in judicial dicta that where one is talking about days and one means the whole of the day it is wise to say so and that clear days is a good way of doing that and that is the one we have chosen <e> <s> i think i cannot say much more <e>", "<cs> this does go back to discussions that we had earlier about the matter <e> <s> i think it would not be appropriate to have this amendment in the bill as it stands at the moment but i have undertaken to lord hughes to consider various matters that he mentioned and i shall certainly indicate to him in due course what conclusion i have reached in the light of that reconsideration <e>", "<cs> i am certainly happy to look at the point that the noble lord has mentioned <e>", "<cs> the idea of this provision is to give the secretary of state power in effect to make incidental consequential transitional or supplementary provisions by order <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i gave the impression that i was not as sure of myself as i usually am <e> <s> i certainly have no hesitation in advising the committee that the bill as it stands is the correct form in relation to this particular clause <e>", "<cs> this bill so far as ministerial responsibility is concerned is the responsibility of the secretary of state for scotland and i think the technical position is that my departmental responsibility is to provide the draftsmen but provision for the drafting of a particular bill is the responsibility of the minister whose bill it is <e> <s> i say that only in view of the way the noble lord put his point <e>", "<cs> i think not <e> <s> what is being done in amendment no <e> <s> is to adapt the provisions of the weeds act so that they conform with the principles which are set out in respect of the subordinate legislation in the amendment which i moved earlier <e> <s> as i understand it and as i explained that is all that is happening <e>", "<cs> the situation is that so far as the english part of the legislation is concerned it is consistent with the structure of the english system of legislation in relation to roads or highways <e> <s> the scottish legislation and the parts affecting scotland in united kingdom legislation will be consistent with the scottish system when these amendments are made <e> <s> we have tried to be consistent throughout in that <e> <s> so far as the public utilities street works act is concerned the provisions there are adapted for both jurisdictions and are in my view adapted appropriately <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord would not like me to put myself in a position where i could not get the bill on leaving this house to go on its journey to the other place as perfect as it is possible for us to make it <e> <s> apart from anything else the noble lord has put to me some points which we shall have to consider in relation to further amendments and i feel certain that the noble lord with his great interest in and regard for the scottish system would like the bill now that it has gone thus far to be as perfect as possible when it leaves here <e>", "<cs> as i have already said i have no doubt that the noble lord would like the bill to be as perfect as possible <e> <s> if it appears as our work continues that the bill would be made more perfect by further amendments i am sure that the noble lord would wish me to come forward with them <e> <s> i am not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the welcome that has been given to this order <e> <s> it would be right to say that this consolidation marks an important landmark in the development of statutory company law but i tear that it will not be easy for me to prophesy how long a pause will follow thereafter <e>", "<cs> if i may take the last question of the noble lord lord bruce of donington first i think that he answered it himself in his introductory remarks when he pointed out that the limitation of liability in section of the act is repealed by schedule to this bill to which he drew attention <e> <s> my noble friend lord mottistone in his remarks made it clear that he was aware that that had happened <e> <s> the position is that the repeal of section <e>", "<cs> if i understood aright what the noble lord said a moment ago he has not fully understood what i said earlier <e> <s> i said earlier that under the arrangements that have existed up until now british telecom worked under schemes and therefore unless one had a limitation of liability one would require the kind of insurance to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> where one has contractual freedom one has the possibility of limiting ones liability under the contract subject always of course to the unfair contract terms legislation which regulates everybody else <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord wishes to make some intervention but i am trying to explain to him the position as i see it and he has not quite understood what i said on the last occasion <e> <s> no doubt it is my fault for not making it plain <e> <s> however i was explaining the reason for the existence of the limitation of liability under the present act the act and i have explained or tried to explain that the reason for that limitation is removed by the altered arrangements which we contemplate in this bill for the future where british telecom will have contractual freedom and will not operate under these so-called schemes <e>", "<cs> obviously that will depend upon the terms of the particular contract which british telecom operate <e> <s> of course the terms of the contract will no doubt be reflected in the payments that are made under it <e> <s> one would possibly get better guarantees the more expensive the services <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to prolong this debate perhaps unnecessarily <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon appears to pin his faith on a monopoly for protection of the consumer <e> <s> whatever experiences the noble baroness lady phillips has had of difficulties arising for the consumer in certain types of competitive business i strongly suggest that consumers have a good deal of experience of not getting the best service from monopolies <e> <s> all that we are saying in this clause is that along with other duties the secretary of state and the director have to exercise the functions which they have under this bill in a manner in which he in the case of the director and he in the case of the secretary of state considers is best calculated to promote the interests of the consumer and so on and then <e>", "<cs> i do not regard it as too harsh a criticism for the noble lord to say that i am less perceptive than my right honourable friend the prime minister or the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> the position as i think my noble friend appreciates is that clause <e>", "<cs> i gave an illustration of the reason why one must look at the circumstances to see whether any particular act is an anti-competitive act <e> <s> it is not easy to tell simply from looking at the act in isolation whether or not it is so <e> <s> one must look at the circumstances <e> <s> one must look at how it is practised and by whom it is practised <e> <s> i am not suggesting that this particular example is enshrined in the legislation <e> <s> in fact clause brings in the criteria from the fair trading act which are fairly general in character <e>", "<cs> first it is worth noticing that under the statute the words of clause impose a duty on the director and of course the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i think it is clear that everybody who has spoken supports the idea of innovation <e> <s> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has certainly quoted amply from my right honourable friend the prime minister showing how wisely she supports this particular idea <e> <s> i think that the observation that my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil made a little earlier about the desirability of not saying everything twice would apply here <e> <s> what we have done is to go so far with the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran as to go well beyond what he wants <e> <s> we have spelt out in very clear and full terms exactly the need to go in for innovation and we have used these words to describe it <e>", "<cs> so far as amendment no <e> <s> is concerned the need for the tailpiece to clause arises because a single piece of apparatus may not be a system <e> <s> one example which may show the need for this provision is the following <e> <s> supposing that an entrepreneur decides to connect a wire from an internal video system used by an hotel owner to convey video programmes to his guests rooms to the local cable companys system so that the entrepreneur could convey the cable companys programmes to the hotel guests without the permission of the cable operator and without paying him <e> <s> all he would have to do is to connect a wire <e>", "<cs> first i should say that as i have sought to explain the provisions of the bill relating to licensing which are affected by this <e>", "<cs> i am sure it must be my fault that your lordships may have a somewhat different impression of what i am seeking to say from what i intend <e> <s> what i seek to do is to maintain the position that licensing should be required to cover the areas covered by this amendment <e> <s> my noble friend has indicated that he would like to see the area covered by this amendment liberalised <e> <s> what i say is that to achieve that to any extent it is proper that this area should continue to be covered by licensing <e> <s> that is my answer to the amendment <e> <s> what i said is that we shall take account of what my noble friend is saying in considering what we can say in amplification of the policy which will determine how these licence powers shall be used in relation to the area with which he is concerned <e>", "<cs> what i indicated was that we would hope to amplify what has already been said in relation to the policy that will apply to the use of circuits leased from british telecom <e> <s> it is only the use of leased circuits that is in question <e> <s> what we hope to be able to do is to be a little more detailed than has yet been possible in relation to the policy that will apply in exercising the powers which the bill gives us in this connection <e>", "<cs> the situation certainly is that we shall give the further detail as soon as we are able to do so <e> <s> i should certainly hope that we shall be in a position to do that in time for the report stage <e> <s> the situation is that further detail has been under consideration for some time and that what we are intending by the statement to which i have referred is simply to fill in some further details on the aspects of licensing of private systems <e> <s> i certainly undertake and i am grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for his intervention that we shall do it at the earliest possible moment and i hope that we shall be in a position to do it for the report stage <e>", "<cs> the matter that i have in mind is that of giving further details in relation to the policy that we expect to be pursued in relation to the use of leased circuits <e> <s> it does not directly affect the terms of any of these amendments <e> <s> all it does is to indicate in a little more detail than we have yet been able to state it in relation to that particular matter the policy that would be pursued <e>", "<cs> i understand perfectly from what has been said the objective of the noble lord lord somers in moving this amendment and the noble lord lord ezra in supporting it <e> <s> as clause is drafted the secretary of state has discretion as to whether or not he includes in a licence that he is granting conditions of the sort described in clause <e>", "<cs> with great respect i do not feel able to accept that last contention because the fundamental duty is in clause and it pervades all the bill <e> <s> to seek to make apparent strengthenings in some places might well weaken its full effect <e> <s> clause imposes that duty and it is for the secretary of state or the director to see whether conditions are necessary under clause <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful for that support <e> <s> i certainly wish to do what i can to please the committee as i was perhaps not particularly successful earlier <e> <s> i feel that the correct structure is to have clause as imposing the duties and then <e>", "<cs> as your lordships have just heard the first part of the amendment is to leave out paragraph <e>", "<cs> in my submission to your lordships the way to have the provision in the major licences is that it be in the licences <e> <s> the idea of putting it into the general provisions of the primary legislation would make it appear that it was appropriate for all licences <e> <s> in view of what i have said about the great variety of types of licence it would be inconceivable that one would have arbitration clauses of this kind in a good number of them <e> <s> i hope that in the light of that the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe will feel able not to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with the first aspect of the amendment that is to say consultation between the director and the cable authority and then come to the more detailed aspects of it later <e> <s> first may i start with what is perhaps a truism but nevertheless an important one <e> <s> cable systems are telecommunication systems in just the same way as is the telephone network <e> <s> they are no different from other broad-band systems and the only reason that they have become generally known as cable systems is that it is proposed to send over them cable programme services defined in both clause of the bill and clause of the cable bill <e>", "<cs> this amendment raises quite an important matter in the way that my noble friend has moved it <e> <s> perhaps i could concentrate on one aspect of the matter <e> <s> as i understand it and the way he has explained it this amendment would require british telecom to connect each and every system which was licensed under clause to take british telecom as an example <e> <s> if we were to do this the secretary of state or the director would have to do one of two things <e> <s> the first would be to write into all <e>", "<cs> i was referring to the technical incompatibility of the one system with the other <e> <s> the point that i am making is that if you allowed a complete free-for-all you would have a situation where people might attempt to interconnect incompatible systems <e> <s> on the other hand if you wanted to permit interconnection you would have to lay down the correct technical standards but you would not wish to impose these technical standards on systems which do not want to interconnect <e> <s> the imposition of the standards and the desire to interconnect require themselves to be properly related i was about to say connected <e> <s> you must relate them properly <e> <s> that is the point i was seeking to make <e>", "<cs> obviously i should have regard to what was said before about needs in what i am now going to say <e> <s> so far as this amendment is concerned and as my noble friend has explained the amendment the government share my noble friends objectives <e> <s> i would wish to explain briefly how we intend to achieve them <e> <s> the government have already set out their policy on high-level interconnect <e> <s> condition of the draft british telecommunications licence lays down the principles on which the government intend interconnect to take place <e> <s> our aims were underlined on th november when my right honourable friend the minister of state for industry and information technology said in another place <e>", "<cs> from my noble friends introduction i took it that he was finding the situation a little different from what it was when the amendment was put down in respect of what my noble friend lord cockfield said earlier about the chance to look at the licence before the public telecommunications system was licensed <e>", "<cs> i am greatly obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> i shall be very happy to draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state all that has been said in this exchange <e> <s> there are a number of conditions in the draft licence which bear on this problem apart from condition <e>", "<cs> the government sympathise with what i believe to be the main purpose of the amendment namely to ensure that all those with an interest including consumers and possibly competitors are fully consulted and their comments taken into account before a licence which could affect their interests is granted <e> <s> indeed that is also the governments intention <e> <s> where we differ is just on the detail of how it should be achieved <e> <s> the amendment seeks to enable the secretary of state or the director to require applications for licences to be published <e> <s> i presume that the intention is that the secretary of state and the director should receive from interested parties comments and representations on such applications though the amendment does not say so <e>", "<cs> the government agree with the general aims underlying this amendment but we disagree with the attempt to achieve these aims through the bill itself <e> <s> our view first is that if the bill were to contain any special rules intended for british telecom these rules should apply also and fairly to all public telecommunications operators <e> <s> the government endorse the first specific proposal in the amendment which is to require certain operators to set up separately managed and separately accounting subsidiaries for any telecommunications apparatus manufacture that they undertake <e> <s> the government think that limitations of this general kind should apply to all public telecommunications operators regardless of their market share <e> <s> some discussion of the difficulties of the market share concept has taken place already <e>", "<cs> with respect i think that that question is answered by what i said earlier namely that the government intend that when british telecom itself purchases per cent <e> <s> or more of any description of telecommunications apparatus it would have to go through the open tender procedure <e> <s> i would foresee no difficulty from the point of view of the apparatus that the noble countess lady mar mentioned <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to intervene <e> <s> i am not in favour of delay for its own sake either <e> <s> the concern that my noble friend has evinced i perfectly understand <e> <s> the procedures for modifying licence conditions do envisage some delay in those circumstances where a licensee does not agree that an amendment should be made <e> <s> however that delay is for as short a period as possible consistent with a thorough investigation of the matters referred to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> the requirement for the director to specify a period of up to six months within which the commission must report is the same as the period allowed for merger references under the fair trading act <e> <s> in framing this provision in the bill the government saw the need to balance different considerations <e> <s> on the one hand is the clear desire to minimise the period of uncertainty for the licensee concerned and the need for speedy remedies to matters which affect the public interest <e> <s> on the other is the need for the commission to have a sufficient period of time to investigate matters which may critically affect the licensees business and also the wider interests of other operators manufacturers of telecommunications equipment consumers and users of services and apparatus and so on <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> as i understand the amendment it is pretty much in line with the amendments that i have proposed to other clauses <e> <s> on that assumption if my noble friend is prepared to withdraw this amendment i will undertake to bring forward an amendment on report which i believe will be appropriate to deal with the point he makes <e>", "<cs> i think that that should he possible <e> <s> i would hope to facilitate it later tonight or possibly tomorrow morning <e>", "<cs> i think that it is possible to regard the amendment to which my noble friend has just spoken as a kind of criticism of the amendment which i have just moved <e> <s> in that light may i say that the arrangements which we have proposed in the bill as amended by the amendments that i have just made are designed to avoid the excessive litigation which has been a feature of regulatory activity in other parts of the world and to give protection to individuals who cannot afford to go to law <e> <s> such an approach is however incompatible with a free-for-all where individuals can take licensees to court for breaches of licence conditions as my noble friend is proposing <e> <s> to allow that would ensure that the directors key role as the kind of policeman of the condition was undermined and by allowing all aggrieved persons recourse to the courts would create a certain recipe for a good deal of confusion and delay <e> <s> it could also open the door to a flood of contentious litigation and take us some way down the road of experience in other parts of the world <e>", "<cs> as i sought to explain the amendment which i hope to move in just a little while will delete the provisions from clause which had the effect of making a criminal offence arise in relation to interfering with the sending on of a message and i shall explain that a little more fully in relation to amendment no <e> <s> r <e>", "<cs> when i explained the answer that we had to amendment no <e> <s> as a criticism of the amendment which i had then moved i of course took account of amendment no <e> <s> at the same time <e> <s> this makes it unnecessary for me to repeat the multiplicity of litigation argument <e> <s> all i need to do is to refer to it <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has clearly and succinctly mentioned the history of this provision and explained the arguments in favour of the clause <e> <s> what is not so clear to us is why call boxes of public telecommunications operators should be singled out for this special treatment over and above the provisions of the general law <e> <s> i am sure all your lordships recognise the desirability of adopting very strict criteria in deciding whether to have statutory criminal offences <e> <s> i find it a little difficult to be convinced that this proposal satisfies these criteria <e> <s> my noble friend has adverted to the proceedings in standing committee on the previous bill and described his impression of them and i would not wish to go into that <e> <s> but the result of their deliberations was to drop a somewhat similar provision from that bill and the government thought it best in this bill to abide by the decision of that standing committee <e> <s> it may be that the noble lord will <e>", "<cs> the government of course very much appreciate the matter which my noble friend has raised <e> <s> we entirely appreciate the reason why he has put this matter forward <e> <s> however we have a particular responsibility to ensure that before we increase penalties it is the appropriate action <e> <s> i question whether the type of case that my noble friend has particularly referred to ought to be lumped along with the rather petty cases which can also come under this provision <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this is to facilitate the changes which i am proposing <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> b is the second of these <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a is the first transposition and amendment no <e> <s> b is the second <e> <s> i am saying that amendments nos <e> <s> c and e are the main amendments <e> <s> i think it is right to try to explain why we are doing all this using amendments nos <e> <s> c and e as the principal amendments which i shall of course seek to explain <e> <s> as i say they are the main amendments and they seek to amend clause of the bill so that the offence of dishonestly using a public telecommunication system with intent to avoid payment will have a somewhat wider application <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> a and b are purely consequential and seek to transpose the order of the clauses dealing with the offences so that if the amendments to clause are accepted the bill will continue to group together the offences connected with public telecommunication systems <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> the answer is yes <e> <s> the first objective of the amendments to clause is to extend the ambit of the offence from public telecommunication systems to all telecommunication systems licensed under clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was suggesting that a complete answer to the problem that i raised about secrecy was the fact that the courts can sit <e>", "<cs> we are in sympathy with the aims of this amendment <e> <s> it has been said in another place that the governments aim is to encourage a very wide take-up of shares by the public and my noble friend lord cockfield indicated this a little while ago <e> <s> in this way the public will have a much more direct say in the running of british telecom than they have had to date <e> <s> your lordships will have seen the government amendments that facilitate the despatch of share application forms so that the public at large may have the opportunity of subscribing <e> <s> i refer to amendment no <e> <s> a which we shall be moving soon <e> <s> we are also considering a number of ways for making british telecom shares more attractive to individual subscribers and small investors although no decisions on the various options have yet been made <e>", "<cs> certainly that possibility will be kept in mind <e> <s> it is right to retain flexibility in the way in which this matter will be taken forward because it is right to make these decisions as a whole towards the time of actual flotation <e> <s> but i can certainly assure the noble lord that his suggestions will be kept in mind <e>", "<cs> i think that i have said as much as i reasonably can about this matter and i do not want to add anything seductive as the noble lords invitation may be <e>", "<cs> as i understood the point which the noble lord lord weinstock made earlier it was that the secretary of state is taking responsibility for the liabilities of british telecom as at the date of transfer if the successor company on being wound up does not meet those liabilities <e> <s> the reason for that is that up until the time of transfer british telecom being a nationalised operation would be understood to be supported by the government and therefore those who were creditors of it would have become creditors on that basis <e>", "<cs> that is a slightly different matter from the one with which i have been endeavouring to deal <e> <s> clause is not designed to make good every possible improvement that could be made in the situation <e> <s> it is concerned only with making certain that so far as current employees pension entitlements are concerned they have the same backing for the performance of these as they would have if the company were in state ownership <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord bruce of donington is referring to the obligation under clause the standing behind british telecom pic and i think that is what the noble lord is referring to then the situation is that we expect british telecom plc to be able to meet those liabilities <e> <s> clause makes it perfectly plain that it is only if british telecom plc came to be wound up that the government would have any responsibility to pay anything under clause <e> <s> accordingly our fervent belief is that no actual payment will be required under clause <e>", "<cs> i can only answer one question at a time and the excepted liabilities are not liabilities in respect of the pensions which are payable or which are a responsibility a liability of british telecom at the transfer date <e> <s> the excepted liabilities are not those that are covered under clause at all <e> <s> the excepted liabilities are liabilities which subsist by virtue of a deed of covenant of nd november made between the post office and the then trustees of the post office staff superannuation scheme to make good a deficiency in the pension arrangements up to that point <e> <s> much earlier <e>", "<cs> i am trying to distinguish between the two questions <e> <s> it is important that we distinguish between the questions asked here <e> <s> the noble lord in the first attack on this point was talking about liabilities that i referred to in answer to the noble lord lord weinstock which are not the same as the excepted liabilities <e> <s> the provision so far as the excepted liabilities are concerned is that they remain liabilities of british telecom the shell company and the arrangements under which these are discharged are set out in schedule <e> <s> the manner in which they are to be discharged is provided for under the provisions of various paragraphs in that schedule and particularly at paragraph <e>", "<cs> i have no difficulty in understanding the point once the noble lord has come to focus on this question <e> <s> the answer is contained in the provisions of paragraph of the fifth schedule <e>", "<cs> may i say first of all that the eec provision i had in mind particularly was the listing directive the council directive on listing particulars which requires that listing particulars should be widely available for example by publication in newspapers or by free availability at a variety of addresses <e>", "<cs> i do not have it in my head but i am sure i shall be able to give the noble lord a note of it <e> <s> it is one of the three council directives regulating what i might broadly call stock exchange matters and the one that seems most relevant is that on listing particulars <e>", "<cs> there is absolutely no question of people being in any way conned <e> <s> they will be given a notice which will direct their attention to the full terms of the prospectus and they will have the full protection that any investor has whether he is investing or under the general law <e> <s> in addition they will have the protection of the secretary of state standing behind the notice so if there is anything at all they can find fault with in the notice along the lines that the noble lord lord bruce of donington is suggesting the secretary of state will be responsible for that <e> <s> so we have made every possible protection available for the subscribers at the same <e>", "<cs> of course this bill is concerned with british telecommunications <e> <s> it would not be possible in this bill to make a provision of general application <e> <s> but i think that the council directive on listing particulars might well encourage a more general provision <e> <s> i would not want to involve myself in a matter that is irrelevant to this bill tonight <e> <s> in this bill we are concerned only with the desirability of doing it in this particular situation <e> <s> a more general one will await another time <e> <s> the noble lord may feel that this is such a desirable way of proceeding that he will wish to bring in a measure of his own <e>", "<cs> as i said in my submission the protection is at least as good here as it is in the general case but it is applied in a slightly different way which is appropriate to this case <e>", "<cs> i do not know where the suggestion came from that a proper prospectus will not be prepared <e> <s> i certainly did not say that and i do not think anybody else did either <e> <s> there is no question whatever of there not being a proper prospectus prepared but the prospectus has to state the position <e>", "<cs> i never said that at all <e> <s> the noble lord is completely misrepresenting what i said <e> <s> what i said in answer to the noble countess lady mar was that for the reasons which the noble lord lord bruce has just explained one has to bring out the full prospectus which is what we are talking about at a time that is close to the date of the flotation <e> <s> we seem to be agreed about that so we are making some progress <e>", "<cs> this bill is a consolidation measure <e> <s> i think that the changes to which the noble lord refers were made in the legislation which is being consolidated <e> <s> but i feel certain that the arrangements for funding are suitable <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am content to leave it at that and stop the tautology <e>", "<cs> my lords as i would understand it the need for the directors help and assistance would arise possibly in a situation where the person who might otherwise seek to enforce the condition was not eligible for legal aid <e> <s> this is really an additional method of assisting a person over and above the ordinary provisions of legal aid as i would see it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say first and possibly quite briefly that it does not appear to me that the amendment that my noble friend proposes would in fact effectuate the purpose that he had in mind in the discussion that followed <e> <s> so far as statements are concerned i think that if i have learnt anything from the committees proceedings it is that it would be most unwise for me to promise any further statement and i do not propose to be unwise on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords while i should be glad to give any assistance that i properly could to my noble friend it would be unwise for me to go further than i have already gone <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said i am very happy to draw to the attention of my colleagues as well as studying myself what my noble friend lord mottistone has said <e> <s> if the interests to which my noble friend has referred wish to make representations on these matters then of course they will be very carefully considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has shown precisely how his amendment would work in this connection but perhaps i may just go to the substantive point that he makes <e> <s> i think that his concern is that there should be power to deal with problems relating to intellectual property rights that might arise in connection with the operation of the licensing system <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention is that to have the effect which i described the terms would go in the licences of british telecom and other public telecommunications systems operators <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that so far i have not quite understood why it is thought that these provisions are required to be inserted in the bill as proposed in this amendment in order to assist the government to deal with the european economic community and its laws and requirements <e> <s> i do not think i have much to add to what my noble friend lord glenarthur said in answer to lord spens manuscript amendment which appears to cover very much the same ground as this amendment <e> <s> this situation is covered by the provisions of clause and the relationship between <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has explained his amendment very clearly <e> <s> if i am going to answer i am afraid that i shall have to do so at some length <e> <s> i should be happy if he would think it appropriate for me to write to him with the explanation but if he would prefer that i give it now i am very willing to launch into it <e>", "<cs> i would hope to be able to give it to him almost immediately <e> <s> the answer is that we believe that the points he makes are already covered in the provisions of the bill and the amendments are unnecessary <e> <s> but i will give him a slightly more elaborate answer than that in writing if he will agree to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think not <e> <s> i would not wish to set up such a precedent <e> <s> i was giving my answer to both amendments <e> <s> they are unnecessary <e> <s> i shall elaborate that for those who wish it <e> <s> if the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey wishes to join in this by all means <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it must be the lateness of the hour but i certainly do not see the cat <e> <s> i think it is an invisible cat so far as most of us are concerned and exists only in the imagination of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey because of course the purpose of clause is to define a particular type of licence namely one which includes certain conditions and then it applies to that type of licence the procedural requirements of subsection <e> <s> i must say that appears to me to be a very logical and reasonable way of doing it <e> <s> i would not myself think that subsection is more substantial or more purposive than <e>", "<cs> my lords i am moving amendment no <e> <s> and i am speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i would expect that minor revisions of these amendments may well be required at the next stage of the bill and anything your lordships have to say to help us in connection with this problem will of course be taken into account in that consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the substantial matters we seek to cover have been dealt with in these amendments <e> <s> i have indicated that of course this is an important and difficult problem and that we are dealing with the matter in a slightly different way from the former amendment no <e> <s> but that we shall in considering whether any further revision of what we propose ought to be made take account of the fact that that way of dealing with the matter has been proposed <e> <s> that is what i had in mind when i spoke earlier <e> <s> in my view it is entirely acceptable to maintain that sort of <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house perhaps i might be allowed a word or two in answer to the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge <e> <s> first of all it has been necessary in the way that i explained slightly to extend the directors powers because otherwise as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran also explained there would be a defect in the way these powers could operate <e> <s> you could have a situation where an operator was moving in and out of compliance <e> <s> there is an extension which is in my view a necessary but very limited extension <e>", "<cs> my lords what i sought to do and i think it is fair that i should do that to the house was to explain the problem that our approach has involved in it <e> <s> but we have considered what is possible in the way of a solution and what we propose should be done <e> <s> i expressly directed your lordships attention to this and if any of your lordships have any point that you wish to make about this aspect of the matter i shall be most grateful and very indebted to hear it <e> <s> but i am not suggesting that these amendments are not appropriate and i certainly ask your lordships to agree with the first of them <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington has linked these amendments with previous ones but i am not sure that the point is in any way the same <e> <s> in my view what we are proposing here is the best solution in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all indicate the general position as i see it and then try to deal with some of the particular matters that have been raised by your lordships on this amendment <e> <s> the thrust of this bill is to impose conditions on those who hold licences and it is clear that the intention is that they should comply with those conditions the enforcement mechanism being through the director general <e> <s> i should first like briefly to remind your lordships that we have decided that licence conditions should not be directly enforceable in the courts by individuals affected but rather that it should be a matter for the director general and his specialist staff <e> <s> first we wanted to ensure that there are swift cheap and effective enforcement procedures <e> <s> i emphasise cheap because it is one of the intentions that the enforcement procedures should be cheap so far as those concerned are affected by them and also that they should be swift and effective <e> <s> i must say that i should have thought the sort of periods referred to by <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is that breach of a licence condition is not made actionable of itself <e> <s> in other words what is actionable and the only right of action which arises is where a breach is ajudged by the director general to have taken place and he expresses that judgment either by a provisional order or by a final order <e> <s> it is in respect of an order of the director general that liability to damages arises <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a duty which is actionable in law under the bill from the time when the provisional or final order is made <e> <s> there is no duty actionable in law under the bill as it stands at an earlier time than that for the reasons which i have sought to explain <e> <s> i think that the noble lord <e> <s> lord elystan-morgan in putting forward what he did earlier was really raising that question <e> <s> if one answers that question in the way that the bill does then it follows that the correct procedure for enforcing these orders so far as damage is concerned is in respect of the orders and not in respect of the conditions in the licence <e> <s> but of course the whole thrust of the bill is that the licence conditions are to be obeyed and that the enforcement mechanism for making sure that they are obeyed is the director general with his powers <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a question of whether one can assume that heavy damages could have occurred before the director general takes action <e> <s> the system is designed to enable the director general to take action in time really to prevent the occurrence that my noble friend fears <e> <s> i believe that speed of action is the key to this matter but it is a corollary of what i have said that there is no legal right conferred by the bill to recover damages in respect of matters before the date of the provisional order <e> <s> i have sought to explain the reason for that and the background to that but i do not accept that the situation which my noble friend lord trenchard is concerned about should be allowed to arise because the remedy for it is speed of action on the part of the director general <e>", "<cs> my lords i think one of the objections that sometimes one gets in the courts to questions is that they admit of only as it were a yes or a no answer <e> <s> the noble lord lord weinstock is asking me whether everything is committed to the arbitrary judgment of the director general <e> <s> of course the answer to that is that these matters are committed to the judgment of the director general but he has very clear obligations with which to comply in coming to these judgments <e> <s> he has very clearly defined duties and an obligation as i pointed out to take action if there is non-compliance <e> <s> so it is not a question of arbitrary judgment in the sense of judgment which is not properly principled and not in accordance with the law it is a judgment in accordance with a very full and fully set out range of statutory duties <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord used the phrase bare minimum and of course it is the bare minimum to do what <e> <s> it is the minimum necessary the staff necessary to achieve the objects or the duties placed upon the director general and one of the objects is that he be in a position to react swiftly to this particular matter <e> <s> i have no reason to suppose that those who have willed this end for him will not will the appropriate means <e> <s> that does not mean that he will have an unnecessarily large number of people it just means that he will have the correct number of people to discharge his function <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely certain that i have comprehended precisely what the question is that my noble friend is putting to me if i have not dealt with it already <e> <s> i thought i explained that the enforcement machinery for the licence conditions and we take the view that the licence conditions are there to be obeyed is the director general with his powers <e> <s> therefore i think i have met the point which the noble lord was putting to me <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the difficulties is that one has to cut ones obligations in a particular way <e> <s> if too much is done to undercut the need for that the very difficulty that my noble friend is suggesting may well arise <e> <s> it is of the essence of the proper performance of the job of the director general that he should act quickly and swiftly <e> <s> i am not certainly as at present advised inclined to do anything which would in any way undermine the importance of swiftness of action by the director general <e> <s> the other point is as the noble lord lord elystan morgan pointed out <e> <s> that if you go back to the period before the provisional order is made you are in an element of retrospection which as he pointed out could be regarded as rather damaging <e> <s> therefore while i accept and my noble friend has much more experience of this matter than i have that some government departments might not move as quickly as others would like to see them move and some agencies of government might be like that we believe that it is essential for the director general to be able to move very quickly and that it would be wrong to put something into the bill which is in the bill only upon the assumption that he is not able to move fast enough <e>", "<cs> my lords the swiftness of action is written into the bill by the obligation to carry out enforcement <e> <s> that is the place where swiftness of action is implied if swiftness of action is required <e> <s> he has the duty of enforcement <e> <s> as i said it seems to me in the nature of matters that swiftness of action is required for enforcement in this area at least from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords the government oppose this amendment <e> <s> in our view this amendment would do serious harm to those who depend on telecommunications and i shall try to explain why <e> <s> i first must remind your lordships that clause was amended in committee to put in the provisions that we are dealing with at the moment at the same time as what is now clause was radically altered <e>", "<cs> my lords if i could go back for a moment to the provisions of clause what a person founding on clause has to show is not only that the act has the result of breaching the duty in other words destroying the service but that it was done wholly or partly for the purpose of achieving that result <e> <s> in other words the purpose was to bring about a cessation of service rather than to secure for the person in question and his colleagues an increase in remuneration <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge i do not think he is giving enough effect to the use of the word purpose <e> <s> it is not just a question of achieving the result <e> <s> he is saying that any industrial action is likely to achieve that kind of result <e> <s> we are not saying that that is the test <e> <s> we are asking what is the purpose with which this was done <e> <s> was it the purpose of achieving that particular result wholly or partly or was it the purpose of achieving something completely different namely for example an improvement in the terms and conditions of service of the people in question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord <e> <s> lord molloy is not perhaps giving sufficient consideration to what i have put before your lordships <e> <s> he talks about massive stuff that i have read out <e> <s> he can describe it in that way if he wishes but it is important to remember the background and to remember that parliament long ago thought that it was important to put into the statute book criminal offences in connection with these matters <e> <s> that is because of the importance that parliament attached to the giving of these services <e>", "<cs> my lords i have sought to explain that we are not saying precisely the same thing <e> <s> as far as i understand the amendment it is saying that it will be sufficient for a person to escape this liability if he shows that his main purpose is for example to secure improved terms and conditions of employment <e> <s> if his purpose includes a desire to bring about a breach of an order in our view he should be liable <e> <s> that is the difference between us <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps with the leave of the house i could answer that by saying that as the noble lord explained it in the example which he gave the ultimate result he has in mind is the improvement of conditions <e> <s> that is the crux of this matter <e> <s> the word partly does not interfere with that in any way partly does not mean that the ultimate purpose is replaced by some intermediate purpose <e> <s> if the purpose is to achieve the result of improved <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may with the leave of the house answer the question of the noble lord lord somers the situation is that our clause does not prevent industrial action because industrial action will be taken for the purpose of improving the terms and conditions of work of the employees <e> <s> there is no provision in this bill which prevents that <e> <s> what this bill is dealing with is a situation where employees take action not for the purpose of improving their terms and conditions of employment but for the purpose of bringing about a breach of the licence conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is right if i may continue with the leave of your lordships then he has nothing to fear from the bills provisions and his amendment is utterly worthless <e> <s> it is because we have to guard against exactly the situation that he is figuring that we need to put in such a clause <e> <s> accordingly the situation is that we are dealing with that position in which the person in question has the purpose not of improving his own terms and conditions but of doing something different namely bringing about some interruption of the telecommunications service for some purpose which has nothing to do with that but achieves that result <e> <s> it is that particular situation we are dealing with <e> <s> we are not interfering in any way otherwise with the right to strike or the possibility of industrial action by those involved <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation so far as this amendment is concerned is that section of the employment act applies to these provisions in any event and therefore it appears to us that this amendment is quite unnecessary <e> <s> if anything else were to be achieved a specific amendment would have been required <e> <s> so the provision of section applies to this and therefore in our view the amendment which the noble lord has proposed is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be convenient if i were to speak as the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has done to amendments nos <e> <s> b and c and also to amendment no <e> <s> aa which deals with the same matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i sought to explain fairly fully in committee why we wished to make possible this course of action in this case <e> <s> it appears impracticable to achieve a wide circulation of a prospectus of the size that this one would be in the time that is available from the date at which the price is fixed to the date at which the prospectus has to be issued <e> <s> as i explained at the committee stage and your lordships accepted my explanation there is a good reason for doing this <e> <s> it is highly desirable that the shares of british telecom should be spread as far as possible <e>", "<cs> very shortly the reason is that it is intended to cover this matter in a general development order <e> <s> the general development order will cover this matter and other matters <e> <s> it is very much hoped that it will be ready in time to take over but because of the range of matters covered we cannot be certain of that and that is the reason for this provision my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the point which is raised in amendment no <e> <s> by the noble lord is the point which as he says is dealt with primarily in amendment no <e> <s> because we accepted the reasoning behind the noble lords amendment no <e> <s> and tabled amendment no <e> <s> which deals with exactly the same point in a slightly different way <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has said it might be convenient to deal with amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> the government sympathise entirely with the general aims which i understand underlie these two amendments <e> <s> as i understand them both seek to ensure that the bill makes proper provision to ensure that businesses can use leased circuits provided by british telecom or mercury to improve their internal business communications and to communicate with other firms with which they have close links <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that although i have to resist the amendments we do in fact support that aim <e> <s> i should also like to thank my noble friend for the trouble he took earlier in explaining to me at some length exactly what his amendments are aiming at and on that account perhaps i am able to give him a fuller answer than might otherwise have been the case <e>", "<cs> my lords my first difficulty is to relate the excellent speech which the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran made to the amendment which he has moved <e> <s> if your lordships will look with me at clause and the place into which he proposes to insert his amendment as i understand it there may be something wrong with my understanding and i should be glad to be corrected clause at present says <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down in order that i may understand the sense of his proposed amendment can he refer me to the reference in clause to a modification <e> <s> for that is the only way his amendment would make sense as i would understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the original amendment no <e> <s> which is now incorporated in the bill and these amendments then my noble friend lord torphichen is right when he says that they would cover quite a large variety of matters <e> <s> the three amendments to which my noble friend lord morris has spoken seek to alter the effect of amendment no <e> <s> which he successfully moved at report stage <e> <s> the deletion of the requirement to have the prior consent of the director general would open up a fairly free field for litigation <e> <s> this is particu-larly the case where because of the nature of things the licence conditions will be imprecise <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the situation so far as i am concerned is that this amendment is put down by us in order to deal with questions that were raised on the preceding occasion <e> <s> in considering this matter i have had particularly in mind the way in which these questions were dealt with in this house sitting in its judicial capacity in the <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord observes it is a scottish case and from my point of view all the better for that <e> <s> lord simon who again perhaps had qualities that were relating to that particular situation said in that case <e>", "<cs> i think as the noble lord will appreciate as he reads the clause as amended by amendments that we are proposing that the result is to test the question of whether the act which induces a breach of duty or interferes with its performance causes that person to sustain loss or damage and is done wholly or partly for the purpose of achieving that result <e> <s> in other words if part of the purpose is the achieving of the result of damage to the plaintiff then liability would be established <e> <s> but of course it would be for the plaintiff or the claimant to prove that <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to establish a statutory procedure for the disclosure of information about a customers use of the telephone system <e> <s> it does so in a way which closely mirrors the arrangements described in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord in moving his amendments and i think he has moved all the amendments in relation to clause with which he wished to deal suggested that the principal concern was with respect to whether or not a full prospectus would be issued <e> <s> i think he was particu-larly concerned whether or not there had been resort to some very short form of prospectus <e> <s> the situation is as your lordships will see that in this section full prospectus means a prospectus which complies or is deemed to comply with the requirements of schedule to the companies act <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has explained his purpose is to change the structure of the bill which i tried to explain at some length earlier <e> <s> the proposal to employ the new terminology was widely canvassed and was accepted as <e>", "<cs> i am obliged <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am not able to say how often it has arisen <e> <s> the noble lord will appreciate that it is a possibility that has to be taken into account that a roads authority for example the secretary of state would arrange to transfer the responsibility of the road from himself to a local roads authority or there might be a change from one local roads authority to another <e> <s> it does not seem appropriate to have advertisement at that stage and accordingly this amendment deals with a possibility that might arise and it seems right to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords this provision is designed for dealing with frontagers and the like <e> <s> so far as the financial responsibilities are concerned the situation is that the rating burden will be a matter for the local authority and in that situation one can well understand that they would be able to take the necessary action to bring what has happened to the attention of their ratepayers <e> <s> this is not a provision dealing with ratepayers in general <e> <s> this is a provision dealing with specific people who require notice <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment may have <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord very much with his great experience he is able to anticipate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord lord ross but i think i ought to read what i have to say all the same <e> <s> motorways would certainly be a word which a lot of people would understand <e> <s> the truth of the matter is however that not all the special roads are motorways and therefore to make the amendment superficially attractive to the noble lord would i think be a mistake <e> <s> i hope in the light of that consideration he may feel able to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords the ordinary authority would be the district planning authority but as the noble lord lord carmichael knows there are situations in which you have a general authority for example such as the western isles which is a general authority not properly described as a district planning authority <e> <s> it is to cover that situation that i mentioned that <e>", "<cs> my lords the regional planning authority may be a general planning authority if the functions are so given <e> <s> the definition of the general planning authority is in the local government scotland act and the general planning authorities are the borders region and highlands region dumfries and galloway region and the islands council <e> <s> i gave the islands council as the the most typical example that came to my mind quickly but the general authorites have all of these <e> <s> it is appropriate that in these areas these authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i have carefully considered the suggestions which were made by the noble lord at committee stage <e> <s> i wrote to the noble lord with the considerations which led us to think that the phrase is better left as it is <e> <s> i can see the force of his argument but on balance i believe it is not wise to introduce a doubt by changing a provision where it would be better to make it clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords for their comments on this clause and certainly if we are able to think of a better word we shall do so <e> <s> up to now we have not been able to do so <e> <s> we had hoped that the noble lord lord ross would help us but i appreciate the task which he so eloquently described to us <e> <s> so far we have not been able to think of anything better but we shall not discontinue our efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course perfectly right that the words by virtue of are being substituted for the word under <e> <s> i said originally i think that the word under was not accurate and i was wishing to add by virtue of <e> <s> that was intended to be instead of the word under <e> <s> the reason that the word under is not accurate in this particular context is that there is no direct power under the clause to stop up a private access but the clause empowers the road authority to enter into an agreement to stop up the access and it is under the agreement and therefore by virtue of the clause that the access is closed <e> <s> it depends on the phraseology in the particular provision <e> <s> if the provision does it directly itself it would be appropriate to say by <e> <s> if the provision contains a direct authority it would be under <e> <s> if the provision contains an authority to enter into something else then it is by virtue of <e> <s> that is the reason for these three phrases or words occurring in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it depends on the context as i am sure the noble lord appreciates <e>", "<cs> my lords my impression is that the cleansing provisions would deal with the kind of point that the noble lord has in mind so far as removal is concerned <e> <s> with regard to the fine it is level on the standard scale which as at this date is i think i speak from memory <e> <s> the figures are given at the moment in the schedule though we are proposing later to take them out for the reason that they will become outdated and it might be misleading to leave them there <e> <s> yes is the amount of the penalty under level at the present time <e> <s> perhaps i may later have an opportunity to reply more fully to the noble lord on the first aspect of what he mentioned in relation to the statute to which he referred <e> <s> but i think i have answered the principal points that he has made and i am obliged to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i would respectfully doubt whether the clause as it is worded <e>", "<cs> my lords the point is that the danger arises from the fence as electrified <e> <s> but obviously i am happy to consider what the noble lord has said to see if we can get it even better <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the structure of the bill is concerned we have tried to distinguish between the carriageway the footway the footpath and so on so as to make it plain when we are dealing with for example only a carriageway <e> <s> but road is defined to include the carriageway and also the footway if there is one in other words the pavement as well <e> <s> so it covers the whole lot and it makes it easier precisely to define the scope of any obligation <e> <s> to take this example the noble lord pointed out to me that before we did it only for the carriageway <e> <s> that was not satisfactory for the reasons which he gave <e> <s> we are able to make it precise as covering also what we might call the pavement or the footway simply by using the word road <e> <s> that extends to cover the whole thing <e> <s> that is the explanation of why we do it this way <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i understand the question this does not arise in relation to this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords cleanse is appropriate in this situation i suppose <e> <s> this is a <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall resist the temptation to intervene between the noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords that is my understanding that it will go in that place and the appropriate numbering will go in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i cannot answer that question <e> <s> these amendments would be described by many of my colleagues <e> <s> i think as drafting amendments in the ordinary situation <e> <s> whether it helps to repeat that for the number of times that it would be necessary i am not certain <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i would add that so far as the question of the noble lord lord ross of marnock is concerned the two passages to which he drew attention are perfectly consistent because they are related to the context in which the word appears <e> <s> one has to take account of context in making these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that information <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships may be aware another place has disagreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to your lordships who have welcomed the action taken by the government and another place in this connection <e> <s> i will now try to deal with the specific points that have been raised <e> <s> first as to the point made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington on amendment no <e> <s> if i have understood correctly the way these amendments go together that is a fairly important if amendment no <e> <s> on this paper affects the line to which the noble lord lord bruce was referring <e> <s> the result is that if you take account of amendment no <e> <s> already made as it were and then go on to amendment no <e> <s> the two together make correct sense <e> <s> i know it is quite difficult to follow this and i would not ask the noble lord to give an immediate answer but that is my impression and also the impression that has been advised to me and i hope that it is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed and that the house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to in lieu thereof <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> to your lordships amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment remedies an omission to subsection of the new clause added to part vi of

tremendous amount of work which your lordships did so successfully makes this a very minor omission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to draw my noble friends remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords assuming that your lordships agree with the motion i am now moving i think i can assure your lordships that this is the final stage except for royal assent <e>",

clause as drafted has that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey has pointed to one aspect of this matter <e> <s> i think that it might well be that in some circumstances it would not be reasonable in other words that there were no steps that were reasonable to take in the particular circumstances <e> <s> but i should have thought on the whole that that would be rather unlikely and that faced with snow and ice endangering the safe passage of pedestrians and vehicles over public roads one would expect there to be some steps that the local authority could take over time which it would be reasonable for them to take <e>", "<cs> my lords there may be a slight misunderstanding which seems to have persisted no doubt it is my fault for not being able to remove it that the idea of this bill was to remove the word highway from the scottish vocabulary <e>", "<cs> my lords maybe i should correct myself <e> <s> the misunderstanding is that the bill attempts to withdraw the word highway for example from the scottish legal vocabulary <e> <s> there is no such intention <e> <s> the intention of the bill is to provide a structure for roads legislation so that if in a statute the word road is used it will be used consistently and people will be able to tell exactly what it is referring to <e> <s> if one cares in ordinary or legal language to refer to it as a highway one may be introducing a certain element of confusion <e> <s> in the statutory provisions the desire is to create a system under which the basic structure is that of a road <e> <s> as i pointed out on the last occasion by far the majority of scottish roads authorities use that expression for their departments <e> <s> lothian is the authority that is different from the others in using the word highway to describe its department <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships of course the noble lord lord mackie of benshie will see in the definition in clause that <e>", "<cs> my lords now that i have the opportunity to do so i was wishing to say that i will accept the amendment <e> <s> the reason i accept it is this <e> <s> when this bill was originally introduced the words snow gate came in another clause but we have been able to simplify that and to delete it as a result of suggestions made to us by noble lords opposite at the earlier stage <e> <s> the position is that snow gate appears only in clause and therefore as the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey has said it is not necessary to have it <e> <s> therefore i accept the first amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of this provision that the noble lord lord lord ross of marnock seeks to separate out from clause is in fact to explain that certain roads do not attract the powers and duties contained in the bill <e> <s> the provision is a consequence of the committee under the noble lord lord stodart of leaston who recommended that footpaths in a recreation area should be the responsibility of the district council rather than the region <e> <s> in view of its explanatory nature it is right that it should be contained and remain in the interpretation clause <e> <s> the question is obviously open to different points of view but it seems appropriate to have it here as explaining the extent of the earlier provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> in doing so i should like to take the opportunity to thank those noble lords who have contributed to the deliberations on this bill <e> <s> it would be invidious perhaps to try to single out those who have particularly participated but certainly i would like to make clear my gratitude to the noble lords lord ross of marnock lord carmichael of kelvingrove lord hughes lord mackie of benshie and to the other noble lords who have taken part <e> <s> my noble friend lord selkirk has taken a great interest in the bill and has contributed to its improvement <e> <s> i must not forget that my noble friends lord stodart of leaston and lord drumalbyn have also taken an interest <e> <s> last but by no means least i should like to <e>", "<cs> my lords for the reason that i have just explained that if the level of rents is adequate there will be more money available to the local authority to use on the housing stock <e> <s> it seems very obvious to me <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be able to judge whether or not the assertion that the noble lord has made about my knowledge of the law is correct <e> <s> as regards the present system the result of dissatisfaction with the level of rents is as the noble lord has said to reduce the capital allocation <e> <s> as i understood it that is what he said what i am saving is that that is not satisfactory because the result of that is <e>", "<cs> my lords exactly <e> <s> that is precisely why we want to change the system <e> <s> the noble lord is hard to satisfy <e> <s> he is discontented with the present system and he wants to object to any way of improving it <e> <s> it is fairly obvious that this is an improvement on the line that i am suggesting <e>", "<cs> well my lords that would be a matter of impression <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have no difficulty in having that word in writing but one has to take the way in which the assessors express themselves as sometimes requiring a little consideration <e> <s> the points that the assessors have made i regard as i said as well worthy of consideration but it often happens that when people who have been accustomed to one system are faced with a change <e> <s> they have a little difficult in accepting the change some people say that about the legal profession <e> <s> whether it is so or not i do not need to pause to inquire but the situation is that the assessors are faced with quite important changes <e> <s> they do not regard it quite as just dealing with the fringes <e> <s> they regard these as quite <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be easy for me to speak about a particular case <e> <s> may i say very generally as i have just said that there may be two reasons for a store like marks and spencer in glasgow paying higher rates than their corresponding premises in london <e> <s> the first woud be that the rate poundage in glasgow is higher than in london <e> <s> that is what the first part of the bill is attempting to deal with to cut down excessive expenditure <e>", "<cs> unfortunately it is not easy to be certain how the parliamentary timetable will operate <e> <s> in order to be strictly accurate about it i fear that this amendment is necessary <e> <s> indeed there is a convention of which the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey will be aware that it is not normal to refer in a bill of this kind to a bill which has not yet had its second reading in the second house <e> <s> but if consolidations are to operate reasonably accurately and effectively i think it is necessary in this case to make this provision <e> <s> as i have said all of these amendments have been approved by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> lord brightman as chairman of the joint committee and as far as i can see it is necessary for strict accuracy to do that <e> <s> as matters stand at the moment the mental health scotland act is not yet in force <e>", "<cs> this amendment certainly raises an interesting matter <e> <s> first i think it has to be borne in mind that the right which normally arises on a revaluation the right to appeal against the revaluation figure is in respect of the new one which is inserted as a result of the revaluation <e> <s> secondly i am glad to say that it is really only because revaluations have been postponed <e> <s> the noble lord said that this was the first time <e> <s> i think there was a postponement before on the reorganisation of local government because the revaluation was due if i remember rightly in and it was postponed to <e> <s> it was due again in as the noble lord said and it was postponed <e> <s> but i believe that the remedy if possible is to avoid postponement and to have regular revaluations unless there is some good reason to the contrary <e>", "<cs> this clause refers to the lands tribunal <e> <s> it is one of the improvements that we are proposing in the scottish valuation appeal system to enable the lands tribunal for scotland to adjudicate as the tribunal of first instance in certain appeals <e> <s> of course as the noble lord is well aware the lands tribunal for scotland is a judicial type of tribunal and therefore we assume that if it were to give a decision it would be a reasoned judgment <e> <s> for that reason this phrase was not put in the bill <e>", "<cs> this is a power which is precedented in legislation of a technical character for the purpose of giving full effect to a new provision in primary legislation <e> <s> we have examined the primary legislation and i sincerely hope that this power will never require to be exercised <e> <s> but in a complicated <e>", "<cs> again this is a matter of interest and importance that the noble lord has raised <e> <s> the system that we have sought to set up under this clause is that the lands tribunal will have power to determine any appeal or complaint under the valuation act referred to it by a valuation appeal committee in other words the parties go to the valuation appeal committee in the ordinary way and then it is for the valuation appeal committee to decide on looking at the matter whether it is a sufficiently important case or technical case to be referred to a rather more specialised tribunal <e> <s> the noble lord will see on line on page of the bill <e>", "<cs> the situation here is that as the noble lord said in the light of the then current scottish legislation a decision was taken on the lines tht he has described but those who are interested in these matters have felt that there was no particular reason why that should be the situation in scotland while a different situation existed in england and wales <e> <s> it is not so much a question of as it were opting for decisions taken south of the border rather than north of the border but it looked to my right honourable friend the secretary of state to be reasonable that the scottish person interested in the site of a static caravan should have this option if he wished to exercise it <e>", "<cs> the words that the noble lord seeks by this amendment to have deleted are words that seek to ensure that the new provisions relate to exactly the same caravan sites and pitches as the definition in section of the act that is to say a caravan site which is treated as a single unit of lands and heritages and the caravan pitches defined in the new section a in clause of the bill <e> <s> if we do not have a precise link between these two new anomalies might be introduced <e> <s> the words which the noble lord seeks to delete remove any doubt as to what caravan sites and pitches are referred to and i hope the noble lord in the light of that will feel able to agree that these words are better left in <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has said when one removes anomalies what one does generally speaking in this situation is to relocate the total burden <e> <s> this type of removal of anomaly is no different from the rest to which earlier the noble lord so eloquently drew attention <e> <s> the proposed percentage is which i understand to be the same as in england and wales <e> <s> i am afraid that at this moment <e>", "<cs> that is why i ventured to doubt whether the global figure was of much significance <e> <s> i understand that the global figure is of the order of <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to centre point <e> <s> the situation there was that the property was kept empty and in this way rates were avoided in order to get in effect capital appreciation on the value of the property <e> <s> the proposal before the committee is not intended to create any difficulties of that kind <e> <s> this brings me to the second point <e> <s> the discretion to give this relief and the judgment of whether or not the property is to be unoccupied for a short time only is for the local authority to exercise <e> <s> the rating authority has that discretion given to it <e> <s> the noble lord will see in the opening words of the new clause <e>", "<cs> the point about election rooms if i have understood it correctly is that if you occupy property for any part of the rating year you create the possibility of a liability for that year <e> <s> i think that is the point to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> the correct solution to that depends on the existing provisions <e> <s> the situation is that if you give say a short occupation of a property which is generally unoccupied in view of the statutory provisions you put the person concerned in risk of paying rates for much more than the short period for which he is actually using the property <e> <s> but this provision is not really dealing with the same problem as that <e> <s> i hope that is a sufficient answer to the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of marnock explained to us very clearly earlier on that when you make any deduction from one persons valuation you are in effect adding a burden on to somebody else <e> <s> therefore you must be very careful about the principles on which you proceed in order not to damage the fairness of the system <e> <s> i personally have a house in which we have a central heating system which is reflected in the valuation <e> <s> therefore i can well appreciate the sentiments that have been so clearly expressed from different parts of the house but i would have to say that your lordships must bear in mind what are the principles of rating valuation <e> <s> they are that you have to consider what a tenant would pay by way of rent for the house which is the subject of valuation if it is a house <e>", "<cs> i have heard it said that there is no colder place than edinburgh <e> <s> i do not know whether or not that is true <e> <s> i am not suggesting that it is necessarily true but it is very difficult to make variations according to the part of the country in which one lives <e> <s> of course the point is that the rating system the valuation system is primarily for dividing the burden of expenditure in a particular region and on the whole the difference between regions from the point of view of climatic conditions is not as great as between say extreme parts of the whole country <e>", "<cs> there are two problems which fall to be distinguished the problem of how you <e>", "<cs> at the moment he will be assessed on the value of the shooting <e> <s> but he will not be assessed on the value of the shootings in these circumstances if this amendment is passed because these shootings are not let <e> <s> he has people with him staying in his house who enjoy the shooting along with him but he has not let the shootings <e> <s> therefore in terms of this amendment these shootings will escape valuation altogether <e> <s> the noble viscount is right <e> <s> they could be assessed and that is what happens now <e> <s> i am saying that if the amendment is passed they would cease to be assessed and it seems to me to be manifestly unfair to introduce a greater anomaly into the scottish system itself than the amendment would remove between the scottish and the english systems <e>", "<cs> very briefly what i am seeking to point out is the difficulty in principle over the type of amendment which the noble lady is proposing <e> <s> i have not been able to think of any way of removing the anomaly which this amendment introduces <e> <s> parliament thought of it in and i have not been able to improve on that in the time since then <e>", "<cs> it is amazing what the years can tell us <e>", "<cs> think the best that i can do is to say that i shall draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the speeches that have been made this evening <e>", "<cs> i can understand that people in the northern islands might wonder how for example clause has affected the situation of particular subjects <e> <s> it is very difficult for me to do more than say that if there are no comparable subjects in england and wales they have nothing to fear <e> <s> if there are comparable subjects in england and wales they might then be compared with them <e> <s> i do not understand that this amendment really draws attention to any particular point that would be of much use one way or the other <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has suggested that although we are dealing with amendment no <e> <s> we should take account of the amendments which both he and i have proposed in relation to clause and speak together to them <e> <s> the noble lady lady saltoun has indicated that she does not intend to move amendment no <e> <s> c a drafting amendment <e> <s> therefore i shall not take account of it but will seek to take account of all the other amendments which have been put down to the clause <e>", "<cs> we have had an opportunity to consider these provisions in the ordinary way <e> <s> they are not in the nature of being temporary provisions <e> <s> in the governments view a provision of the kind proposed in the amendment would be extremely exceptional in this type of legislation <e> <s> we believe that the legislation is satisfactory as permanent legislation for the reasons which have been explained to your lordships at the various stages of the bill <e> <s> i certainly could not accept the proposals in this amendment on behalf of the government <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will feel able not to press his amendment <e>"]
