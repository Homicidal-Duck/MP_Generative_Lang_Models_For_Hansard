["<cs> my lords most of us have very happy memories of a childhood visit to the zoo and i am no exception in that respect but i think it particularly appropriate that today i should be making my maiden speech on this bill since on my first visit to london i came specifically to see the zoo <e> <s> many other people might say exactly the same but few will have travelled miles to do so <e> <s> in my mother embarked on what was then a very long sea voyage from australia and she was persuaded to bring the two youngest of her large family with her so that we could see the newly-opened penguin pool in regents park zoo <e> <s> on the way back to australia we visited every zoo <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak very briefly because the amendment of the noble lord lord avebury worries me to the extent that it would stop dead at the end of the next generation <e> <s> as an old australian i know that the patriality laws work very strongly against someone like myself who has been australian for too many generations in terms of immigration <e> <s> i make that comparison because i do not think anything that cuts off sharp at that point is good <e> <s> but in some ways there is great merit in the amendment <e> <s> if the noble lord had instead put his amendment forward in such a way that it replaced paragraph <e>", "<cs> a point which i think has not been taken fully into account here is that this nationality bill was to be of great help to immigrants to this country in so far as at the moment people like myself are not entitled to take jobs in the eec without a special type of work permit <e> <s> many immigrants have now said to me how very pleased they would be because under the bill they will have full nationality rights and have open access to the eec and employment there <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat concerned listening to the debate <e> <s> i think that very real anxieties have been raised about the mother who is at home and does not have the opportunity to pick up the language <e> <s> in the whole time that we have been considering these matters we have been adopting the attitude that everyone settled in the country at the <e>", "<cs> i am really torn two ways in listening to the debate on this amendment because i think the point that is being made that everyone would automatically become a british citizen as described is an interesting one but i want to raise rather the reverse point with the minister and i should like him to consider this point in the context of the amendment <e> <s> of those who are quite legally settled here there may be a number i have people who come and speak to me about this who do not particularly wish to become british citizens and in fact they are rather concerned as to what will happen to them if they do not elect within five years to become a british citizen <e> <s> therefore i am asking the minister to clarify this point and to make it clear to people <e> <s> i think the point raised by the noble lord lord avebury about the worries that people have at the present time is very real <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the previous administration of the greater london council passed plans for a lorry ban in the northern part of london <e> <s> that all costs to implement this ban had already been met and all notices were ready to be unveiled and that this experimental lorry ban which would have been of great benefit in establishing whether lorries and heavy vehicles could be kept to major roads only was cancelled by the present administration with the loss of those funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give me further information on how this relates in real terms and also how it compares with the rate of inflation since this government came to office <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could ask a further question of the noble lord <e> <s> how would this compare to average cost increases for motorists <e> <s> would it be in line with that or would it be better <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> may i emphasise my concern particularly over the one in the isle of dogs <e> <s> can he comment on whether he believes that the present labour glcs legalistic opposition to the whole idea of the enterprise zone in london has prevented progress of that scheme as i believe it is the one that the noble lord mentioned as being not off the ground yet <e> <s> this scheme being so important to london and any delay in it possibly affecting the docklands redevelopment does the noble lord think that the glc under its present administration is opposing this or does he think that any opposition is futile and that it is progressing in spite of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister for one further comment <e> <s> i know that he has covered this subject very much in the last few days <e> <s> is there yet any way of assessing how many jobs will be created through the enterprise zones <e> <s> also is there any mechanism for interchange of ideas so that each zone may benefit from the experience gained in other zones <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord the minister comment on whether or not he is aware that the small firms are kept very strictly to the p per day luncheon voucher while many larger firms give vouchers greatly in excess of that to their employees <e> <s> although this is meant to be declared and one is meant to pay tax on an amount above a weekly total of p every person of whom i have asked this question and i have been following the matter for some time tells me that in the big companies it is just more or less lost and in the smaller companies it is strictly enforced as a precise amount of p per day <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to commence by congratulating the noble viscount lord mackintosh of halifax on his maiden speech although i as one of the dental members here have of course been given great additional material as to why i would want other items to be sold on a sunday rather than just confectionery <e> <s> i wish to support the bill most strongly because of the direct personal experience that i have had living in bayswater in london <e> <s> i moved recently but i lived there and brought my children up there over many years <e> <s> this was the area in which the very first department store in london opened its doors whiteleys was world famous and historic <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord ardwick for his remarks <e> <s> the noble lord lord allen who spoke earlier said that all large shops will open on the basis that the noble lord has suggested namely that they would simply be forced to do so on a competitive basis <e> <s> i think that this point has been answered repeatedly <e> <s> i have just answered it myself in terms of the fact that the john lewis partnership do not open on saturday afternoons <e> <s> so i think that it is quite untrue to think that they would all open <e> <s> even now although there is six-day opening in the west-end of london not every shop is open six days a week <e> <s> if one looks at the shopping pattern on saturdays one will see that not all shops are open <e> <s> therefore i am afraid that i cannot accept the point made by the noble lord that people would feel obliged to open because competition would insist that they did so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure <e>", "<cs> my lords lady lane-fox has asked me to ask the question standing in her name as she is recovering from viral flu in hospital <e> <s> so it is at her request that i beg leave to ask the question standing in her name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> will he confirm that this is a benefit which specifically excludes married women and that when this scheme was extended in by the present government to include any person caring for another requiring full-time care that the only people omitted were married women <e> <s> will he also confirm that this was based on the belief that married women were on the whole available full-time and were not normally in employment <e> <s> will he also confirm that he is aware that we have the highest employment rate of married women in western europe currently something above per cent <e> <s> of married women of employable age <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend therefore agree that the impact would really be considerably less than the million because with all those people receiving supplementary benefit that amount would be offset <e> <s> alternative estimates on this suggest that the cost may be less than half the amount my noble friend has quoted <e> <s> will my noble friend also confirm his figures to me perhaps on another occasion <e> <s> because my own inquiries have revealed that a married man who gives up work to look after a relative who is an invalid would receive plus for his wife if she was dependent upon him and for each child <e> <s> these figures are somewhat at variance with the figures which my noble friend has just quoted <e>", "<cs> i am somewha worried by the amendment in particular because i happen to be a member of the glc <e> <s> at present p means over million <e> <s> as i listened to other speakers describing the small amount which would be raised by p in their areas i realised that we are facing quite different situations <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank those who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i have greatly appreciated their contributions which have been very wide-ranging and which have taught me a great deal about other cities i knew little of <e> <s> i also thank the minister for a comprehensive and detailed reply <e> <s> i appreciate his comments and i am grateful to him for mentioning the amount the glc has done to provide open spaces <e> <s> i would only add that apart from open spaces on the land they have done a great deal to encourage water facilities and recreation on the thames and canals of london and those are not to be overlooked <e> <s> again i thank the minister and i am most grateful because he covered almost all the points raised in the debate <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply would he confirm that he is aware that the power which enables the glc to spend this money is provided under section of the local government act which enables the expenditure of a p rate product to be put to this use <e> <s> would he also confirm that in the case of the glc this amounts to approximately million <e> <s> can the minister tell me whether other authorities in the country receive the same amount of money from a p rate or whether the expenditure available of million for this purpose is unique <e> <s> and in particular in view of the ministers recent consultative paper on local authority aid to industry which would limit the spending under section to areas of greatest need can the minister inform us when there will be a decision on that point and whether he will consider placing a ceiling upon expenditure of say million or a p rate as at the moment it is such an unlimited amount <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of my noble friends comment that pump priming is desirable would he say that the cost of million estimated for setting up the bureaucratic machinery to operate the gleb in its first year comes within that category of pump priming without creating an additional job at that price <e>", "<cs> may i support the retention of the clause as it stands <e> <s> many people in this chamber do not appreciate that in some local authorities at the moment there is such a threat to democracy that the auditor is the only person left to guard the public interest <e> <s> i believe that this clause covers that point <e> <s> i take the point made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington that it may not be fair to ask accountants to define the public interest but i do not think we have ever had quite such a <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend the minister for his reply i wonder whether he can tell us what proportion of the expenditure goes on wages and salaries and will he also comment on the cost in terms of wasted and lost resources apart from the very considerable human anxiety and suffering which may result from todays industrial action <e> <s> what will be the loss to the health service in terms of unused resources today <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister confirm that when the pay policy which has been referred to was in force the review bodies recommendations at that time for people working in the health service were actually set aside and not implemented <e> <s> can he tell me in how many years those review body recommendations have not been honoured and will he say whether he is considering setting up a nurses review body <e>", "<cs> my lords i would ask the minister to answer the other part of the question concerning the failure of various governments to implement review body recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> i should like to follow up the point he made and i know that he also made it in his reply to a similar question on th may <e>", "<cs> my lords as an inner london magistrate i spend quite a large slice of my time in the court dealing with fixed penalty offences and all magistrates sitting in these inner london courts consider dealing with such cases a terrible waste of court time <e> <s> for that reason i welcome the improvements that will come about through this bill <e> <s> very frequently the court receives a letter from someone saying i did not really do this the sort of half-hearted half guilty/half not guilty letter <e> <s> the court feels obliged to write back in each case saying you may have a defence and if you wish to defend please attend <e> <s> that case is then held over until yet another date and when that date comes the person does not come and probably sends no second letter either <e> <s> very rarely does the person concerned actually come in and defend the case because he genuinely did not understand that he had a defence <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he will confirm that there is quite a difference between the physical standard or structural standard of touring caravans and those of caravans which are permanently in one position <e> <s> can he also inform me whether there are any restrictions whatsoever upon the condition of caravans in peoples back gardens <e> <s> i am not referring to the parks which have been mentioned so specifically but perhaps the greatest eyesore is the single caravan rusting away and long discarded in peoples own yards in the country <e>", "<cs> i am really not at all convinced that the amount that my noble friend the minister has quoted is sufficient <e> <s> i appreciate that in my amendment i am perhaps asking too much when i ask for so much per day as i have noticed that the government do not seem to like these per day amounts <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend the minister would look at this matter again and perhaps i could bring forward a further amendment at report stage <e> <s> if he is willing to look at this again i would withdraw my amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> so far as i can see the only difference is that one uses capital letters for rent book and the other uses small but perhaps i am missing some other subtlety that exists <e> <s> i am quite happy not to move amendment no <e> <s> but to move amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i think no <e> <s> a is quite self-explanatory and really should not require my going into it at this stage <e> <s> i believe that everyone would support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend confirm that in all consideration of health matters dentistry is also fully considered <e> <s> i must declare an interest here as an inner london practitioner <e> <s> would my noble friend confirm that medicine cannot be viewed separately from the other parts of the health service as regards primary care <e>", "<cs> my lords following up the questions that he has answered may i ask the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to clarify his answer to me as i did not quite understand when he said that anyone possessing a national health card has no evidence of entitlement to treatment <e> <s> i understood the reverse that there may be many more people entitled to treatment than those possessing a national health card <e> <s> is he saying that national health cards are issued to people not entitled to treatment <e> <s> can he amplify the point as to when they are issued <e>", "<cs> it is important that we retain the essence of being able to remove the vehicle <e> <s> i have spoken on this issue in detail before and i do not propose to delay the committee on it now <e> <s> i oppose amendment no <e> <s> and therefore no <e>", "<cs> i too should like to comment on the amendment and like the noble lord lord underhill i tend to support the noble lord lord lucas on it <e> <s> there are a couple of points that should be raised so that they can be considered by the government <e> <s> if the wording <e>", "<cs> i should like to intervene at this point since i too welcome what was said about the disabled badge though i did not speak on it so as to save time <e> <s> i think that some confusion is arising <e>", "<cs> at the moment it is possible to leave a car on a parking meter for the whole day for <e>", "<cs> i think that the phrase city of westminster may be slightly too limiting although i personally know that the city of west <e>", "<cs> i make no apology for speaking at some length on this <e> <s> i have listened absolutely dumbfounded to the most amazing emotional outbursts on the subject <e> <s> i loved the golden words flowing from the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> he almost converts me until i stop and listen to what he is saying <e> <s> he is really saying no more sense than anyone else is saying on this topic <e> <s> i must take up a number of issues <e> <s> such a number of inaccurate statements have been made and alarmist issues raised <e> <s> let me take the bomb scare and the terrible fires <e>", "<cs> i would not claim that but i claim to know as much about it as those who have been speaking at length <e> <s> i know a little about the fire brigade system for i have until a short time ago served on the fire brigade committee for this capital <e> <s> in the event of all these fires and bomb scares the fire brigade are well equipped with keys to either special fire gates or other types of entry <e> <s> i have no doubt that they would be equipped in the same way with a key to unlock this type of device if it was a problem <e>", "<cs> apparently people have not followed this debate from the previous discussion that we had on it because i explained all this on that occasion <e> <s> i shall do so again if people have missed the point <e> <s> the reason why i feel it essential to have the double part of the clause in one which enabled you to immobilise the vehicle in the position that it was in another to move it is that there may be circumstances where it is wished to move it <e> <s> at the present time if a car has to be moved for any reason those same electronic lock problems occur whether the car has to be moved to the car pound or anywhere else <e> <s> that situation is no different in either case <e> <s> indeed you would be more pleased to find that your car had only been moved just around the corner rather than to a remote car pound <e> <s> i have no doubt of that <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but we seem to be at cross purposes <e> <s> the cars now moved to the pound are not opened in order to move them they are simply hoisted and taken on a large vehicle to the pound <e> <s> they are not opened and driven there except in a very small number of cases where the police would happen to have a key <e> <s> the vast majority of cars now are mechanically hoisted and taken away <e> <s> but parked cars in certain positions are great offenders <e> <s> it takes time and a lot of expense to bring the vehicle to take a car away <e>", "<cs> no i am afraid that i cannot give those figures <e> <s> i can tell the committee from my experience sitting in court that the only people who are at all concerned about parking offences are those who have had the personal inconvenience of having had their vehicle removed or immobilised and the immobilisation would work in the same way to great personal inconvenience <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow up the point made by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> there is a parallel with the charges made for dental services <e> <s> in no way i understand will it ever be possible to give people all dentures entirely free <e> <s> there are people who do not come into the categories listed here and who manage reasonably well on the basic pension which they receive but who would find that a sudden charge for dentures or in this case might be too much for them <e> <s> there is a special application form for both dental and medical services <e> <s> an application can be made to the department of health and social security specifically for a payment to meet either optical or dental charges <e> <s> i should have thought that a similar provision would be appropriate for this category <e> <s> it seems that it may already be covered by the words in subsection of the amendment <e> <s> the secretary of state for social services could introduce some type of application form which would require various questions to be answered <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether this <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to the last question is my noble friend the minister aware that although superb accommodation is provided in some places the amount charged even after the proposed increase will still be far below anything that could be available to anyone in london <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i would thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> could he confirm that it is very hard to differentiate between emergency and non-emergency cases and that in many cases the patient is to be admitted for investigation of a condition which may appear non-emergency but may very well be emergency <e> <s> did the noble lord see the report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> in view of the chancellors statement earlier this week on job sharing which is to come into force in january may i ask him whether it is possible that this has an effect on the numbers of to -year-olds seeking full-time education and could the minister assure me that the government will see that these groups have no obstacles placed in their way of continuing in part-time education <e> <s> could he also assure me that he is aware that there is a changing world in employment and that many skills are now needed to be learned skills such as communications which are not job-specific but would relate to many jobs and would increase the employment prospects of that age group <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for bringing this bill before us and i too must declare my interest as a practising dentist <e> <s> i find the bill most interesting <e> <s> there are some points in it that i think are excellent and there are other points of minor worry that i should like to raise <e>", "<cs> i speak against the acceptance of schedule in particular with regard to part ii <e> <s> i have been asked to make a number of points by the conservative medical society which is concerned about the totally new structure proposed for the family practitioner committees <e> <s> the society is not happy that the chairman will be appointed <e> <s> i was not able to support the amendment of the noble lord lord banks because his amendment started after the matter of the chairman <e> <s> as i understood it his amendment commenced with the vice-chairman <e> <s> the society is not happy because it considers that the past tradition of family practitioner committees where the chairmanship alternated between a professional and a lay member is a system that has operated very well and happily for many years <e> <s> it is rather a pity to throw it out and to superimpose possibly a completely outside person on a very localised and well-knit local family practitioner committee which it would normally be <e> <s> i ask the minister to consider that point <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak very briefly since i think that a slight misconception arose in the speech of the noble baroness when she referred to funding <e> <s> the amendment is not actually asking for funding and if it comes through in that way the minister may be more inclined to turn it down <e> <s> it is asking for the power to provide funding <e> <s> this means that the minister could actually decide about the question of funding and which units were to be funded afterwards <e> <s> all that we are pressing tonight is for the power to have this facility <e> <s> i appreciate that in the form of the postgraduate hospitals there are certain specially designated hospitals that are national hospitals already <e> <s> this is really to cover in particular the small units within the present ordinary health structure within the district health authorities which are being swallowed up because as i know from having served on health authorities myself they are reluctant to spend any money on people who live outside their own area it is the national element which is important <e> <s> we are asking here only for the power to provide the funds <e> <s> i cannot imagine why the government would refuse to have those powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the minister although i am quite surprised to find myself in agreement with him <e> <s> on the last occasion i spoke on this point i made many of the points that have been made this evening <e> <s> even then i plumped for the non-appointment of both chairman and vice-chairman <e> <s> i still think that that is the way it should be and that neither of these people should be appointed <e> <s> they should be elected from the committees as in the previous way which is a method that has worked so well <e> <s> if however the secretary of state intends to appoint the chairman the way that the minister has put forward is perfectly logical and that he should appoint the vice-chairman <e> <s> reluctantly therefore i feel i have to support the minister on this in a way that is quite contrary to my previous views <e> <s> if i could persuade him to have both the chairman and vice-chairman elected from within the committee traditionally in the way that has existed as the noble lord lord winstanley said since long before and certainly since the days when i served on a executive council i would still wish to press him for that but i do not like this amendment which just goes for a vice-chairman who is not appointed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble baroness lady masham in this amendment <e> <s> there are a few points that have been raised on which i should like to comment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady robson commented on the number of special health authorities that have been set up <e> <s> it is quite true that this government have created seven special health authorities which are all post-graduate teaching hospitals and very much on a national basis <e> <s> by so doing this government have surely recognised that there are national needs and provided facilities for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness lady robson for those comments <e> <s> when one is sitting as an ordinary member of a district health authority one is constantly told that whatever happens to be the little specialty within your area it is the one that you should not go on financing because you are financing that for patients who do not live in your area and are not ratepayers in your area <e> <s> this battle goes on all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether this is the appropriate place at which to raise this point but it certainly comes under schedule <e> <s> whether or not it relates to this particular amendment perhaps the noble minister will tell me <e> <s> i am concerned that what is said about suspension of registration is appropriate only to doctors and not to dentists <e> <s> i would ask the minister to ensure that eventually dentists are also included at an appropriate point <e> <s> i wondered whether this current amendment covered the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take up this point about publishing charges and to put the other case <e> <s> i do not really support the amendment about a general basis for calculating charges being published by local authorities as it may have exactly the reverse effect to that hoped for by the noble lord <e> <s> i fear that publishing how charges are calculated which would certainly not be a simple or easily understood document would rather deter people from applying because they might misinterpret the listing as set out by the local authority and think it isnt worth my while applying because i will not get help <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow up the speech made by the noble baroness <e> <s> i questioned earlier and i now question again under this amendment of hers the need for this subsection at all <e> <s> i think the whole issue of abandonment of assets has come up due to pettiness and jealousies that have arisen <e> <s> the person who goes in and has no funds of any sort does not have to meet any charge the person who has ample funds meets the charge <e> <s> in my experience those who have been found to divest themselves of assets are those who have had a small amount of savings and who have felt that they would like to give them to someone either a relation to help them in their life or to some other person <e> <s> it seems to me there is a whole lot of jealousy and envy that has created the pressures that have brought the government to bring this forward on what is really a very minor matter <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow up that last point <e> <s> although i accept the statement that it is a responsibility unwelcome to the general dental council i think that it is a tragic state of affairs because the general dental council are the body who should be responsible for making these decisions within the profession <e> <s> however let me make it clear that i am not in any way asking them to take an individual case decision or a decision per case <e> <s> we must remember that we get a dentists bill only once every years and within the next years the younger section of the profession will have reached the point where they will be holding the elected places and possibly even the nominated academic places on the general dental council they may be more willing to take the decisions for their profession and the pressure may be on from within the profession <e> <s> it would be wrong for the minister to rule out that possibility <e>", "<cs> if i am entitled to ask the minister for further comment i should like to ask him to explain how it is that all these other nations which are so much at risk in all the european countries and indeed most other countries where dentists are calling themselves doctors have decided to face this danger and this great risk to the public to which he referred <e> <s> i would appreciate some comment on that point <e> <s> i would also press again the point made by my noble friend that even at the moment if a dental surgeon has a doctorate of for example engineering or music he is not allowed to put that on his notepaper although he has a doctorate and he is entitled in every other respect to be called doctor <e> <s> i would appreciate a reply from the minister on those two points <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances does the minister think that the patients in this country are any less bright and capable of appreciating the same points <e>", "<cs> i am rather pleased that the editor of the <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise with the minister the situation of these people who would be suspended <e> <s> according to the bill people who would be suspended would be treated as not being registered in the register <e> <s> this concerns me because it means that from the moment of summary suspension which i agree is necessary for the protection of the public or would be necessary in such cases as it was used that person would be prejudged in that he would be virtually losing his registration <e>", "<cs> the minister says that this is not a summary procedure <e> <s> the sidenote to the amendment says <e>", "<cs> having listened carefully to what my noble friend said in reply i must say that i had not appreciated and was sorry to hear him say that suspension is virtually the same as erasure apart from the fact that after a fixed period of time one is reinstated instead of having to appear again before the general dental council for reinstatement <e> <s> i think the profession would find it a more valuable weapon if it were more equivalent to a conditional discharge in court which i thought was what the government had in mind in relation to suspension <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the point my noble friend makes <e> <s> i was not aware of it and i was interested to learn it <e> <s> it is important for dentists to realise that it is the intention that suspension will lose you all your rights both of employment and to employ others <e> <s> that being so i am slightly puzzled in view of the correspondence i have had with the minister about another measure in which i was informed such a provision would be introduced <e> <s> was that not going to do precisely what this amendment proposes <e> <s> if so i cannot see how it could be permitted in one measure and not in another <e> <s> i shall discuss the matter further with the minister because there seems to be some confusion over this but i am grateful to him for clarifying the severity of suspension <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should simply like to welcome this amendment and support it <e> <s> i think it goes a very long way towards solving problems that i discussed on the earlier suspension amendment <e> <s> i appreciate the ministers having brought this amendment forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this bill which will remove the uncertainty of financial planning for london transport <e> <s> i shall speak mainly on the london aspect as i am a member of the great london council <e> <s> i remember clearly the impact that the fares fair policy had on my constituents and the shock caused by the proposed supplementary rate levy of p in the pound to meet fares fair <e> <s> i have here a letter from a constituent dated th october which was just at the time when the fares fair and supplementary rate came in <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point of the noble lord lord mishcon and i thank him for it <e> <s> i am quoting that committee because i happen to be a serving member <e> <s> the chairman of the finance committee congratulated that committee on being a freer of funds <e> <s> that is the chairman who is responsible for deciding what monies are given to london transport executive <e> <s> that is the relevance of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is important in terms of the remarks of other speakers earlier in this debate upon the autonomy and democracy of the elected local government system to realise that although the number of members is to on that authority all committees are on a ratio of seven to three or seven to four <e> <s> that destroys the argument that local government is working on a fairly democratic basis <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend and my lords i assure the house that i have not much more to say <e> <s> i shall not name him if the noble lord lord mishcon would rather i did not but a different estate agent has published a research survey showing the change in the ratio of rents to rates <e> <s> whereas in westminster in the rates were only per cent <e> <s> of rents they are now per cent and in islington whereas they were per cent <e> <s> in they are now per cent <e> <s> which is an increase of more than three times <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord the minister spoke to all these amendments together i am not sure whether my comments relate more directly to amendment no <e> <s> or amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i would make the comment at this point <e> <s> i am still somewhat concerned that the amendment moved by the minister does not really take into consideration the case of the dentist who is suspended on disciplinary grounds in such a way that he is immediately and summarily suspended <e> <s> i am concerned for his practice for his patients <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister considers it necessary or would give some thought as to whether he considers it necessary for the general dental council or the health service authority or some other body to have the right to ensure that those patients are not suddenly left stranded without a dentist because the practice is wound up or sold off or disposed of in some way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand the wording of the amendment <e> <s> is it suggested that by the words or the authority the advice of the authority should be taken rather than the advice of the secretary of state <e> <s> i take the point made by the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead that it might be necessary to have the comments or political advice of the authority because that is an elected body and has a view to give <e> <s> however the amendment proposes that the executive should take into account any advice given by the secretary of state or the authority <e> <s> therefore it seems to me that the executive is being asked to take the advice of the authority but to rule out the advice of the secretary of state <e> <s> on those grounds i find the amendment to be slightly puzzling and i should appreciate a comment on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am slightly puzzled by the comments that have just been made by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> he seemed to imply that if an authority is elected not just on one point of policy then that gives that authority an automatic mandate <e> <s> it was quite apparent in the case of the fares fair scheme that in london the people who elected the authority were quite stunned when they found that they were getting a supplementary rate demand <e> <s> that was when all the letters started flowing in protesting on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always fascinated to listen to the noble lord lord molloy because he does have an understanding of the unemployed in the town from which he comes <e> <s> but for him to say that one cannot look at a single unemployed man and for him then to press a bill lumping all unemployed together as if their needs were in all cases exactly the same and that this concession should apply to everyone is something that i cannot accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord molloy for his explanation but it does not interfere with my point <e> <s> i do not believe that one can take the unemployed as a mass and put them all together and say these people in general and <e>", "<cs> i am making a point about the transport executive and this whole bill is related to the moves which are made by the transport executive <e> <s> where is one to stop these concessions <e> <s> the classification of the unemployed is extremely difficult to assess <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord molloy in his statement about older people and he mentioned people from the th army so obviously he meant the older section of the community and i know from my own patients that this is the hardest and saddest situation for people who have been made redundant and yet who are not old enough to retire <e> <s> i hope at a later stage that the government might look sympathetically at doing something to help those people <e> <s> as i see it there is little or no possibility of those people ever getting jobs again but they are quite different from the people at the other end the young ones who definitely can and should be able to get jobs certainly in this part of england and as matters improve i hope everywhere else too <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a very fascinating speech by the noble lord lord houghton and to listen to his personal experience of building societies has really been quite an education to me <e> <s> i should like to begin my comments by taking the final sentence of the speech of the noble lord lord young of dartington his remark that the building societies are one of the most important institutions in this country <e> <s> i think that is highly significant and i am surprised in a way that we have so few people taking part in this debate tonight <e> <s> i think that can only be because this is the very beginning of this topic and tonight we are airing it for the very first time <e> <s> i have no doubt that when it gets to the point that legislation comes forward we will have very wide interest shown not only in this chamber but throughout the country in the changes which should be made in building societies in their constitutions and in their powers <e>", "<cs> i would ask for clarification from the minister as to whether this clause would cover the people of dulwich who are so keen to buy their homes there are there whose freehold is owned by a charity or whether they would come under clause <e> <s> to clarify the position the property is owned by southwark council and these people would have a right to buy under the housing act but for the fact that the ground is owned by a charity <e> <s> i understand that the charity would have been willing to negotiate but southwark council does not wish people to have the right <e> <s> i wonder whether their position would be covered by clause or clause <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e>", "<cs> may i return to the point that i raised on clause and ask the minister whether anything in this amendment or this clause helps these people <e> <s> i return to this point because there are over people involved <e> <s> i refer to where the charity which owns the land is willing to enter into negotiations but the council which owns the lease not i emphasise the charity or housing association refuses to negotiate deliberately to thwart those who wish to buy their own council homes <e> <s> is there anything in this clause that will help those people <e> <s> i am not speaking about a case where a charity is unwilling but about a case where it is willing to part with the land and where the intervening landlord the council refuses to honour the wishes of the people <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the general principle behind the question of caring for the carer <e> <s> that is important <e> <s> but i am not entirely happy with this amendment in the form that it takes <e> <s> if a local authority has a long waiting list they are often desperately in need of this accommodation <e> <s> my own experience on a local authority has been of single people surviving parents in usually a flat as the area i was associated with had virtually no houses and occupying a flat for which thousands of families must have been waiting <e> <s> in these circumstances the local authority must have the right to rehouse such people in a much smaller unit a one-person unit if they are on their own <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lady lane-fox <e> <s> it is wrong that disabled people should be discriminated against when it comes to the right to buy <e> <s> it should also be appreciated that not all disabled people live in buildings which were originally designed for the disabled <e> <s> very large numbers of people live in adapted dwellings <e> <s> the adaptations make those dwellings easily usable by anybody <e> <s> if there have been highly specialised adaptations and a dwelling is purchased by the person living in it the next person to buy that dwelling would take into account those special adaptations <e> <s> it is logical that the dwelling would be sold to someone with a similar disability <e>", "<cs> i was interested in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw the attention of the committee to the common practice in australia in these circumstances <e> <s> if the purchase proceeds to completion the benefit of the interest is given to the purchaser <e> <s> if however the purchaser withdraws from his wish to buy then the interest is given to the person who has lost the sale <e> <s> if this matter is to be considered perhaps an arrangement of that kind might be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware of the situation in bruce house a common lodging house in the city of westminster where the council although it had for years spent more and more money on upgrading it was faced with such unreasonable demands from the socialist opposition that all the former occupants of that place had to be put out <e> <s> moreover is the noble lord aware that the regional authority which is socialist controlled would not agree to any rebuilding or improvements which would bring the house back into use and help homeless people <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to oppose the amendment the sentiments that have been put forward sound very impressive and very environmentally conscious but they fail to appreciate exactly the environmental situation at the vast waste disposal station at edmonton which is now the place from which the greater london council generates its electricity from waste <e> <s> in order to produce sufficient refuse to incinerate to produce enough electricity there has to be an enterprise of vast size <e> <s> from the local environmental point of view it brings in great numbers of heavy and noisy vehicles which have to queue up in order to tip their waste into the great bays that are provided <e> <s> anyone living in the edmonton area and i must say that i represent a seat not far from there on the greater london council is rather grateful to hear that the greater london council considers that the cost of producing the electricity and of running the station means that probably nothing of its type will ever be constructed again <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great interest to the points that have been made and in due course i should like to reply on one point in particular <e> <s> this has been a good debate and this matter is of a kind which we in this house are i believe very well placed to tackle <e> <s> despite all the excitement of recent weeks it is not a party political issue as the noble lord lord winstanley said any more than the national association of citizens advice bureaux is a political organisation <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord winstanley pointed out it raises some very important general questions on government relations with grant-aided organisations and i think that we must consider those <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to correct my statement and say inner london <e> <s> the noble lord is i believe correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to comment briefly on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i welcome this part of the bill in so far as it is necessary to have the right of immediate suspension in cases where the public might genuinely be considered to be at risk pending the hearing of a criminal case <e> <s> i seek an assurance from the minister that the practice of any general dental practitioner who is suspended prior to any hearing would be protected and that he would not lose in any way if later he was found to be not guilty of the charges and not deserving of any disciplinary action <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister able to tell us whether he believes that some of these long-term vacancies are in areas where there is a very small waiting list and where there is really an over-supply of accommodation <e> <s> this is a complex problem and i ask the minister to consider the point that in some areas there is a great shortage of council accommodation while in others there is already an over-supply <e>", "<cs> my lords although it is already well known in your lordships house that i am an elected member of the greater london council <e> <s> i would begin formally by declaring an interest <e> <s> i am now in my th year of service on that

changed that they have to return here <e> <s> do they then receive the full pension rate or a pension in any way related to that which they were receiving while abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when the housing function was transferred from the greater london council to the boroughs the only way in which agreement could be reached with the staff in this matter was to upgrade almost all who were being transferred to the boroughs but that the boroughs then found it a most costly exercise to receive staff being paid at a higher rate <e> <s> can he inform me what type of attitude he would take as regards this because he must have either staff agreement or redundancies and either would prove costly <e>", "<cs> my lords in the original answer which the minister gave he said that local government which followed government guidelines would have its own rights and controls and not have its independence diminished <e> <s> is he aware that as regards the guidelines laid down not only by the last government but by a previous government those local authorities who followed the guidelines and who did curtail their expenditure were disadvantaged as opposed to those who did not curb their exenditure in any way and who then found that later they had much more fat to cut than the good councils who were penalised much more <e> <s> will he take that into account when he starts to rearrange finances at a later date <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lady sits down perhaps i could just take up the matter of the people <e> <s> apparently the calculation is not very simple because it is not just the amount paid to them but also the amount of administrative staff that would have to be taken on by the dhss to deal with them and a number of other factors come into it <e> <s> i have not had time to check the noble ladys arithmetic on my calculator i am afraid i would not be able to do it in my head but apart from that it is not a simple mathematical calculation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell me whether any special action is being taken to inform dental and medical practioners of precautions that they should take <e> <s> i understand that it is quite possible that a carrier could come into a surgery and that the dentist the doctor or another patient could become infected <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his earlier reply but may i ask him whether it is now believed that this disease is transmissible in many more ways than was originally believed <e> <s> will the minister issue instructions to practioners or ask his department to look into the need to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> would he inform me whether he is aware of the disastrous effect that this so-called registration of rent is having within the london area in that it is keeping many properties vacant which would otherwise be available to needy tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister confirm that the rent act was the cause of a great many people british people in particular being unable to obtain accommodation in london today <e> <s> if as i believe the noble lord will confirm this would he tell us whether there is any likelihood of some action being taken to change the situation whereby those few in tenancies have secure rights but any other young british person requiring a tenancy has no hope of getting one and all the accommodation on offer today is on offer to foreigners <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to take back to the department the suggestion that action be taken under the housing act section <e> <s> is the minister aware that that section was the section implemented to remove the control on shorthold tenancies as a requirement of the rent officer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he saw the article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have put down my name to speak on this topic simply

london enterprise board has created only jobs at a cost of <e> <s> that i do not consider an economical use of londons money nor do i consider a grant to the black lesbian society as being a good use of section money <e> <s> i could go through similar grants for your lordships <e> <s> i believe that the ratepayers of london are not satisfied that their money is being wisely spent and that is why there is a demand for the government to take what i think is unfortunately a most necessary action to control the rate expenditure in london <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister assure us that any land in the green belt which is considered to be surplus to requirements will still remain carefully controlled and protected as part of the green belt <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord plant for giving us the opportunity to debate this topic tonight <e> <s> i find it very difficult to follow the noble viscount lord st davids because i think there is

canal basins in london something that really must be commended <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me whether he is aware that every drop of water consumed in this house has been used at

committee of the department of health over many years has commended to the government the introduction of fluoride into water <e> <s> finally can my noble friend confirm that he is aware and here i

whether the per cent <e> <s> reduction in lead in the petrol in will reduce the hazard to fruits and vegetables grown within a certain distance of traffic pollution at the present time or whether it will still remain a hazard and that advice should still be given to people to wash all fruit and vegetables because of the dangers <e> <s> if he does not know the scientific answer on this at this stage will he see that sufficient <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for his reply <e> <s> i would ask him whether he has seen the report in <e>", "<cs> my lords last month i had the privilege of attending with the noble lord lord wallace of coslany a meeting of the council of europe on the subject of health which was held in paris <e> <s> it is indeed a fact as the noble baroness lady robson mentioned earlier that all western european countries are experiencing difficulty in providing and maintaining their health services at present <e> <s> most of those present agreed that there was need for one visible responsible person to whom those who wished to find out something about the health service or had some complaint could take their case <e> <s> i think that is a point i shall go into further later <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to comment following her reply to the noble baroness lady birk with regard to a review of the british nationality act whether in due course she would have the government look at the matter of charges which i understand are now amounting to a large profit for those people applying for nationality <e>

lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> regrettably he did not differentiate between and <e>

that in the past two years in particular the rate precept has risen at an alarming rate and has caused difficulty and even hardship to residential ratepayers and actual damage to business and industry

for debate today <e> <s> i listened carefully to what he said and i noticed that his view was that unsuitable properties should be cleared as rapidly as possible <e> <s> the noble baroness lady denington held this same view <e> <s> i have a slight reservation on that in that i was a candidate in blackburn where i saw those acres of desolation where all the properties had been cleared and

to my speech <e> <s> my comment was that i did not intend to discuss the structural defects of industrialised building not that i was unaware of them <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend clarify for me whether this housing benefit applies to privately rented or local authority property and if to both whether she is aware of the proposal put forward by sheffield city council of their intent artificially to increase the rents to the poorest tenants in order to be able to manipulate the scheme and achieve extra benefit for their own city council at the expense of other people in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend assure me that although she cannot comment on particular cases the government do take the view that housing benefit is to help those in real need and that any schemes deliberately arranged to manipulate this benefit for the benefit of those not in real need will be carefully looked into by the government and efforts made to control them <e>", "<cs>

which is certainly involving cut-hacks in training <e> <s> there is an over-supply of general dental practitioners in training is there also an over-supply of general medical practitioners <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend assure me that when the secretary of state looks at the matter of early retirement for medical practitioners he will also look at this same matter in relation to dental optical pharmaceutical and all general practitioners who come under the general practitioner scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that there has been considerable help for the poorer people mentioned by the noble lord <e> <s> lord molloy in particular in the reduction of standing charges for those who are consuming only small quantities of gas and electricity <e> <s> will the minister confirm that in that regard there has been a marked improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that he is aware of the fact that some residents associations such as the knightsbridge association have already made their judgment and thoroughly commend the scheme which has made their streets tolerable and livable <e> <s> will my noble friend also confirm that under the legislation there is no cause for a vehicle to be left in an obstructing position <e> <s> the legislation permits it to be moved to a less obstructing position where it may be clamped <e> <s> will my noble friend give some thought to erecting signs to indicate that a particular area is a clamping area <e>", "<cs> my lords i find these amendments rather strange and i really hope that the noble lord the minister thinks very seriously before he accepts them <e> <s> i appreciate absolutely the intentions of the noble baroness lady denington and i am sure her motives are good but i am not really happy with the wording here <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister confirm that in some areas unemployment is largely a matter of mismatch between skills and jobs and that these educational opportunities may help people in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend inform me whether similar consultations are continuing with australia in view of previous answers given in this house that there are even more people in this category in australia than in canada <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to welcome this statement which i think all of the members on my side at county

to oppose this amendment and i think this is a particularly appropri-ate moment at which to do so in view of the contribution just made by the noble baroness lady fisher <e> <s> this may appear an

getting warmer but i had to leave the chamber because it was so cold and most other lady members found the same <e> <s> i apologise for not being here when the noble lord lord graham was originally discussing enfield i understand he mentioned me <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment not because i have any doubt about its acceptability to the committee but because this seems to be the appropriate moment to record on behalf of the dental profession how pleased we are that this consolidation bill is making such rapid progress and how great a help it will be both to the general dental council which at present is working under the two previous acts and finding that a very complex and arduous job and also to the members of the profession who will themselves be able to understand this

information would be kept from him if it was in the authoritys interests to prove its case <e> <s> i cannot go along with the amendment at all <e>", "<cs> i cannot support this amendment and i should like to explain why <e> <s> the noble lords have spoken on this point <e> <s> lord graham has just mentioned how the situation has changed in hackney <e> <s> the situation has certainly changed very dramatically in hackney and very much for the worse due to the extravagance of the authority there <e> <s> my surgery is in islington <e> <s> my catchment area of patients is hackney <e> <s> for years

thank the minister <e> <s> i am delighted <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord beloff for giving us the opportunity to debate this subject today <e> <s> it is an interesting title and it is always worth listening to my noble friend lord beloff who introduced the subject so clearly <e> <s> my own comments are much more prosaic but i believe equally relevant to the subject as i am convinced that the right to buy for council tenants has meant a great increase in freedom for the individual <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord and i made exactly the same point myself they are definitely acquiring responsibility <e> <s> but many people are seeking that responsibility because with responsibility comes the freedom of choice which they do not have when they remain a tenant <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord has my speech and that of my noble friend lady carnegy of lour confused <e> <s> i made no remarks of the type the noble lord has mentioned whereas my noble friend did say exactly what the noble lord said she would not have said <e>", "<cs> i rise to support clause of the bill <e> <s> if i did not support this bill so strongly i should not be here today <e> <s> after the tedious times i have sat through greater london council meetings this afternoon was going to be one of those joyous occasions when her majesty was opening the thames barrier which of course has been paid for to the extent of over three-quarters by the government <e> <s> it would have been a joy to be there <e> <s> it is only because i so strongly support the government in this bill that i have given up my seat there today to be here and to vote in favour of clause <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> i was well aware of that because she said so but i thought she was supporting the view herself <e> <s> the ratepayer has no protection through the ballot box and i was surprised that the noble baroness lady fisher did not understand this point when it was clearly made by my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> only per cent <e> <s> of those voting in local authority elections pay full rates <e> <s> that was the point he was making <e> <s> he was not in any way discussing who would or would not have a right to vote he was saying that of those voting only per cent <e> <s> had an interest in the financial expenditure situation <e> <s> the remaining per cent <e> <s> were very happily voting to spend someone elses money which is rather different <e> <s> then per cent <e> <s> of the total rate bill is paid by the business sector which of course has no votes <e> <s> we therefore reach the situation and this is the point that has been made so many times throughout the debates on this bill that there is no direct connection between those who have the right to vote and those who pay the bills <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way <e> <s> i too have received a copy of that letter <e> <s> i consider it a most interesting and scurrilous way of taking two entirely separate paragraphs of my speech putting them together in a way that happened to suit and trying to distort the image completely <e> <s> this committee is too well aware of the situation and noble lords who have read <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady macleod has asked me to speak for her on this amendment on which i also speak for myself <e> <s> as the noble lord lord graham said we have received a copy of the letter from enfield <e> <s> it is strange how this authority keeps coming back into our debates <e> <s> there are a few points in the letter that the noble lord has overlooked <e> <s> first it makes clear that consultation is already wider than will be demanded by this bill <e> <s> he will find that that is so in any well-managed local authority <e> <s> there is already wide consultation <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord lord graham of edmonton whether he considers that the co-op would be covered as a commercial ratepayer <e> <s> i would have thought that it would be covered by the present wording in clause <e> <s> it seems that that is his major concern about the co-op <e> <s> i would also ask him to comment on the point made previously in the ministers reply about the phrase <e>", "<cs> i have a certain sympathy with this as i likewise have been contacted by the london electricity board and they have put their case very thoroughly to me <e> <s> but i think that this amendment is not so good as the second amendment which the noble lord has down because no <e> <s> c seems to be a much more simple formula <e> <s> i hope that the minister will take this away and look at it since it is a fairly complex matter <e> <s> if there is an injustice it should be looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether additional cost would have been involved in the leaving of the doctors and the termination of the employment of the to whom he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that in view of yesterdays debate wherein the opposition constantly requested central government not to interfere with local authority decisions this is a strange example where they are asking for the reverse action to be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that she is speaking simply about the basic pension and that for those in need there are considerable additional supplementary benefits and also considerable assistance in the form for example of national health treatment and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is a further complication for people in terms of national health treatment in that if they are in receipt of supplementary benefit they simply put a cross on the form and they are entitled to free treatment whereas if they are receiving the rent and rate rebates to which my noble friend referred then even under those circumstances they have to go through a great deal of additional paperwork although they would be in the same financial situation as a supplementary benefit recipient <e> <s> will my noble friend ask his department to look into that matter which is taking up a lot of unnecessary civil service time in administration <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat puzzled by the speech of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> i agree that we need people to be aware of what is going on in areas and to be local users but i understood that under the bill the london regional passengers committee would be representative of the consumer interest and would be the very people to provide this degree of information that is required by the board <e> <s> the most important thing whoever is appointed to the board i think it would happen automatically that a great number of people from london would be appointed is their administrative ability and their ability to run the transport service as an efficient industry in the interests of all those using it <e> <s> but the viewpoint of the person getting on and off the bus or tube each day would surely be expressed through the london regional passengers committee and for that reason i do not support this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to oppose the amendment perhaps more than anything because of the comment of the noble baroness lady masham that this amendment narrows to one the number of people who would actually be interested in this matter <e> <s> that is true <e> <s> it is not a good idea <e> <s> this should definitely be the responsibility of the whole corporation <e> <s> if one looks at london transport today one must realise that the situation of those with disabilities is very carefully considered <e> <s> there is the dial-a-ride scheme <e> <s> there has also been consideration given to kneeling buses which i have seen in new york <e> <s> when a button is pressed the step used for boarding the bus is lowered enabling a person with limited mobility to board <e> <s> all these matters have been considered <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness comment on whether she thinks that this lobby which is so satisfactory and successful now will cease to operate once the bill becomes an act <e>", "<cs> far be it from me ever to resist a challenge but sadly i cannot rise to this one as i have my own direct concern with clause <e> <s> i have been working on that while sitting here and i did not really listen to the noble lord lord mcintosh as perhaps i should have done <e> <s> i shall read his comments in <e>", "<cs> the reason why i have been concentrating so carefully on reading this clause and was not able to consider speaking on lord mcintoshs amendment was that his amendment was a starred one as the committee will realise <e> <s> therefore it meant that it had come in at quite a late stage <e> <s> this bill is complex and requires quite careful consideration <e> <s> but my reason for studying clause is that i consider this clause is not satisfactory in that it omits any reference to the power which i am convinced is essential to enable the transport authority to fulfil its obligations under this clause <e>", "<cs> may i come back to that point <e> <s> i do not think an identity card is essential as i think that you have the alternative of paying your surcharge immediately and then no identification of any type would be required <e> <s> it would only be required in the event of your being unwilling to pay or unable to pay and presumably that could then be dealt with in the same way as it is now by british rail if you do not have a ticket <e> <s> i regularly see people in court who have come through british rail <e>", "<cs> i think it is a very interesting point that the noble lord lord mcintosh has made but i am slightly puzzled when i try to reconcile the fact that the government wrote off all the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that these slightly varied but basically repetitive questions on the nuclear deterrent by the noble lord lord jenkins of putney not only take up an excessive amount of time of this house but are questions of an alarmist nature attempting to distort the defence situation and that they may actually be causing unnecessary anxiety to the members of the general public <e>", "<cs> i am slightly puzzled by this amendment as i cannot really see why the noble lord lord pitt thinks that the government should fund this directly <e> <s> in the early stages of the concessionary fares in london they were funded by the local boroughs and i wonder whether the glc abolition changes the situation <e> <s> if all these powers revert to the local boroughs i should have thought this would again become a local borough function as it was before <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that the national health dental service has since its inception been essentially a piece-work dental repair service and that such repairs have now reached the point where as was confirmed in a written reply on st december last over per cent <e> <s> of patients examined under the health service required no further treatment <e> <s> does he agree that that type of repair service is rapidly becoming inappropriate as the need for routine fillings is diminishing in the united kingdom and in all developed countries because natural teeth are being retained much longer <e> <s> does he also agree that in the future greater emphasis will need to be placed on maintaining oral health especially in older patients who would in former years have lost their teeth at an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to accept my evidence that there is under-employment <e> <s> i recently visited dentists in the inner london area <e> <s> most of them told me that they could take any patient the next day and quite a number of them that very day and that they were desperately under-employed <e> <s> i ask him to accept that as evidence which i have personally gathered <e> <s> i would also ask my noble friend whether he is able to reconcile the fact that as i say many dentists are in need of work and yet many of the people one meets say that they cannot get a national health dental appointment <e> <s> i would ask him how to reconcile those two facts <e> <s> finally i should like to ask him to comment on the dental strategy review body report <e>", "<cs> and that a new review should be undertaken <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that the first amendment as has been mentioned was so widely drawn <e> <s> it used the phrase non profit-making organisations <e> <s> that has now been refined down to specific bodies registered with the charities commission and that is a very good qualification <e>", "<cs> in that case my lords i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i must re-read the comments in question but i thought that i had been less specific than that <e> <s> in any event i support this amendment as i believe it would give local authorities the option to support the charities and through the use of charitable associations of the type which my noble friend has mentioned to multiply the benefit of the money that is made available in having work done by a great number of volunteers <e> <s> this is in itself a very cost-effective way of operating especially in the social services <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply and would confirm that in the / years of existence of the london transport passengers committee they have only times sought a direction from the glc and the glc i might add have never acceded to that request <e> <s> so it is rather a case of having a big stick to wave rather than actually being able to beat anyone with it <e> <s> nevertheless i think it is worth considering and i am very grateful to the minister for saying that he will read this matter later and consider it in great detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for her very helpful reply <e> <s> is she aware of the very great interest in this convention on the part of individuals and non-governmental organizations especially in the light of the world conference of the united nations decade of women to be held in nairobi in <e>", "<cs> my lords if one accepts as i do that the government have a clear mandate to abolish the glc and the metropolitan counties then i believe one must support this bill and oppose the reasoned amendment and i shall do so <e> <s> so many points have been made throughout this debate and i feel that even at this late hour i must correct some of the misapprehensions or misstatements that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend inform me whether any attention has been given to the comfort internally of these boots or whether like ladies shoes they are more for appearance than for anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak in two respects regarding this amendment <e> <s> the first is to take up the point that the noble lord lord somers has made as i do not think that he has quite understood the significance of this amendment <e> <s> it is not a question of a variation in the fares <e> <s> each borough as i understand it will meet the cost of the concessionary pass for the person entitled to have that pass <e> <s> in that way it will not matter what the fares are anywhere <e> <s> although as i understand it london regional transport would have their own fare structure the concessionary pass cost would surely be met by the boroughs as it used to be in past days <e> <s> i stand open to correction on that if i am wrong but do not think that lord somers point is exactly relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i am not able to support this amendment <e> <s> i have a number of reasons for saying that <e> <s> when i was chairman of the social services committee of westminster city council we issued these concessionary fare permits from the local boroughs <e> <s> that was before the scheme went over to the greater london council <e> <s> we issued the permits without charge and i always thought that that was a mistake we made <e> <s> we should have made some purely nominal charge such as p as i believe some other boroughs did charging p or in those days <e> <s> the reason i say that is because it came very clearly to my knowledge that a great many people took up those concessionary passes although they were quite unable to travel and never did travel <e> <s> indeed i remember clearly one case of a woman who said that she had taken it in case her chauffeur ever became ill and it would be convenient to have it <e> <s> a number of bedridden people applied for passes and got them <e> <s> we issued them and also in those days it will be remembered that there were no photographs on the passes so a pass issued to one person could have been used by anyone else <e> <s> however i shall not go into that aspect of it <e>", "<cs> my lords do i have the alternative of speaking separately to both amendments <e>", "<cs> i have to speak on both simultaneously <e> <s> thank you very much for that clarification <e> <s> in that case i shall deal with the amendment to the amendment first <e> <s> i have suggested a penalty fare of rather than for several reasons <e> <s> one was to bring it more into line with the penalty paid as a fixed penalty charge for car parking in the wrong spot <e> <s> i thought that was not an unreasonable sum <e> <s> i also thought that it was more of a deterrent than the proposed minimum <e> <s> but since putting this amendment down i have had consultations with london transport and i think i am persuaded by them that is a more practical figure at this initial stage <e> <s> their research has shown that people are much more likely to have on them and the real intention is to enable people to settle this matter then and there rather than to choose the -day deferred system for payment <e> <s> so i think as there is provision in my noble friends original clause for a variation of this amount should become completely out of date as time goes by i would not press my amendment to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is correct <e> <s> i thank the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a new requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness would permit me to interrupt her another reason why i dropped the fine is that if the penalty fare is not paid within the days and the present system is followed where the person is prosecuted it is rather a parallel to a car-parking fine where if you do not pay the fixed penalty you can be prosecuted the fine in court could be very much greater as it could be now <e> <s> i think the present maximum fine is <e> <s> there could be a much heavier penalty if someone did not pay <e> <s> this is really a lessening of the offence reducing it to a civil status but if they deliberately do not pay of course it will be a different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister to clarify whether this is a case of retrospection or whether that date was merely the date placed on the bill at the time it was published so that people therefore knew it was as from that date <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that the resource allocation working party which was transferring funds out of london was introduced by a labour government because of the departure from london of the central london resident population <e> <s> will he also confirm that the teaching hospitals are now having great difficulty in finding normal teaching material and that students have to go to peripheral hospitals to encounter ordinary cases <e>", "<cs> my lords can i ask my noble friend the minister this in view of the reports in the weekend newspapers of westland entering into agreement to make an australian aeroplane in britain would that produce a second british tender for them <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that work-sharing is of great importance to women who wish to carry on in careers and is quite a different matter from just part-time work in which many women find themselves not able to use their full skills and qualifications at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging reply <e> <s> do these improved figures indicate significantly increased expenditure on the national health service over that period or do they indicate simply a shift in resources <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister inform me whether a record is kept of fatalities due to solvent abuse including glue sniffing and if so whether he has figures available <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just ask the minister to clarify one point on this matter <e> <s> i know that when london transport was asked to allow stops to be used by the privately run yellow culture bus which we see going around town at the moment there was great resistance for a long time but in the end they agreed and they are allowing their stops to be so used <e> <s> the minister made the point that what is proposed is not intended to oppose any competition but will he assure me that it will not be so prejudiced in favour of london transport as to be at the expense of other operators <e> <s> i am strongly in favour of london transport but not if there is any risk to other operators <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords on first reading the amendment i thought that it only applied to paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not mean that <e> <s> i meant that as it is worded the amendment says <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps he would allow me to say this <e> <s> is it not possible that if any one borough insists on a standard not less than the minimum in the reserve scheme then automatically the situation would exist where the boroughs did not agree <e> <s> it requires only one in disagreement for the boroughs not to be agreeing and therefore we should be back to the reserve scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords again and i am sure that the noble lord lord underhill will expect it of me i rise to oppose this amendment <e> <s> i do not think that there should be a compulsion on local authorities to use the post office <e> <s> when we talk about that we imagine that we can use post office services for nothing <e> <s> however that is not so <e> <s> there is a charge for using the post office <e> <s> as time goes by we have no way of knowing how the post office might vary that charge <e> <s> councils may find that to use the post office might involve them in very major expense <e> <s> the fact that they have a choice means that they are in a stronger position to negotiate favourable terms with the post office than if under this amendment they are obliged to use the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like the benefit of the wisdom of the noble and learned lord lord denning on the words under paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to say so it was lord dennings legal view on this matter that i was seeking <e> <s> it was not a point that he went into in his contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil for bringing this subject for debate today <e> <s> i listened to the contributions of the other noble lords and the noble baroness lady burton with great interest <e> <s> my comments will be on the airports and on the need for greater co-operation and liaison among the various bodies directly involved for the benefit of what i consider is the essential ingredient in all this the passenger <e>", "<cs> i feel i must rise to speak at this point <e> <s> i did not hear the noble lord lord birkett declare an interest as an employee of the greater london council <e> <s> i think that would have been in order <e> <s> i also declare an interest as an elected member of the greater london council <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i thought that perhaps many people here today who had not been present on the previous occasion would not know of that and might have though differently about it <e>", "<cs> i find this to be a strange amendment and i cannot support it <e> <s> i consider that it is almost a case of reinstating the business ratepayer <e> <s> surely we have always based all local government ever since the elimination of the vote for the business person upon a resident population <e> <s> there is a very small resident population in the city <e> <s> i am very impressed by the way that the amendment has been moved and i have every respect for the city institutions but the amendment would throw out the whole pattern of this interim provisions bill <e> <s> i spoke earlier this afternoon on the point that it was just by chance that there would be more conservative people than labour people on the council because of the representation in the parliamentary constituencies <e>", "<cs> i accept that point and i know also although it is a much lesser number that there is a similarly huge influx of people every day into the city of westminster <e> <s> but still it will be only those who are resident in westminister who will be able to vote and have elected their member of parliament <e> <s> the same is true in the city <e> <s> the city member has been elected for the cities of london and westminster <e>", "<cs> again before the noble lord sits down and to keep him busy i presume that he is suggesting that in the usual city tradition this member would be an independent and therefore it would not change the political complexion <e> <s> as i mentioned earlier this is one of the difficulties of attacking the argument that the way the representatives appeared was fortuitous <e>", "<cs> i speak against the amendment <e> <s> those who think that this is an outrageous power to take are not correct <e> <s> they really do not understand how difficult it is at present to maintain a quorum at county hall <e> <s> hardly a meeting goes by without the quorum bell having to be rung <e> <s> i have known occasions under the present administration in the last few years when the business of the council has had to be adjourned for lack of a quorum <e> <s> if that situation exists now when we are supposed to be governing london well how much greater will be the risk if there is any attempt at deliberate obstruction afterwards <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her question <e> <s> i am not able to comment on those councils i have no direct personal experience <e> <s> but again i believe it is covered by subsection whereby if the opportunity was taken to make some alteration of the quorum in the metropolitan interim authorities it would have to be justified through the house at the time <e> <s> i do not therefore think that there is any danger in that <e>", "<cs> i believe that it is very much by design now because it is a deliberate way of attempting to prevent minority business being dealt with <e>", "<cs> in some ways i support my noble friend who has just spoken in that i oppose this very sweeping amendment <e> <s> but i am very concerned as to what the three words any advice given mean <e> <s> i would query those three words and i should like to know what the extent of that advice would be <e>", "<cs> my noble friend who has just spoken was probably speaking against the amendment rather than in favour of it <e> <s> i shall however leave it to him to clarify the point <e> <s> my noble friend seemed to be speaking in favour of the officers being obliged to provide information <e> <s> if so that is against the amendment rather than in favour of it <e> <s> i wish to speak strongly against the amendment <e> <s> i consider that the clause as drafted is essential to protect officers of the greater london council <e> <s> i think that at the present time they are under a clear instruction to supply no information whatever <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way i think that that is a point which i must dispute <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the point that i wish briefly to make is that there was no form of consensus whatever on the new amended plan and it has a very much greater political content than the previous greater london development plan <e> <s> that is why the minority party at county hall has objected very strongly to it <e> <s> that is one point which is of passing interest <e> <s> the other point which is of greater relevance is that if all these matters are to go to the borough surely the borough plans will be the more important <e>", "<cs> of course there already exists a greater london plan <e> <s> the subsection refers only to any alteration to it <e>", "<cs> i too would like to support this amendment <e> <s> i think in this debate we are losing sight of the fact that this is simply an interim provision that we are discussing <e> <s> this is simply to be for the one year which we believe it will take to complete the abolition of these authorities <e> <s> great reference has been made to the greater london enterprise board <e> <s> i was interested in the council agenda from last weeks greater london council meeting <e> <s> the report from the leader of the council he was discussing the activities of the greater london enterprise board said <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord i do not think it is fair to consider it in that sense <e> <s> the p rate is being diverted almost totally to the greater london enterprise board but people are believing that when we are talking about section we are talking about the voluntary bodies that are coming for the money <e> <s> on the whole the voluntary bodies are not getting the money under section and therefore they will not be as adversely affected as one would expect by this amendment <e> <s> if they are genuinely deserving causes i believe that they will get the money <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e> <s> i said that it was not succeeding in doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords in introducing this debate the noble lord lord wells-pestell said that it was not to be a party political knock-about but following lord molloy we know very well that it is nothing but that <e> <s> i must also take issue with the noble lord lord wells-pestell on his reference to a very arrogant prime minister and his comment on the callous indifference of the present prime ministers policies as i cannot accept those comments <e> <s> i believe the government care and are doing their best in their own way to deal with the problems that occur <e>", "<cs> bespoke tailoring yes <e> <s> everyone wants something off the peg now <e> <s> those people who had been made redundant knew that there was never any hope of their ever getting another job in that field because it was vanishing from under them <e> <s> the noble lord lord cockfield mentioned that one of our problems of unemployment is that compared to the united states we have not been sufficiently adaptable flexible and willing to learn new things and change over <e> <s> for older people it is very difficult but the young people should be looking to the new opportunities <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> i am talking about all the years which went on before that under the labour government when there was a pretty steady increase in inflation <e> <s> that was the time when every time i went to the shop i looked to see what the new price would be <e> <s> shops did not even put the prices on a lot of foodstuffs if you remember because they were going up so quickly they could hardly get the new price on before it had gone up <e> <s> that was the time when all those people were very hard hit <e> <s> i think they are at real risk <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i certainly did not wish to imply in any way that i do not think that there is a gap <e> <s> my statement was that the actual wording of the motion did not make clear whether we were dealing with it only in todays context or historically <e> <s> i considered that historically the gap had narrowed rather than widened but the rest of my contribution will be as in <e>", "<cs> i wish to take up the point made by the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> people find that these searches are distasteful <e> <s> none of us would wish unnecessary searches to he carried out <e> <s> nevertheless it is most important that the power for these searches should exist <e> <s> to that extent i support the amendments moved by the noble lord lord plant and the noble baroness lady masham of ilton <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment <e> <s> my reasons are probably different to those of many other of your lordships <e> <s> i very much deplore the change in regard to national health service opticians <e> <s> i do not like what the government are doing in terms of changing the opticians act <e> <s> however this amendment is one that i do go along with for the simple reason that it is very desirable as everyone says to have your eyes examined <e> <s> in a survey into how many people needed dental treatment and how many people then said that they would go but did not it was found that one-third never presented themselves for examination <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank those noble lords who have supported me in this amendment which as i have said from the beginning was a probing amendment <e> <s> however i was not very happy with the answer which i thought was rather woolly <e> <s> i think the points made by the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth about the statement made on the lives that women lead were exactly right <e> <s> whoever prepared that part of the statement was very out of touch with what is going on in the world <e> <s> that really stunned me <e> <s> i do not think the government appreciate the reaction of women to this sort of issue <e> <s> everyone accepts that there is not million available <e> <s> we would he prepared to sit back and wait for a very gradual even the most minimal move to see this situation gradually changing <e> <s> that is where i am rather disappointed <e> <s> i am also particularly disappointed that because the advice at the moment is there is no problem with the eec directive this government would sit back and wait until the court cases come in and then perhaps be forced to make a much more dramatic change than we could see now by a gradual introduction <e>", "<cs> my lords i felt listening to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton that his arguments were completely opposite to the arguments put forward earlier this afternoon when he was saying how important it was for us to have information on exactly what everything is going to cost and everything that is going to happen and how we must have all that before we have the bill <e> <s> now he is suggesting that all these parts of this bill which would give us that very information which would be helpful and would provide the answers he asked about earlier should be put aside <e> <s> that is one reason why i must oppose his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a question not of there being delay or no delay but of information <e> <s> earlier the noble lord was asking for audits on all kinds of accounts and for information to be produced <e> <s> i have been consistent in both i consider <e> <s> but it is not a question of delay as that was not the topic under discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that unless the government retain these powers in the present clause the worthwhile and deserving charities to which the noble earl lord longford referred would have great cause for concern because i believe that the presently constituted greater london council would spend its section money on all the less deserving causes quite deliberately in order to worry the more deserving causes <e> <s> this is what one has to be frightened of <e> <s> there has been a deliberate scaremongering tactic by the present glc to worry the genuine and highly thought of charities <e> <s> there is no cause for that alarm because i believe that this clause gives the government control over what the section money is spent on <e> <s> they will see that it is well spent in the genuine interests of those really deserving in london <e> <s> the danger is that unless this clause is there the money will instead be frittered away on far less deserving causes and the genuine charities will be left out <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i point out correcting the statement that was made that it was not another district that was referred to in the previous debate but another section referring to section <e> <s> that i <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can help because i also was slightly puzzled <e> <s> but as i understand it it would read <e>", "<cs> my lords it goes in at line of the long title <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord the minister whether in this matter there is any particular relationship in terms of areas in the same way as there is in perinatal deaths <e> <s> is there any particular known distribution or any factor of that type which might have an effect in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite concerned by this amendment and wish strongly to oppose it <e> <s> i think those who speak of the initiatives taken under section fail to realise that real jobs are not being created by for example the greater london enterprise board <e> <s> indeed all sorts of things are being done in the name of this so-called initiative <e> <s> only today it was decided by a committee that the coin street site a multi-million pound site should be given on a lease for to the coin street community builders and later they will be financed by the greater london enterprise board to buy the freehold and meet all the expenditure <e> <s> i think this is a quite ridiculous situation <e> <s> we all know that the creation of a long lease devalues a freehold to a low figure <e> <s> presumably that is being done so as to fit in with the financial limits that are provided further on in this bill <e> <s> it is a terribly bad thing when money that is supposedly being used for employment initiatives is just being taken from the ratepayers and thrown away in this haphazard fashion <e> <s> i oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be allowed to intervene i was speaking of real jobs not just jobs but real jobs that are to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to oppose the amendment <e> <s> grants have been handed out in some cases by the greater london council i am thinking particularly of the womens committee in such haste that no one has had time to consider where the money is going <e> <s> indeed there has been quite a detailed report recently on this subject <e> <s> although therefore i accept that this could cause some degree of delay i feel that whatever the grounds that are given it is public money that is involved and this should be handled well <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk mentioned that local authorities would be unable to give anything <e> <s> i understand that section in respect of other normal local authorities is not affected at all <e>", "<cs> my lords we are getting slightly lost in this amendment <e> <s> it is not a case where the greater london council for example is a social services authority or a health authority <e> <s> it has no social services responsibility <e> <s> therefore the grants that go to those bodies at the present moment go under a discretion but are not necessarily the responsibility of that council and we all know that <e> <s> the danger is that if the pattern were continued in the way that the noble lord lord evans suggests it would perpetuate the present handout of grants there <e> <s> entirely putting aside the controversial items about which i have spoken so often i do not think it is a good thing for bodies to receive money automatically because they received it last year and the year before that <e> <s> that is not a sufficiently good reason <e> <s> as i mentioned earlier in my own experience of local councils we scrutinised every grant every year to see which recipients had become more in need and deserving and which had become less so <e> <s> but this provision would perpetuate a system whereby anyone who already had a foot in the door was all right and no one else could possibly receive any money after that <e> <s> even on those grounds it is not right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only sorry that the bill and the controls will not come into effect until it receives royal assent <e> <s> i am sorry that todays date is not inserted instead of the phrase the passing of the act <e> <s> for that reason i very strongly oppose the amendment of the noble baroness lady birk which quite clearly seeks to delay the controls <e>", "<cs> today <e>", "<cs> my lords when disposing of an interest in land one should also take into account the disposal of a lease of land <e> <s> earlier this afternoon i referred to the coin street site which in was valued at million but which is probably now worth about million <e> <s> i mentioned that that land had been leased for years for a rent of <e> <s> that property would not be caught because it would be well under the mentioned in this amendment <e> <s> it is an absolutely classic and immediate example of how a very important site could be disposed of though at the moment only as a leasehold property <e> <s> but that so devalues the freehold that the freehold would be saleable for almost a nominal sum if somebody had a years lease for almost no rent <e> <s> there are many ways therefore in which very dangerous procedures would be opened up <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer which satisfies me <e> <s> on those grounds i am pleased to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether we have any breakdown of which countries the visitors come from and whether there has been a substantial change in recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to comment briefly <e> <s> i had not intended to do so but in view of the previous contribution i feel as a magistrate that i must speak <e> <s> the situation as described by my noble friend is perfectly all right if one is asked for an order while sitting in court and expert advice is available <e> <s> however frequently this sort of request is made at home at night when it can be extremely difficult <e> <s> certainly i would not find that i could satisfy myself on all the points that the noble and learned lord lord denning put forward <e> <s> it is after hours when the expert advice is not available that the problem arises <e> <s> for that reason i must say that i am very much swayed by the comments of the noble and learned lord lord denning <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he will convey to the civil service our very high regard for the work that they do and can he inform me whether he thinks there is any loss of morale because quite often they seem to be under public attack <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have added my name to that of the noble baroness lady masham on the amendment i too should like formally to support it <e> <s> i think that everything has been said <e> <s> i emphasise the deterrent effect that i think this power would exercise <e> <s> in particular the noble earl lord attlee was very brave to make the statements that he did which bring home to us how people would feel <e> <s> i support the point that the searches must be conducted by suitably qualified people <e> <s> on the point about the necessary clinical conditions some police stations are large enough to have quite good clinical conditions <e> <s> if that is so there is no reason why the search could not be at a police station <e> <s> it would depend purely on the standard of the facility available <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether there will be an opportunity for parliament to scrutinise these proposals directly <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend inform me whether any records are kept of the number of job opportunities or job offers that are given to people who are unemployed or whether we are to presume that these people have not had job offers <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble minister aware that even when the lifts and moving staircases are in order there are still grave disadvantages for travellers arriving at heathrow with either personal wheels in the form of a wheelchair or wheels for luggage if there is no way they can get off the underground system without steps <e> <s> at heathrow they are given no warning that if they get on to the underground which they can easily do at heathrow these hazards will await them at the other end wherever it is <e> <s> could the noble lord ask london transport to look into some system whereby passengers could get off more easily with luggage in london because this brings a lot of money to the capital <e>", "<cs> my lords often enough in this chamber your lordships have heard me say things that were not very nice about the greater london council but on this occasion i intend to speak well about them because i strongly support what they have done and are doing in the reclamation of waste <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i was unable to be present in the house when the noble baroness lady birk commenced moving this amendment <e> <s> unfortunately i was at a meeting of the greater london council which is continuing at this very minute <e> <s> i was sorry to have to leave because i lost the opportunity of voting against the majority party and the vote was just coming up <e> <s> but i came because i consider this issue is very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> as i understand it this order brings into force the local government interim provisions act and therefore this order is all about the act <e> <s> is that not correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house <e> <s> obviously spending my time at county hall and doing battle on other issues i have not had time to study that <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will give way i have just received a message <e>", "<cs> my lords if the money for these sewerage works is provided by the water authorities may i ask my noble friend how it comes that there is such a vast difference in different parts of london whereby prudent councils such as westminster have a rolling programme and regular sewerage maintenance while other councils other local authorities in london have let their sewers deteriorate to the point of danger <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that the whole purpose of the reorganisation of the health service in setting up district health authorities was to enable these bodies who work close to the ground in these areas to make these important decisions <e> <s> if the government intervene directly on all these matters it would become a centralisation measure <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that it is rather confusing when we receive our bills to see them described as being for water rates <e> <s> this tends to make one think that they are like a local authority rate <e> <s> would it not be better to change the terminology <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that some passengers arriving late at heathrow due to delayed flights have no opportunity of using the air-bus <e> <s> they are obliged to use the tube only as the bus services stop quite early at about oclock <e> <s> is the noble lord also aware that in using the tube even if passengers manage to get on at heathrow there is no way whatsoever of their getting off without inconvenience <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that in some cases it is better not to make progress in particular on the unit pricing of foodstuffs which our euro-committee here is finding would not be to the consumers advantage <e> <s> is it not better that something unfavourable is not implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords my thanks go to the noble lord lord renton for giving us this opportunity to debate the most interesting and very undervalued subject of civil defence and the responsibilities of central and local authorities for it <e> <s> i shall concentrate my contribution mainly on civil defence in london with only general reference elsewhere <e> <s> i wish to illustrate how in spite of the law the hard left has successfully thwarted the intentions of parliament for nearly four years and is continuing to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that i was more knowledgeable than anyone else <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that a return on capital is required in all other authorities such as the electricity and gas undertakings can the minister inform me why this situation is different <e> <s> in those other cases consumers are paying in relation to their consumption but in the case of water they are paying purely in relation to their rateable value unless they happen to have a metered supply <e> <s> but not everyone is entitled to a metered supply <e> <s> why is there that difference in the equation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take that point up further with the minister <e> <s> is he aware that that does not apply to all premises <e> <s> i must declare an interest as i have a dental surgery and i was refused the right to a metered supply <e> <s> i think that this applies only to certain domestic premises <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the past many social services committees of local authorities have considered this question and in most cases have decided against such a scheme because there is no way in which one can really determine who is a pensionable person living entirely alone and so not attracting benefit for other people <e> <s> it is really not practical to consider this for persons of pensionable age <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord henderson for bringing forward this topic for debate this afternoon and i should like to support him <e> <s> i am pleased to be speaking immediately after the noble earl lord longford because i found it quite laughable that he was determined to give all credit to his party for every good social service and of course i do not for one minute accept that <e> <s> i have seen the work done by conservatives throughout the country so many times tht i cannot accept that for one moment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the money given by this country to the voluntary fund for women set up by the decade for women has been given without strings and really is of great benefit to the people receiving it and gives benefit to those in this country in that we are helping the poorest to help themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the bill and have been asked to do so by the london boroughs association <e> <s> from my own personal knowledge of living in the centre of london i have seen these applications and these changes in the skyline as blocks of flats have acquired a new top floor <e> <s> i know the problems that have been caused for local residents <e> <s> indeed these permissions have almost always been granted on the grounds that it would be too expensive for the council to refuse them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that to many of the noble members of this house the central post office is a very important link in the delivery of mail as that is the place where we obtain our stamps <e> <s> will he assure us that as a result of all the recent work studies the rumours of early closure are unfounded <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister confirm that there are many other heart units in london and that the government recently gave a major grant for the rebuilding of the national heart and the brompton heart and chest hospitals <e> <s> would he also confirm that as between hospitals in london and those throughout the country there are big differences in the cost of heart operations and the cost-effectiveness of these units <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister think this is an adequate protection to meet the present under-employment of doctors and dentists or does he think as i do that this is only a small drop in the ocean <e> <s> as an elected member of the general dental council of course i welcome the restriction on free entry because we are educating dentists who cannot get employment in this country <e> <s> but does he not think that it is time we looked at the other end of the scale much more thoroughly and encouraged those doctors who are well over retiring age to retire and indeed to consider the early retirement of some general dental practitioners <e>", "<cs> my lords again before the noble lord sits down is it not possible that that water could have had some other harmful product in it equally well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should begin by declaring a non-interest in the bill <e> <s> as a dentist this is going to do me out of business and therefore i of all people should be opposing it <e> <s> indeed i suspect that those dentists to whom the noble lord lord monson referred as an increasing number who are opposing the bill might be connected with the fall-off in demand for dentistry generally and particularly with the new charges now coming in <e> <s> i am therefore sorry to hear that my colleagues are losing their great care for the public because of their worry about their own pockets if there is not enough dental business <e> <s> so i definitely declare a non-interest in that the bill is opposed to my financial interests <e> <s> nevertheless i think it is the right thing to do and for that reason i strongly support the government on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i will reply to that by saying that i believe those decisions to reverse fluoridation there were not based on dental or health grounds but simply on that same element of freedom of choice <e> <s> i would mention also that there was an earlier experiment in scotland where fluoride was introduced in a certain local authority area by the free choice of the elected members <e> <s> dental decay fell by per cent <e> <s> there was a change in control of that council and they removed it from the water <e> <s> caries went up by per cent <e> <s> few people would accept that they could have their lives played around with to that extent to be given something beneficial and good and then see it taken away <e> <s> but that proves conclusively that it did have this beneficial effect dentally <e> <s> it also makes the point that for various political reasons such as the civil liberties arguments advanced tonight people do make decisions to take the fluoride out <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady trumpington on her new post <e> <s> i should like to reverse the line of speech of the noble baroness lady robson because i intend briefly to comment upon her subject of hospital charges and then go at much greater length into the dental aspect <e> <s> i was very interested when the noble baroness referred to the charges for private patients in nhs hospitals because i am still a member of a special health authority <e> <s> i understand that our health authority which happens to cover the national heart hospital is specially bracketed at a high level <e> <s> at the meeting the other night i thought the figure of a day was quoted <e>", "<cs> my lords people were not particularly unhappy about the charge of a day although i am very aware of the point the noble baroness makes that one wants a room of first quality for that price <e> <s> although the hospitals are pleased that they are now able to charge more a few years ago the charges were so low that we had a constant influx of foreign visitors because it was so inexpensive to come now hospital treatment is a more realistically priced item their concern at the moment is that you pay the same no matter what treatment you are having <e> <s> if you come in for major heart surgery you are still getting quite a bargain at a day because that is all in there are no extras whatsoever <e>", "<cs> it is even more difficult this time <e> <s> last time it was per cent <e> <s> and most people <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose the amendment and support the bill <e> <s> i believe that functions and responsibilities should be genuinely local in local government <e> <s> i have found in my own constituency and i speak as a glc member that there has been very much a big brother element <e> <s> traffic management schemes have insisted that a pedestrian crossing is sited where the glc think is right even though all the old people still continue to cross where they have always crossed and where they asked for the crossing to be in the first place <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene at this late stage on this amendment but the noble lord lord energlyn and i recently spent a considerable time looking at all these statistics <e> <s> he said to me that the only common thing with all these people in the west midlands is the water <e> <s> i asked what about the air <e> <s> are they not all breathing the same air <e> <s> this is very true <e> <s> there is no way of identifying any of those medical conditions particulary with the water or with the fluoride in it <e> <s> indeed some of the statistics he gave showed a very similar pattern in the north-west <e> <s> but in the way that clever people do when they want to use statistics he showed me only the statistics that suited his argument best <e> <s> you need to have the whole lot in front of you before you can consider this and i certainly do not think that the statistics prove anything <e>", "<cs> we should also like to know how that is balanced against the savings in health care so that we know the net cost <e> <s> what are the savings to the taxpayer as opposed to the cost to the ratepayer <e> <s> my noble friend on the front bench will have to be something of a financial genius to come up with an answer <e>", "<cs> this seems the appropriate moment to mention that every drop of water we drink in this house has been used seven times before <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may also mention that at one time in scotland where an elected body turned this into a political issue they reversed the introduction of fluoride <e> <s> as a result of a political decision by the local authority fluoride was already in the water <e> <s> there was change of political power and immediately that decision was reversed <e> <s> then there was a further change of power and the water system was changed yet again <e> <s> to turn the whole matter of fluoridation into a political football would be of no benefit to anyone because it would mean that the whole issue would be coming and going <e> <s> people may not realise that it is not a political issue that is borne out very clearly here tonight <e> <s> yet when local authorities have had the power of decision it has become a political issue <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply to that point because the noble lord is quite wrong in saying that i speak for the dental profession <e> <s> i am a dental surgeon practising in my own profession and in that sense yes i am speaking for them <e> <s> but i must make it clear that i am in no way speaking as a representative of the dental profession <e> <s> i should also like to make it very clear that far from having an interest i have an absolute non-interest <e> <s> it is very much against my financial interest to add fluoride to the water because that does me out of business <e>", "<cs> i wish to oppose this amendment because the very statement made by my noble friend a few minutes ago was that these powers already exist under the act <e> <s> if that is so there is no reason in the world to repeat them here <e>", "<cs> this amendment is simply in order to try to worry people <e> <s> the noble earl lord kinnoull said that this is an emotive issue and <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend the minister replies i should like to say that there is a certain mischievous element in the wording of this amendment and particularly in the comments made by the noble lord lord sandys who said that he is delighted that the noble lord lord houghton has emphasised the poisonous nature of the substance <e> <s> as was emphasised in a reply already given from the front bench this is not a situation applying to a diluted substance <e> <s> most of the substances used in the purification of water are extremely toxic in their undiluted form <e> <s> i have pointed out previously in this chamber that every drop of water that we drink in the house has been used seven times before <e> <s> i can assure noble lords that they would not drink the water if it had not been treated with these chemicals <e>", "<cs> i think that this is typical of many situations and is in fact the way that the law operates in this country <e> <s> bills eventually become acts people believe that they have certain rights but when it comes to a test case it is found that that is not necessarily so <e> <s> there is a classic example about which i have just put down a question <e> <s> a court has just found that an owner-occupier who lets his home when he goes abroad will not be able to get it hack again <e> <s> no one would want to leave that situation as it is <e> <s> i hope that the government will change it <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the point that it would be good to have consultations with the elected local authority <e> <s> i am very much for elected authorities particularly at local level <e> <s> however there seems to be a misunderstanding about the actual wording of this amendment <e> <s> i hope that when the minister brings back an amendment it will be a better one <e>", "<cs> i certainly support this amendment and i think that all this talk about needing two months thinking time is quite unnecessary <e> <s> this is simply an amendment to ensure that those authorities presently fluoridating their water will be acting legally that much more quickly <e> <s> we have had considerable debate in the committee and the minister has told us that she will be bringing back an amendment to allow adequate public consultation <e> <s> my experience of public consultation is that anything under two months would be totally impossible and that two years are more likely to be needed for public consultation <e> <s> so that all this alarm at the thought that every authority is going to go rushing through a fluoridation of water scheme within two months is quite unnecessary <e> <s> i support the amendment as it stands <e>", "<cs> i should like to say that my comments come purely from the fact that i have served on health authorities for a good many years and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady lockwood for bringing this debate to the house today <e> <s> i have a particular interest in speaking on the subject as i am the united kingdom representative to the united nations status of women commission <e> <s> in that capacity i see much of the situation how things are for women in this country and how their position compares with that of women in the world in general <e> <s> whatever problems we have here we have to realise that they are as nothing compared to the problems of many women in the developing countries <e>", "<cs> i wish to oppose this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord graham has said there is already a very adequate consultative machinery there <e> <s> any suggestion of having public inquiries at the drop of a hat which this amendment would do would do nothing but place a dead hand on the progress that i believe is going on and will continue to go on in the covent garden area <e> <s> i do not think this is a positive amendment and i ask the committee to reject it <e>", "<cs> may i say that having served as a member of the historic buildings committee i should like to put on record the high <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that comment <e> <s> i am delighted to hear that some action will be taken <e> <s> i should like to ask him whether he agrees that this is at the moment a great disincentive to an owner-occupier who lets his property and that because of that it is keeping off the market properties that would otherwise be available at a time when there is a great need for further accommodation for rent <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm the information that i have been given that it is not even necessary to relet but that even to extend the original letting to the orginal tenant could still disqualify the owner from obtaining possession <e>", "<cs> my lords can i ask the minister just one further question <e> <s> does he realise that many people may already inadvertently be finding themselves in the position where this has happened to them <e> <s> will the government take that into consideration <e>", "<cs> because we seem to have gone backwards and forwards so often from amendment no <e> <s> the amendment of the noble baroness lady birk to amendment no <e> <s> i think a degree of confusion is arising in the committee <e> <s> i should like very firmly to oppose amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should like also to draw attention to the fact that the movers of amendment no <e> <s> or those who have spoken to amendment no <e> <s> have made very effective points against amendment no <e> <s> in particular their statement that a function requiring a long-term and assured future should not be handed over to a body that has only a life of five years <e> <s> therefore i think that anyone who is seriously interested in the long-term future of waste disposal must be very clear on that point that it is no good handing it over to a body whose life is limited to five years <e>", "<cs> i know that technically we are dealing with amendment no <e> <s> a but we have been discussing many other points at the same time <e> <s> i think that it is very important that the archives should be kept in a comprehensive whole somewhere but i do not see any reason why that has to be in the residuary body and i hope that the minister can advise us of another solution <e>", "<cs> yes i will give way <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that point <e> <s> i certainly am fascinated <e> <s> for example when the records office was moved many of us were never informed why or where it was going though i suppose it is possible that that happened during the brief period while i was not a member <e> <s> it was really that obscure it simply vanished <e> <s> however i think there is no encouragement to members of the public to go to see the archives <e> <s> there is encouragement to historians yes that point has been made <e> <s> there is encouragement to serious students if they make an application but there has never been to my knowledge any encouragement to the general public to go <e>", "<cs> while i have considerable sympathy with many of the comments of the noble lord lord stallard i cannot at all see that these amendments do the job that he suggests <e> <s> i strongly support concessionary fares and anyone who has worked in social services is well aware of their great social benefit and of the benefit to the health of those who are able to have them <e>", "<cs> i wish to oppose the amendment <e> <s> as i know everyone is waiting for dinner i shall do so very briefly <e>", "<cs> it is my understanding that this house is not open in the ordinary sense as a museum unless conditions have changed since it was first converted into a historic monument or historic museum for the public <e> <s> you had to telephone and arrange to go and see it you could not just arrive there <e> <s> has that changed <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord can tell me <e> <s> it was also my understanding that because of the intact nature of the property and the very original furniture and furnishings within it extreme care had to be taken about allowing in light and special precautions had to be taken to avoid pilfering as already mentioned <e> <s> however the very fact that the victorian society presently holds a lease on the property would mean that it would continue to do so when the property transfers to the borough <e> <s> i would think that that would be the appropriate thing to happen <e>", "<cs> i find this a most interesting amendment in that i have often been to the foyer and taken overseas visitors there <e> <s> it is certainly very attractive and i think it a great tourist asset <e> <s> however i do not really think it is right to write it into the bill because as i understand it if this were part of the bill it would perpetuate the situation for ever more <e> <s> while the foyer is very attractive and i hope it will continue and we shall not see any change there i think that to write it into the bill might mean that it would go on for ever whether it were successful or not <e> <s> that seems rather restrictive <e> <s> so i hope there will be some way whereby the noble lord the minister can indicate he thinks there might be some hope of it continuing without actually writing it into the bill in these very words <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this bill <e> <s> i have listened with great interest to the contributions of other members as i remember so clearly the last second reading although i was not in the house or involved the first time that this bill came before us <e> <s> the fact that it has had to come a third time indicates how important it is and how impossible it was to reach a satisfactory solution before <e> <s> as it stands now many of the problems which came up last time have been solved in the bill as it is before us <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that no matter how well thought-out plans are changes in population and age groups do necessitate a review and a rethink of these issues <e>", "<cs> under those circumstances if it is to be a precepting authority then it will set a precept on the poorest of the poor in the same way as it will on everyone else <e> <s> will there then be an exemption or some way in which to help those people <e> <s> it seems to me that if we are to set up yet another precepting authority we shall run into all the same problems as we have at present <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply to the points made by the noble lord lord pitt about the so-called rich boroughs and what they do or do not <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up the last point made by the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend lady carnegy has brought forward this amendment as a reaction to what she considers to be the extreme proposal for a per cent <e> <s> majority <e> <s> i oppose the figure of per cent <e> <s> but i think that my noble friends figure of per cent <e> <s> is probably an automatic reaction <e> <s> i think that the government are for once probably right with a figure of two-thirds <e>", "<cs> on that point perhaps i may ask my noble friend to clarify it again <e> <s> i understood him to say per cent <e> <s> of those voting <e> <s> i think that that is emphasising the very point i made earlier <e> <s> there is quite a significant difference whether it is of those present and voting or whether it is of the boroughs <e> <s> could he confirm that he said of those voting <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies on this point i should like to draw to his attention that the conservative group on the womens committee at county hall has consistently opposed and voted against all those particular child care facilities that the noble baroness has just referred to <e> <s> it has been a strongly political issue <e> <s> the reason is that the conservative group believes that these matters should come under the local borough <e> <s> it is the local borough social services department which rightfully funds child-care facilities not the greater london council <e> <s> therefore i consider that after abolition when the additional funds are left with the local boroughs if it is true that boroughs such as lambeth islington and southwark have applied for such vast quantities for child care facilities they will be keen and will surely carry them on afterwards particularly <e>", "<cs> i mentioned earlier in the debate that there was this agreement which was strongly opposed by the conservative party between the labour boroughs and the glc whereby the statement was made if you wish to avoid rate capping push it all up here to county hall and we will fund it and you will not rise above the rate-capped level <e> <s> this has always been a deliberate and clearly agreed policy between the labour boroughs i may add <e> <s> whenever i spoke about that myself in the womens committee i was told that i should see that the conservative boroughs applied for something <e> <s> i regularly did and they never had the same success in getting anything <e>", "<cs> is it not a fact that the urban aid programme has always helped the ethnic minorities quite a lot <e> <s> perhaps the minister could tell us whether with these additional moneys to be given some similar system might operate so that again there might be a possibility for funding <e> <s> it is a great encouragement to boroughs to put in funds if they feel they are going to get quite a slice of government funds to assist them <e> <s> that has been the case with the ethnic minorities in urban aid programmes in the past <e>", "<cs> anyone who remembers the transfer of housing authority staff from the greater london council to the local boroughs comparatively recently will recall the great embarrassment and difficulties caused by the upgrading of salaries just before the move and the local boroughs then receiving the new staff found the position quite impossible <e> <s> that has shown in practice how important this clause is <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister a brief question or at least ask her to pass this point on for consideration <e> <s> i certainly welcome the suggestion that everyone should be aware of what rates are and what services cost <e> <s> i think it remains to be seen whether this is worked out in a humane way <e> <s> however may i ask her to ensure that when the new system of rate rebate comes into operation there will be no limitation in regard to the rateable value of property in view of the fact that some people have suffered great hardship perhaps towards the fag-end of a lease in respect of what is a highly-rated property <e> <s> can that point be passed on to her colleagues <e>", "<cs> i have not spoken against these amendments though i oppose them because i feel we have said so much at the previous stage of the bill and on earlier occasions <e> <s> it seems to me judging from the last few remarks that we are getting slightly confused <e> <s> i understood that the noble baroness lady jeger was asking whether when circumcision is illegal there will be any way of notifying what legal operations of a similar nature had been carried out for medical purposes <e> <s> i thought that was the question the noble baroness lady jeger was asking <e> <s> obviously if the bill goes through no one will be notifying anything done illegally <e> <s> that would be more than we could ever expect <e> <s> it is an interesting point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course opposed to the amendment as it is quite unnecessary <e> <s> it would make the whole position horribly expensive <e> <s> every patient who imagines he has anything wrong will be ready to believe that fluoride in the water is the cause of it <e> <s> all such people will automatically demand an alternative supply <e> <s> the noble earl lord kinnoull said that one can purchase a small apparatus which can be fitted inexpensively <e> <s> i think it only right that people who do not want <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i draw to his attention the fact that i did not say you must move <e> <s> i said your may move or you could move <e> <s> i was not suggesting any compulsion <e> <s> i was saying that in this country people still have that free choice <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords although the debate seems to have ranged over amendment no <e> <s> which i welcome we are actually debating amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble lord lord ennals as an amendment to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> his speech was very lengthy and ranged over all sorts of arguments about beer and tea without going on to make the point that however much beer or tea one drinks the concentration of one part per million means that one would need to have an almost inhuman impossible capacity for drinks to be able to reach a danger level <e> <s> that point was not mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that flexibility of hours could help some people who wish to find employment in that it might provide additional jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that today we have become very confused with these amendments <e> <s> the noble baroness lady stedman moved her amendment no <e> <s> and then the noble lord lord kilmarnock hopped up and spoke to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is totally related to the metropolitan counties and amendment no <e> <s> is totally related to london <e> <s> jumbling the two amendments together in this way has made it quite confusing for members to follow the arguments <e> <s> when i listened to the noble baroness she spoke about waste disposal authorities taking over mineral rights and reclamation of land i thought that that was very interesting and might be relevant to the metropolitan counties but it certainly did not seem at all appropriate to london as i knew it <e> <s> then when the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to oppose this amendment <e> <s> when i heard the noble lord lord fanshawe say that it was not really asking very much it was only asking for an inquiry i felt i must say that that is not strictly correct <e> <s> it is asking for deletion from this bill of the power of the secretary of state to create a trunk road out of what is now a metropolitan road <e> <s> so it is a bit more than as outlined by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i heard the speech of the noble lord tonight <e> <s> i heard it on the previous occasion <e> <s> i am well aware of the south circular road <e> <s> my own constituency is on the north circular road which is trunked and which i thought was a good thing <e> <s> it has been greatly improved ever since <e> <s> if the south circular had been trunked years ago we might be better off today <e> <s> i have every sympathy with people who have problems <e> <s> to speak particularly about those roads in the case of the north circular plans have been brought forward for the improvement of every intersection <e> <s> great things can be done in terms of flyovers underpasses and so on <e> <s> there are many ways in which roads can be improved to the benefit of the local people not to their detriment <e> <s> but the noble lord lord ardwick is wrong in thinking that my example of the fire station is irrelevant <e> <s> i could also mention and i am sure the noble baroness lady faithful would agree that everyone wants a proposed home for mentally handicapped children but not where he or she lives <e> <s> they all want it in the next street <e> <s> whatever is suggested as an improvement for everyone else people are delighted to have but not if it affects their own front doorstep <e> <s> that is exactly the case with the special pleading about the south circular road <e> <s> a number of people have written to me about how concerned and worried they are about the trunking of the south circular <e> <s> i have written back to say that they are <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that the building of new hospitals now in london at st marys paddington and the new national heart hospital will improve the situation referred to by the noble lord lord ennals where the types of beds available were not necessarily the types needed and that where new hospitals are built that situation will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to oppose the amendment <e> <s> i must apologise to the house for the fact that i had not realised that we had recommenced discussion on the bill or i would have been here to listen to the noble lord who moved the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i should have said the noble baroness <e> <s> i looked at the monitor which indicated that the noble lord lord kilmarnock was speaking <e> <s> obviously i was sitting in the wrong position in the dining room to see when this matter started <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down would he not agree that the consultations are an essential and that at present for example some of the church schools feel very much discriminated against by the ilea <e> <s> indeed many of us cannot agree with the remarks of the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> i sat on a church school committee this week and heard of the terrible discrimination as regards supply teachers for that school <e> <s> certainly the local borough would want to give much greater support to the independent and church schools <e>", "<cs> my lords am i entitled to speak on amendment no <e> <s> a just to say that with my origins i am not at all happy about the word transportation <e> <s> i hope that the government will think of something else <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships know i have spoken on the issue of concessionary fares before because i believe they are of great social and even of health benefit to people to have a degree of mobility <e> <s> it probably enables us to save considerable public money in other ways such as in the provision of home helps and other care <e> <s> but i am not sure that these amendments are the right way to achieve this <e> <s> i hope they will not be pressed tonight <e>", "<cs> because my lords if they are pressed tonight i believe they will be lost <e> <s> i could not support them in their present form <e> <s> i hope that the minister will take this matter away think about it and bring forward something for london on the lines of a reserve scheme to which the noble baroness lady fisher referred <e> <s> i hope that the district councils will bring in a scheme of their own <e> <s> in the london provision it was as she said a reserve power which would come into force if the boroughs in the case of london did not bring in a scheme of their own <e>", "<cs> my lords to continue on that very point i intended to go into the million <e> <s> it must be appreciated that that million which at the moment is in the hands of the west midlands county council is million more that is still back in the pockets of the district ratepayers <e> <s> so that money will not mysteriously vanish <e> <s> it will be available it is a matter whether the districts will apply it to the concessionary fares scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation remains the same <e> <s> i should like to hear from the noble baroness whether they have photos on the passes now in her area <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i think you have eliminated the major problem which was that of people using passes at the expense of other ratepayers when they did not belong at all <e> <s> i believe that with these photos we can have good schemes <e> <s> you can ensure that the people who are entitled to use the concession actually are those who are doing so <e> <s> i should like to see the government look at this and come up with a scheme but i do not support these amendments as they stand tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that this situation has arisen over many years and to some extent in the case of london because of the policy of moving people out of london does my noble friend the minister not agree that there is a great reversal of previous policies and that this will take considerable time to effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to oppose this amendment <e> <s> the implication that the greater london council owns the green belt is quite inaccurate <e> <s> much of the green belt is in private ownership and yet from the speech of the noble lord lord kilmarnock there came the implication that the glc was the owner as well as the protector of the green belt <e> <s> the noble lord lord birkett spoke about the farm in denham <e> <s> to my knowledge denham is in buckinghamshire and i think the buckinghamshire county council would be quite capable of protecting land there <e> <s> most of these farms a number are in my own glc constituency are tenanted and the tenants have every right that farming tenants have everywhere else <e> <s> therefore i see no sudden dramatic change about to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house would the noble lord tell us whether he is winding up to finish this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first saw amendment no <e> <s> b i was immediately attracted to it and thought it made sense but the more i have gone into it the more i find that it is not very practical <e> <s> at the moment clause is permissive <e> <s> under this amendment it would become compulsive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am just quoting what was said to me last night in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords exactly so and that is exactly what was said to me not by the noble baroness but by the other representatives who were there <e> <s> they said that a great many of these new-style labour district councils believe that there is no place whatsoever for voluntary organisations and that it should be done totally by the local boroughs themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is an understandable point of view <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham asks what are the conservative views <e> <s> certainly i will tell your lordships what my views were when i was a chairman of social services <e> <s> my views were that you supported those voluntary organisations which were doing a good job which were cost-effective and which were doing something better more cheaply or with a wider involvement than you could do it yourself in your local authority social services through your own department <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to finish my speech he will perhaps follow the point i am about to make <e> <s> the point i am about to make is that every area that we are talking about which is an area of concern is outside london <e> <s> i am told that we are not concerned about london because in london there is a fair balance of authorities of all parties <e> <s> i am told the concern is it the metropolitan authorities about which i know little but i believe that each metropolitan authority that is being abolished is labour controlled <e> <s> if it is labour controlled it certainly means that there is a majority of labour authorities there <e> <s> i am really paying a compliment to the labour party when i say that i believe they would not allow voluntary organisations to vanish <e> <s> why therefore is there such grave doubt about these labour controlled areas <e> <s> why are they the areas that it is suggested that an amendment like this should protect and cover <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like someone to clarify that point <e> <s> i understood that to decide to set up a scheme at all required just a simple majority of the boroughs <e> <s> to decide then to give a grant required per cent <e> <s> these are the two essential points and those who are saying to me that it is rot by a simple majority have not i believe studied the bill carefully <e> <s> i think it is a simple majority <e> <s> is that point agreed or would the noble lord who is shaking his head like to come back on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the decision whether or not to give money to a particular scheme <e> <s> that is not the decision whether to have a body that will consider whether or not grants should be given <e> <s> is the house clear on this point <e> <s> i think it is most essential that we should be <e>", "<cs> my lords returning to the original argument it was said for example that all this vast giving over the whole of london is so desirable and so impressive but it should be appreciated that many london boroughs give directly themselves and they like to give directly for that part of a particular voluntary organisation which operates within their borough <e> <s> the citizens advice bureau was quoted <e> <s> i know very well that local boroughs give <e>", "<cs> my lords i would <e>", "<cs> my lords i would of course be guided by whatever decision the house reached on this <e> <s> however i have heard the noble baroness speak many times on housing <e> <s> i consider that as i am a district chairman of housing on the greater london council it would be to the benefit of the house to hear my views in addition to those of the noble baroness lady denington who certainly has had great housing experience on the glc <e> <s> i would ask the house whether or not it wishes me to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the house for its support <e> <s> i intend to speak only briefly <e> <s> in particular i should like to draw attention to one or two points made by the noble baroness lady denington whose speech i heard <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that comment <e> <s> one of the supposedly greatly advantageous things about the present way of getting work done is that the present greater london council employs a direct labour force called london community builders who are both very expensive and i believe not very effective <e> <s> all over london now as has been said these dwellings that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister before he sits down to clarify for me the position as regards those people who would be irreplaceable <e> <s> throughout the debate that we have had on the glc we have been told that there are certain qualifications held by people that are unique and that these very people will be wanted wherever they will later find their place <e> <s> i just wonder whether this amendment is so general that when we are so busily encouraging everyone to retire early we might lose those people <e> <s> i think it is important that the scheme should be developed in such a way that the services of those people whom one really wanted to continue until they had finished their normal working period would be covered <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that information on this matter is of great importance to the tenants concerned and that many electricity authorities and certainly the london electricity board issue leaflets explaining to tenants the maximum amount that should be chargeable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unhappy about the statement which has just been made <e> <s> i understand that i have the right under standing orders to move this amendment <e> <s> if the noble lord would clarify his reasons in greater detail to the satisfaction of the house then i might not move this amendment <e> <s> i was present in the chamber the other night at ten past eleven when this point was made would it be possible for the noble lord lord rochester to cover this amendment in the remaining minutes for which it was agreed the business would be extended <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister a couple of questions on this <e>", "<cs> my lords i would wish to oppose this amendment because i believe the bill as it stands is necessary to protect those officers who are willing to allow access to documents but may well be instructed not to co-operate and not to allow access <e> <s> i think in this way the bill is helping those people <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> if he thinks that local authorities have not been extravagant and that they are so heavily rate capped how does he account for the current statement being made at county hall about the vast surpluses that the glc has this year which it is quite unable to spend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to say that although i support the existing amendment i should have been very unhappy had my noble friend moved any further amendment on the subject <e> <s> i think that the consultation is absolutely necessary particularly in view of the vast amount paid by the cities of westminster and london for the education of the whole of london <e> <s> consultation is essential <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord moved the amendment after that one <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike my noble friend i do not use the word premature i think it was long overdue that the labour party tabled an amendment concerning the staff which really cared about staff interests <e> <s> it is very sad that this amendment has been tabled at this stage when it is far too late and far too ill-thought-out for anyone here to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house may i say that on th june i personally asked the other side to speak on that amendment which the noble lord lord rochester was not willing to move and they declined to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gifford is quite correct in that the recent glc funding has been through section but my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter was correct that at an earlier stage section was used in a similar way <e> <s> one of the reasons for the change was the councils advice from the noble lord who declared the interest <e>", "<cs> true <e> <s> however my lords one thing i learned at county hall was that if you want to spend money for political purposes there are many different sections under which you can do it <e> <s> we also seem to be using the national health act quite a lot to give grants to various projects and so there is a wide choice of items <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly oppose this amendment because although it looks so harmless it is an incredibly vicious little amendment <e> <s> it would mean that in two years time all those authorities which presently have fluoridated water would find themselves in that same illegal position as they are in today <e> <s> we are passing this bill simply to legalise fluoridation of the water where it already exists <e>", "<cs> my lords as the second dentist in this chamber i must of course say how delighted i am that this bill has reached this point <e> <s> i take issue with the comments of the noble lord lord ennals as to why the government did not go ahead and compel everyone to have fluoride everywhere <e> <s> i think in fact it is evidence of the genuineness of this bill that it is simply to put into a correct legal position those authorities which have fluoride in their water and are presently not in such a position <e> <s> when the noble lord says that it should have been a compulsion and indeed he went on to say he wanted it resolved when he was secretary of state i cannot see if he wanted it so much why it did not happen then because i believe that every standing dental and medical advisory committee since the war has voted in favour of this measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> i should emphasise and ask him whether he agrees the importance of having as soon as possible a report which will do something to eliminate the constant digging up and reinstatement of streets and the great inconvenience caused to people <e> <s> this is in addition to the very excessive expense due to the repetitive digging of holes in the streets <e> <s> will he accept from me that there are holes a year dug in the roads of westminster alone <e> <s> indeed three of them are immediately outside your lordships house for the third time <e> <s> the gas board started again last night <e> <s> although the procedure requires days notice to be given to the council <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is can my noble friend believe that as the water board claims per cent <e> <s> of these holes are emergencies and only per cent <e> <s> are planned work <e>", "<cs> my lords as no one else seems to want to ask a question on this matter perhaps i may ask the minister this <e> <s> is he also aware that delays in reinstatement involve traffic delays and also damage to vehicles passing over unrestored roads <e> <s> does he agree that any collaboration to speed up these processes must be desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that in this area there are two major hospitals guys and kings and that therefore the provision has been rather in excess of any other part of london or possibly the whole country and that the local health authorities must be the people able to decide <e> <s> can my noble friend explain also to whom the noble lord lord ennals was referring when he referred to the chairman of the board of governors <e> <s> as i understand it guys does not have a retained board of governors <e> <s> was he referring to the teaching hospital or the hospital itself because surely that comes under the district <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that in the greater london area many employers are seeking staff and are unable to obtain them <e> <s> this is due very often to people not having the necessary skills <e> <s> is not the question more one of introducing the appropriate training <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the bill and to oppose the amendment <e> <s> this is not the first time that i have spoken on this matter of shop opening as we had a great deal of debate in this house in <e> <s> i remember speaking at that time and in particular mentioning queensway which is london w <e> <s> just north of the park <e> <s> most people in this chamber will know it well <e>

then woolworths the only other large store in that street have also applied for permission to open on sundays have been refused and have gone the same way <e> <s> that end of the street is now totally dead and has been so for the last two or more years <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the article in the journal of the institution of <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the expression charity

to reclassify the charities because while there are some we would all wish to see supported there are others such as educational institutions which i do not know have the same claim to our general sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that westminster council is actually opposed to these present markings which have been placed on the road <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to welcome this bill and particularly to follow the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce who is so highly regarded in australia <e> <s> any member of the australian bar coming to this country is thrilled if he or she has the opportunity to meet this member of our house <e> <s> it is claimed that the noble and learned lord has done more for law in australia than anyone in australia <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl the minister aware of how uncompetitive our airports shops are in comparison with those in most other countries <e>", "<cs> i do not support these amendments in their present form but i think the noble lord lord graham has made one very important point <e> <s> that is i think there are a lot of people who are not quite sure whether they do or do not want to work on a sunday <e> <s> people who some months ago spoke to me about their never wanting to work on a sunday are now saying to me that they think they might <e> <s> but they appreciate exactly the point the noble lord has made that if they accept that opportunity to work on a sunday to give it a try then they have lost their right ever to say that they do not want to do so <e> <s> i think there is a case for some sort of a trial period by mutual agreement perhaps between employer and employee which would still give them a later right <e> <s> it seems to me that we may be losing a lot of people who if they only had the opportunity to work on a sunday might find it suited them very well <e>", "<cs> i would thank my noble friend for that and state that i was not here <e> <s> i have only just flown back into london <e> <s> i have come in because i have an amendment down in my name <e> <s> but i will read in <e>", "<cs> what worries me very much about this amendment is its absolutely unlimited nature <e> <s> as i read it a shopworker could keep giving one months notice <e> <s> the shopworker could regularly keep saying to the employer yes i will work on sundays and do a few sundays then give another months notice and be off again <e> <s> there is no suggestion in the amendment that it should be a once-only notice <e>", "<cs> the point must be made here that in most of the cases i see people are not applying for reinstatement <e> <s> compensation is what most people are asking for <e> <s> however an industrial tribunal does have the right to order reinstatement <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> there are still a few points in it which do not satisfy me <e> <s> although people over retirement age as he mentioned can bring a case as i understand it no compensation is payable to anyone over retirement age compensation is reduced by so much per year for every year when one approaches retirement age <e> <s> i understand that no compensation was payable for unfair dismissal over retirement age <e> <s> however if i am wrong i should like to be corrected on that <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister <e> <s> i can check from my own books on the matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords like many other speakers tonight i regret that i shall not be able to stay because i am committed to duties for the inter-parliamentary union <e> <s> i try never to leave a debate in advance but i feel that when one is meeting a delegation from another parliament abroad one must honour that commitment <e> <s> i was rather amused by the noble lord lord stallard saying that this is all rush and hassle because he certainly did his best to slow things down a bit with minutes on the monitor by the time he sat down <e> <s> i am hoping that i shall be able to be a little more brief <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord what is the position concerning oil for fuel for heating in the home <e> <s> at the moment that is very much more expensive as a means of heating than gas or coal yet time was when it was much cheaper <e> <s> when can those people who are now finding they have an installation which is very costly to run expect to see some improvement in their oil prices <e> <s> can the government do anything to encourage the companies to bring down prices to the consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that westminster council has expressed firm opposition to the bus lane outside this house <e> <s> does he therefore believe that we can hope for an early reversal of the system <e>", "<cs> my lords last july we had in nairobi a world conference to mark the end of the decade of women <e> <s> out of that conference came a document of over paragraphs of forward-looking strategies to the year <e> <s> within those strategies there is every call for equality of treatment in terms of taxation and a number of conferences and meetings have been held in this country and attended by a large number of womens organisations and individuals <e> <s> one that met in december sent me just this week the recommendations that they had put forward on improvements that should be made in taxation so far as women are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that bodies such as the london electricity board are doing a great deal to help domestic consumers make personal savings by better information campaigns and are thus enabling them to obtain better value for money in the use of energy as well as to save energy <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend inform me about whether this is a parallel situation to that of rhodesia house which remained empty for a number of years because relations ceased with that country <e> <s> in that instance a rate bill of approximately million mounted for westminister <e> <s> or was that a different situation because it concerned a commonwealth country and a foreign nation creates different problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord marshall for <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see that the noble lord is going to protest about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that comment <e> <s> however i do not agree with it because whenever one talks about what is being held or withheld one ignores any penalties or a ratecapping situation that exists <e> <s> one has only to listen to the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> the noble lord has told us that glasgow with i believe an equally bad situation is doing something about that <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that probably the most common form of diagnostic radiography is dental x-rays i wonder whether my noble friend the minister can comment on any protection advised for dentists or patients <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that people come to a surgery and check for any excess radiation which is escaping from machines and that this has been extremely valuable certainly in the dental profession <e> <s> is she aware of a similar situation with medical x-ray equipment and is that also checked <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment of my noble friend lady platt <e> <s> it is sensible that in the first subsection of the amendment she has included the words <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that most of the women who need this service more than others are those who are most reluctant to go for screening <e> <s> is he also aware that very effective mobile clinics visit sites where a large number of women work and that it would be a simple exercise to have such a mobile clinic for a brief time <e> <s> that would give an opportunity to people here and thus capture treat or at least screen a number of women who would not go to their general practitioners or take the trouble to go elsewhere for these essential tests <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for bringing this subject to the house for debate today and it is a most interesting subject <e> <s> i note the first part of the motion concerning the increase in crime but i intend to speak about measures to protect innocent people <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i think the difficulty with all statistice is that we cannot assess what is not there <e> <s> the point has been made by other speakers that the degree of frustration felt by young people can be quite a worrying aspect of this problem <e> <s> in london however <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> perhaps i may point out to the noble lord that those sitting in the second row of seats find that their voices are heard only with great difficulty in other parts of the committee <e> <s> on this side of the committee we often have considerable difficulty hearing the noble lord <e> <s> i know from experience that one has to be in row one or row three in order to be <e>", "<cs> having listened to all the comments on denis rooke it appears that some people in this chamber seem to think there is no other man in the whole of the united kingdom equal to him <e> <s> after all why a man <e> <s> why not a woman <e> <s> i have the highest regard for denis rooke as i think we all have but to listen to this debate it sounds as if he were a most terrifying and impossible giant to deal with <e> <s> that is throwing quite a false image before the house <e> <s> there will be plenty of people capable of taking this job <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i appreciate the points that he is making <e> <s> i consider that the points which he made very clearly and at some length earlier were relevant to amendment no <e> <s> but they are not relevant to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as i read amendment no <e> <s> i do not consider that it suggests a panel of people <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is really covering the special qualifications of one particular person <e> <s> therefore i think his comments at this moment are not precisely relevant to this particular point <e>", "<cs> i am slightly puzzled by this amendment <e> <s> is this yet another proposal to have three people instead of one <e> <s> is it really a similar type of amendment returning through the back door <e> <s> i support very strongly the view put forward by my noble friend who said that this amendment would definitely discriminate against england because at the moment there are many regions in england and scotland is just one region <e> <s> to compare this with electricity board structures or with electricity supply structures would be quite wrong because the way in which the electricity industry is operated throughout the united kingdom is quite different from the means used for the gas system <e> <s> i cannot support this amendment as it stands and i ask the committee to reject it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that a similar position exists with regard to the fares to heathrow <e> <s> those fares are also specially geared at a price quite different from normal <e> <s> the fare as far as hatton cross is lower and is designed to be used by residents of london but the minute you go past hatton cross as far as heathrow the fare is specially geared to be an airport fare for overseas visitors <e> <s> could it not be said that that is a principle similar to that in respect of gatwick and that there is a special fare attached to airport travel at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister not agree that most members of the public would prefer the government not to interfere in any way if it means an increase in the fare to heathrow rather than the fare to gatwick decreasing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for giving us the opporunity to debate this subject which i find a very interesting one <e> <s> i begin by saving that knowing of his great knowledge of the health service i was somewhat surprised to hear how amazed he was at the private hospital with beds at a night <e> <s> many of the costs of national health service hospitals are now enormously high although perhaps the patients do not realise it but i had thought that the noble lord would be aware of it <e> <s> i left the chamber briefly to telephone to check on that matter <e> <s> in the cost of keeping a patient at the national heart hospital was per night excluding any capital cost <e> <s> such things have become expensive <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> that leads on to the rest of the argument that i was going to bring against him <e> <s> i blame the labour party for this division of the health service and particularly of hospital treatment into separate private and national health service camps <e> <s> when we had pay beds nhs patients definitely benefited from the amount of time the consultants were able to spend at the hospital which now they spend travelling between their private and their nhs commitments <e> <s> that separation has not been a good thing in terms of medical treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that the government announced additional funds for the united nations development fund for women just this february <e> <s> will she also confirm that the prime minister is herself the honorary president of the british committee set up to raise funds for development for women <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that it is not the length of the queue but the length of the time in the queue that is important and that in some post offices where a single queueing system has been introduced the queue itself might be quite lengthy but the service really quite quick <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that explanation and of course i accept it <e> <s> had he approached me and suggested adding his name i would have done my best to discourage him because there are so many amendments to this bill under his name that i think it is a disincentive to have the amendment accepted <e> <s> unfortunately throughout the course of this bill the noble lord has rather tried our patience in terms of time <e> <s> therefore i do not think his name being added to it particularly helps <e> <s> i am hoping that his good motives and the support of other members of the committee and the fact that the amendment is good will be sufficient in itself to persuade the minister to accept it <e> <s> i certainly accept that lord whaddon would never intend any discourtesy either but this is a point i felt i should like to make <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting reply from my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i cannot quite decide whether i am satisfied with it because when he started off by saying that it was a case not of whether to have it but of how to have it i was very pleased <e> <s> i thought it was only a matter of looking at a few minor words and sorting our something between us <e> <s> but then when he went on to say that there was no need for the present national gas consumers council to consult widely i wondered how widely that was and how long it meant <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to be here even at such a late hour to support my noble friend the minister in the second reading of this bill <e> <s> her opening speech was so clear and it explained in detail a bill that is extremely complicated <e> <s> but the speech that i have enjoyed most tonight has been that of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> he said almost everything that i wish i could have said <e> <s> that is quite a contrast to the occasion when we met in the same way over fluoridation when i could have wished him much further away <e>", "<cs> that my lords is the way it has been quoted <e>", "<cs> my lords i might add that it has also been quoted that he said in india <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that clarification <e> <s> but i should like also to ask whether or not the leader of the opposition said that the british nationality act was a racialist measure <e>", "<cs> my lords he did say it was a racialist measure <e> <s> i am as affected by the british nationality act as any other immigrant of any colour <e> <s> i do not accept that it is a racialist act <e> <s> i do not look racially any different from any other european but all my family are prevented from coming here in the same way <e>", "<cs> funnily enough i do not intend to approach this at all in the way the noble lord lord graham seems to expect <e> <s> i happen to be on the london electricity board and the major worry for them is bad debts and the major reason for that is people who move from address to address without notifying a change <e> <s> it is not a case of poor unfortunate people in the majority of cases <e> <s> this represents many millions of pounds every year just in the london area <e> <s> it represents a sum of such size that it has an effect on every other consumer in the london area <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may come back on this point to say that i consider that my amendment which comes up later is a better way of dealing with this and of helping those who really need to make only a small deposit people who are genuine cases <e> <s> i shall be discussing this when we reach my <e>", "<cs> in replying first to the point raised about the words or otherwise i would say that there is no provision so far as i know for taking premium bonds or savings certificates <e> <s> i see no reason why that sort of thing should not be acceptable but it may be rather a nuisance to the authority holding them <e> <s> the words or otherwise really mean i believe an assurance given by a third party willing to guarantee that your bill will be paid <e> <s> i was asked to do this for one of my children <e> <s> if she could produce a bill paid by her mother she could have a gas supply on my guarantee that i would pay her bill if she did not <e> <s> that is one form of interpreting or otherwise <e>", "<cs> the question has been raised as to how many of these cases there would be likely to be <e> <s> i can tell the committee that in the north thames gas consumer area which has just under million consumers and covers an area of over square miles complain s were handled in but of those complaints only were arbitration cases and that number was i understand by far the greatest number anywhere in the country <e> <s> therefore we are not talking about a very major item <e> <s> anything that touches our pockets is always a sensitive matter <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way i think that is not correct <e> <s> the six-monthly term is possibly used in the bill because it is usually held for one year which would be a period of two six months <e> <s> so that might be why it has been phrased in this way <e> <s> but it is not held as a permanent security and it would be very wrong if it were <e>", "<cs> as i understand it until a period of one year has elapsed in which you have been paying separately and independently for either your telephone or your electricity you are paying in addition <e> <s> but after one year that amount can be applied to the next bill plus any amount of interest that you would be due <e>", "<cs> i think there is a case for having consultation with the consumer council but i must point out to the committee that it can be a rather hollow exercise <e> <s> this process goes on now between the various energy authorities and their consumer councils <e> <s> every consumer council automatically believes that there should be no increase in anything <e> <s> when that sort of attitude is taken the exercise is pointless <e> <s> other consumer councils and consultative bodies decide that they should be the people setting the charges and more or less try to dictate to the energy authority and that is equally useless <e>", "<cs> i should like the minister to explain how the amendment if passed would affect people in areas where at present there is no gas <e> <s> i know many people in country areas who would like to have a gas supply but who have no hope whatever of getting that supply <e> <s> their only hope might be through agreeing to a more expensive supply so making it worthwhile for someone to run a gas pipe to those areas <e> <s> i am wondering whether the amendment if passed would prevent such an action <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord bruce of donington did not understand my point <e> <s> i felt that if a supplier was able to supply only at the present rate there might be people who would like gas would be willing to pay a little more to have gas and yet have no hope of ever getting it <e>", "<cs> i should like to make the briefest of comments <e> <s> i believe there is an additional charge but the figure of a week is more than i would have estimated it to be <e> <s> obviously the charge is more simply because the costs are more not that anyone wishes it to be more <e> <s> however if one is to have additional requirements as suggested in the amendment that will push up the costs more and prices will have to increase to meet those costs <e> <s> the amendment could therefore be not beneficial <e>", "<cs> i rise just to say that i think the noble earl the deputy chairman of committeds is right and that the next amendment to be considered is amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i was waiting for someone to say not moved so that i could then rise and say in respect of amendment no <e> <s> not moved <e>", "<cs> i do not think that this is getting the picture the right way round <e> <s> the bill provides that the gas supplier should keep the meter in order <e> <s> i am sure that if your meter was not in order and you could prove that you would not have to pay <e>", "<cs> the problem is that the energy authorities do not like to have more than one estimated account but access is often a major difficulty <e> <s> sometimes they can attend or times <e> <s> they will arrange special appointments and do almost anything to read the meter but access can be prevented and that is frequently because someone has a high reading for which they do not want to be billed <e> <s> however if someone is given a high bill they will rapidly send in one of the cards and point out that they owe much less <e> <s> i do not think that that is a problem <e>", "<cs> it should be said i believe that we impose on our energy authorities in this country a great burden of social problems that should really be the responsibility of the social services <e> <s> it is quite an education to go to france and to see there that no thought whatever is given to people who have not paid anything <e> <s> they are cut off in one moment <e> <s> i would never advocate such action here <e> <s> our present procedures are very adequate and very caring and require no amendment <e> <s> the court procedures are good and the additional one that has been suggested is too much <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take this opportunity to ask the noble baroness about the situation in the new hospitals that have been referred to and in particular in the new brompton national heart hospital which is under construction <e> <s> i attended a meeting this week to see the plans <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord hunter of newington for bringing this very interesting debate before the house today <e> <s> it concerns a subject in which i have a great interest <e> <s> as a general dental practitioner i have always felt an affinity with the pharmacists with whom i have served on many health committees <e> <s> indeed most of my remarks will be about the community pharmacist <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank noble lords who have taken part in this second reading debate and who have made their points so clearly and succinctly <e> <s> it is clear that we shall have quite a lot to discuss at the committee stage in terms of compensation <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that it is very important for us to have a continuing lively tourist industry <e> <s> whatever we do we must take great care not to cause any cut-backs to an extent that would damage the revenue brought in from the tourist industry <e>", "<cs> <e> <s> i think that the wording in the present schedule is perfectly appropriate and leaves a degree of flexibility <e> <s> surely by inserting the word shall we are just pinning the government down to making a detailed list which may not be appropriate and which may not leave the same degree of flexibility <e> <s> i do not support the amendment <e>", "<cs> while i am not able to support this amendment because i do not know the exact financial or actuarial implications of the change of date i should like to take this opportunity to say how pleased i am to welcome the pension provision regarding widowers <e> <s> i have myself for many years as a national health practitioner paid an equal pension and thought it wrong that if my husband died i would get a pension but that if i died he would get nothing <e> <s> that seemed wrong <e> <s> so many women i know who have worked for pensions for years have really felt this <e> <s> very often in this chamber i am busy fighting for womens rights but in this instance i welcome an improvement in the situation of the men who can find themselves left in a very difficult position if perhaps they have small children <e> <s> i think it can be even more difficult for a man to be left to bring up a family on his own <e> <s> so i am delighted to see this provision in the bill and i believe that it is something we have long wanted <e>", "<cs> some mention was made of this being a parallel situation to the cases where women were in the past able to elect to pay for no pension but as i understand it this is not a parallel <e> <s> you would be either in your companys scheme or in a personal pension plan <e> <s> therefore the same situation will not arise <e> <s> it is important to appreciate that we are not envisaging here going back to the position where a woman would have no pension whatsoever at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> oh is it <e>", "<cs> as we are speaking to amendment no <e> <s> also i should like to take up the points made by the noble lord who was speaking a moment ago <e> <s> as i understand it one can pay anything one likes to any pension plan at the moment but one cannot have the tax advantages of doing so <e> <s> that is what amendment no <e> <s> is all about and that is what i should like to see <e> <s> i support the principle of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it would be a very good thing if we could persuade the chancellor to encourage people to make better provision for their old age through additional contributions <e> <s> there is no doubt that the way people will be encouraged to do so is by making some tax allowances towards it <e> <s> we saw what effect it had on life assurance when premium relief was removed <e> <s> it would be very pleasant if we could see some further tax relief allowed for people who wished to take either of the actions suggested in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if this debate will be among the other matters to be considered by the chancellor in due course then <e>", "<cs> that was a very interesting speech and we all agree that we want to see as much help as possible for the elderly <e> <s> but i do not think that this amendment is the way to do it <e> <s> the elderly certainly suffered terribly during the years of very high inflation when we had per cent <e> <s> inflation <e> <s> that is what cut back the savings that people had made for their old age people on a fixed income and they were terribly hard hit during those years <e> <s> this proposal as i see it would only perpetuate the poverty trap for the elderly and indeed for the whole of our society because it would mean increasing the rate of taxation in order to meet the additional financial commitment that is set out <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> i should like to come back again and say that to my mind if it is something which is given as a blanket hand-out to everyone it loses its merit because it is so uniform that it does not help those in real need <e>", "<cs> we seem to be dealing with some quite different amendments here but we are linking together amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i should like to comment in particular on both amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i think amendment no <e> <s> as worded is far too wide <e> <s> i must say that i do not agree at all with the noble viscount lord buckmaster about giving credit to people who are not resident in the united kingdom <e> <s> to me that is quite unbelievable <e> <s> i came here from another country fortunately at an age when i was at the beginning of my national health pension time but i would have found it a remarkably generous country if i had come some years later and i had been given years credit for the years when i was not resident in the uk <e> <s> that is the rather unbelievable category that is suggested here <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister inform the house why we do not disclose the amount of plutonium that we have exported to the united states under the defence agreement <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord possibly speak a little louder because the position he is in makes it difficult for us to hear or perhaps he can move nearer to a microphone <e> <s> i am afraid we are having quite a lot of difficulty in hearing him <e>", "<cs> i have great sympathy with the principle behind the amendment as i have always taken an active interest in disabled groups <e> <s> we have had a most encouraging reply from my noble friend the minister and i am sure that many who wish to support the amendment would encourage the noble lord lord henderson not to press it on this occasion <e> <s> i hope that something good comes out of the consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords i also welcome the announcement <e> <s> this is a matter that i have raised many times in the house <e> <s> on second reading of the social security bill i expressed the hope that the government might make such a statement before tomorrows decision it shows a generosity of spirit of which i consider the government absolutely capable <e> <s> i should also like to point out that this is just the last step <e> <s> when i first began on this road shortly after i arrived in this house in there were other tests for example the household duties test and there were other discriminations against women <e> <s> the government have been able to deal with those <e> <s> this was the last matter which was discriminatory <e> <s> my name is one of four names down on an amendment on this subject to the social security bill <e> <s> i am therefore very pleased about the announcement <e>", "<cs> i am concerned by the amendment as it stands because it seems to imply that parents would get both the and free school meals <e> <s> i imagine that if that were the situation it might upset the whole balance of the present calculations and might mean that there was some reduction in the family credit <e> <s> i would add my expression of pleasure to that of other members of the committee about the family credits being paid directly to the applicant who will normally be the mother <e> <s> that is an excellent thing and it is good that the mother will have this money in her hand <e>", "<cs> i do not understand this point about payment made for expenses incurred <e> <s> surely that would be just a direct reimbursement <e> <s> i know that in regard to payment of expenses in connection with work in the magistrates court or anywhere else where i have served if it is a reimbursement it is not considered a remuneration <e> <s> therefore surely we automatically disregard it rather than have it built into the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene here to explain to the committee that the phrase usually used in connection with reimbursements is expenses necessarily incurred in connection with whatever it happens to be <e>", "<cs> i rise simply to add my support to the amendment for the war widows <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord graham for moving the amendment which is an interesting one and i also thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i am not happy with the amendment as it stands because it seems to me that although very naturally it would be put forward by the association of county councils it is placing the onus on the trader and removing the onus from the inspectorate <e> <s> this of course would suit the county councils particularly in view of the less favourable points about the number of hours and whether the authority would be liable if the goods proved to be satisfactory <e> <s> so i can see that they have cause for concern <e>", "<cs> at the moment all appeal procedures take a long time <e> <s> i know that the noble and learned lord said that that was not too high a price to pay for the right of appeal <e> <s> if one is in urgent need it is far better to have that need met then and there <e>", "<cs> if i understand the proposal contained in the bill the first decision will be made by one special officer <e> <s> there will be a rapid appeal procedure to another and higher officer <e> <s> he will be a regional instead of a local officer <e> <s> am i wrong in that <e>", "<cs> i would like to respond to that point if i may <e> <s> i think i have a greater faith in the independence of these inspectors than the noble lord opposite seems to have in that i do believe in the independence of the civil service and i do not believe <e>", "<cs> on the last occasion that the committee met we heard from my noble friend lady faithfull about the refugees she helped in oxfordshire who bought i think five houses and paid back every penny of a loan <e>", "<cs> my lords i greatly enjoyed listening to the noble lord lord williams but more as an entertainment than anything else <e> <s> i rise to support the amendment of my noble friend lady macleod and i hope that my noble friend the minister will in his reply make clear that he does not wish to define too precisely some of the words and phrases as requested by the speaker from the opposition benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to see this amendment because i feel so strongly that there is need for local availability of people to deal with the problems of local consumers <e> <s> i should perhaps comment first on starred amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord lord diamond said it was unintelligible as printed on the marshalled list because i have looked at it and tried to puzzle over what it might mean <e> <s> it does not signify very much as it is printed there <e> <s> i accept the principle of what he said and i should like to assure him that the way in which these local district committees have operated in the past and the way in which local representatives would continue to operate is that there is always a list published and exhibited in the showroom of the local gas office or authority giving the name address and telephone number where that is appropriate if a number exists where the local person can be contacted <e> <s> strangely enough i found that i had finished on the gas consultative council by the time that everyone started to telephone me <e> <s> that was because there was delay in printing the lists <e> <s> i hope that will not happen again <e> <s> it is important that these lists should be available and we are hoping that it will be done at an early date <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister inform me whether the discussion paper will cover further the items which we discussed recently when this house passed the consumer safety amendment bill which he agreed was just a first step in this matter <e> <s> will this paper on fair trading cover this matter in a wider aspect <e> <s> if it does is my noble friend aware how welcome that would be <e>", "<cs> i rise to oppose this amendment and i should begin by declaring my position as an honorary vice-president of the building societies association but that in no way influences what i intend to say on this matter <e> <s> it would be quite impossible to build a social clause of this type into the building societies future <e> <s> i happen to be a member of the london electricity board and we went to france to see the situation there <e> <s> they have none of the social problems attached to their energy authorities that we have in this country <e> <s> the problems that are created by mixing a financial and business function with a social one are very great <e>", "<cs> my lords do not people have short memories <e> <s> the new deal with the coal board is welcome but people are entirely overlooking the fact that the electricity industry had to burn an enormous amount of expensive oil during the miners strike <e> <s> in the london board area alone that represented many millions of pounds of extra expenditure <e> <s> it was to recoup the losses in that period that the increase in april was announced <e> <s> as soon as the price of fuel used by the industry came down <e> <s> both <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the electricity industry have to buy its oil considerably in advance of usage <e> <s> for that reason the price change comes through at a later time <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is the question that has been asked <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell me how dental surgeons in prisons are remunerated <e> <s> is it on a salaried sessional basis <e> <s> is he aware that there is a greatly under-used capacity of national health dentistry available and that many general practitioners would welcome having suitable prisoners brought to their surgery for treatment as i do myself to help to fill the gaps <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are some forms of treatment which it would be unsatisfactory for one dentist safely to leave to another to complete <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us the amount owing in rent arrears in the london area for council accommodation and whether anything can be done to resolve a situation which is unfair to those tenants who are paying their rent <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think we should under-estimate the interests of the energy authorities in promoting energy efficiency <e> <s> i do not see that it is necessary to write anything further into the bill <e> <s> only within the last few weeks there was a major display of combined gas and electricity authorities in the guildhall and that concerned energy efficiency in business <e> <s> that is only one of many energy efficiency displays that i have attended recently <e> <s> i believe these industries are very well aware of the need for efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not the same problem to a large extent that we have with british industry <e> <s> for a long time british industry has been unwilling to go out and sell its own products and it is asking too much to put the obligation on the gas authority to go out and approach british industry <e> <s> i think that the manufacturers in this country ought to be so competitive and so good that the contract should automatically go to them <e> <s> i do not think it should be necessary to write this condition into the bill <e> <s> sadly all too often i am forced to buy overseas products simply because british manufacturers will not update their products or frankly they do not care about the market <e> <s> i think it is up to british manufacturers to take a more positive approach <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will allow me i did not complain about the inefficiency of british industry <e> <s> my point was that it should be competitive <e> <s> i am a strong supporter of british industry <e> <s> i believe that british industry should produce the best value and best designed goods <e> <s> there would then be no need to consider british manufacturers because they would automatically be best <e> <s> i take exception to the noble lords description of me as claiming that british industry was inefficient <e> <s> i did not claim that <e> <s> i claimed that we have never been good enough at selling our goods <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in favour of the amendment and i cannot see the need to protect the electricity industry in the way stated <e> <s> i am a member of the london electricity board and we are well aware that there will be differences when gas is privatised <e> <s> but i thought that the concerns were more that skilled staff might be attracted by better salaries in the gas industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord lord diamond pressing the amendment or withdrawing it <e> <s> we have i feel had due discussion on it <e> <s> i have noticed since coming into the chamber that the noble lord has spoken more times than is normal at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is the second time the mover of this amendment has spoken it is the occasion on which he should be either pressing the amendment or withdrawing it <e> <s> he did not ask the leave of the house to ask a question or to intervene a second time <e> <s> therefore i think it important that he now makes clear whether he is pressing the amendment or withdrawing it <e>", "<cs> it is your amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i think that this amendment is totally wrong <e> <s> first of all this clause covers work such as the laying of a pipe which might involve a very large sum of money <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the poorest people would not benefit from this proposal <e> <s> as i explained in committee when the rebate system for low usage was introduced it was found that it did not benefit poor people and it was discontinued <e> <s> the amendment would not be to the benefit of the poor <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have liked to comment very briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the problem with this amendment is that it is completely out of date <e> <s> by the time the bill is prepared it is totally ignoring the move within the industry away from meter reading altogether to remote meter reading and to prepayment by card that will be calibrated right at the source <e> <s> i therefore think it very wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the house whether the fact that this matter was discussed previously but not decided means that it may come back for further discussion today or whether it should simply be moved <e> <s> i should like briefly to comment that this amendment if accepted would be inhibitory in terms of all advances and improvements that are definitely about to take place in terms of remote meter reading and coinless meters <e> <s> i therefore oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to oppose this amendment <e> <s> it unfortunately is rather out of touch and out of date <e> <s> this appeared to be a good idea and i myself thought it might be although of course it might have resulted in loss of jobs <e> <s> i took up this matter with the gas authority as recently as two weeks ago <e> <s> they say that although this has been discussed millions of times in the past it has been an old chestnut coming up again and again they think it will never happen because now the move is towards remote meter reading where no one will need to get access into your home at all and the meter would be read long distance <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose this amendment very strongly as i believe that it would create a cumbersome time-consuming and expensive procedure that would rebound on all gas consumers <e> <s> it is essential for the gas authority to retain disconnection as the ultimate way of dealing with non-payment <e> <s> as i have mentioned at previous stages of the bill in the energy industry bad debts are one of the really great worries <e> <s> i have already quoted the case of the electricity industry which has millions of pounds of bad debts in the london area alone <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend should ask leave of the house to speak again <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene on this point to say that at the last meeting of the electricity council which i attended one of the items on the agenda was consideration of a return to historic cost accounting and this is becoming very common throughout industry <e>", "<cs> my lords one point must be made clear with regard to historic cost and current cost accounting because all sorts of devious motives have been attributed to their use <e> <s> i remind the house that current cost accounting became common in business because of the vast rates of inflation which when at their highest reached the level of per cent <e> <s> under a labour government <e> <s> that is what caused current cost accounting to be brought into existence <e> <s> now that inflation is right down business is returning to current cost accounting because it is now possible to replace ones assets at a realistic figure without that horrible element of inflation <e>", "<cs> i know that my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the point that the noble lord made but my own point also has to be acknowledged <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the amendment worrying because it singles out one category and i do not think that it would work in the interests of women in particular those who have given up work to be at home with their children <e> <s> they are covered for the time they are at home but if a woman wished to return to work part time she would be disadvantaged more by that because that would be included in the period of employment and yet it would lower her average earnings over the years <e> <s> there would be every incentive for her not to return to work but simply to sign the form saying that she was available for work <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to oppose this amendment because i think it is misguided <e> <s> i am a great supporter of help for families with children <e> <s> indeed my father was the first minister of health in the new south wales state government to introduce what was then called child endowment <e> <s> i believe that he was the only minister in the world for health and motherhood <e>", "<cs> my lords i am slightly confused by this amendment <e> <s> i feel i do not fully understand what it would do and having listened to the debate on it there are a few questions i should like to ask of those who support it <e> <s> the noble lord lord stallard mentioned that so many mistakes had been discovered <e> <s> to me that indicates that there is already some good way of finding out when things have gone wrong <e> <s> if that is so why do we need another procedure of this type <e> <s> there are a few points in his speech that i should like to query <e> <s> i take issue with one in which he said that a panel of three local councillors would not necessarily be impartial or fair <e> <s> i think that is not correct <e> <s> a panel of three locally elected councillors will always represent at least two parties and possibly more <e> <s> they can be completely relied on to judge a case fairly and on its merits <e> <s> i really must stand up for local authority and locally elected members to that extent <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very interesting amendment in that it more or less takes us to the situation where we would hope a great deal of money would be given to those mothers in real need as opposed to a general handout to everyone <e> <s> but although i am in sympathy with the merits of the amendment i cannot see that it should be necessary because i understood that the whole principle of this bill was that by not giving out blanket handouts to everyone there would be more for cases of real need <e> <s> if that is so then i believe that that will happen and we do not need to add this little bit of text to the bill <e> <s> i hope that the minister when she replies will be able to assure us that cases will be dealt with on their merits <e>", "<cs> my lords as my name is on the later amendment no <e> <s> which we shall not now be moving i feel that i too would like to thank the minister for this amendment <e> <s> when in the past i think in my first year in this house i raised this issue in an unstarred question the government then indicated that they would very much like to do it but that it was a very heavy financial commitment <e> <s> i am only too delighted that now we have reached the point were it is actually coming about <e> <s> all the good things have been said <e> <s> i will not delay the house more <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for bringing forward this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his comments and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his remarks and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his comments and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not being in the house when the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs commenced moving this amendment <e> <s> it always comes up a little late on the monitor by comparison with what one is watching for <e> <s> however i am not sure that i am in support of this amendment because i think it will unnecessarily complicate the administration <e> <s> i should prefer to see the amount given as the meals supplement to be adequate to cover this without necessarily introducing the further administrative process which would be involved <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that funds remain available at this moment and that a meeting of the appeal committee of the london boroughs grants sub-committee is to take place on th july <e> <s> is it not also a fact that with the labour control that is being exercised even under the chairmanship of an alliance chairman still very left-wing bodies are being funded while some good causes are being refused <e> <s> will the noble lord comment upon the grant that was refused to the hotel and catering industry training board a scheme that was agreed with the trade unions and the manpower services commission that was previously funded by the glc under the top-up scheme and that was recommended by the officers for a grant of <e> <s> will he comment on the fact that this was refused whereas others and i shall name them <e>", "<cs> i have to look at this to be accurate my lords whereas others were passed <e> <s> this is i believe very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like then to come back on a second question <e> <s> i was going to ask why such things were refused when the lesbian line and the black lesbian gay group are still being given their grant <e>", "<cs> my lords only one of those speakers was from our party <e> <s> i should like to draw the noble lords attention to that fact <e> <s> the other was a cross-bencher <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome part i of the bill because i remember so clearly when my husband contracted salmonella abroad and was admitted to an isolation hospital that he found that all the other patients there had contracted salmonella after being admitted to hospital <e> <s> it is good to know that clause will deal with that <e>", "<cs> my lords that shows that the noble lord has never been in national health practice because i can tell you that that is not so at all <e> <s> usually those lay people gang up very hard against the professional people and i think you would find those four to be fairly effective <e> <s> to quote him what he said was that they would be an effective veto <e> <s> he did not actually say that three was a majority <e> <s> he said that they would be an effective veto <e> <s> i just followed the argument through <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble minister for his reply <e> <s> having had down an unstarred question on this topic for the whole year and now this starred question for the last four weeks does he not think it fortuitous that he is able to give me such a happy and marvellous reply on this last day of term <e> <s> i thank him <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister also confirm that if these recommendations have the effect that we expect they will result in considerable saving of public inconvenience and public money <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a highly emotional subject and of course rightly so because unless we arouse peoples feelings and interest to the extent that is necessary we shall not have the disease contained and people in general sufficiently aware of the need to take precautions <e> <s> hiv human immuno-deficiency virus infection includes aids <e> <s> the word aids is applied when it becomes the full-blown disease and at that stage per cent <e> <s> of people affected die within three years <e> <s> but there is a much larger number of people who are carriers known or not known people who are infected with this virus <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister comment on whether the million cost is on the assumption that everyone will receive the syringes free or has it taken into account the fact that the prescription charge is a fairly high one <e>", "<cs> i find this a slightly worrying suggestion as those of us who have travelled overseas recently have discovered that anyone can get anything with a fake hallmark or a name of any sort on it <e> <s> indeed if you go to singapore you can buy any sort of fake watch and watches are sold as being fake watches <e> <s> but how then does someone later prove that a hinge which has a very small mark on it was genuinely made by someone and was not made by someone else who was faking it <e>", "<cs> i find this section very difficult to remove although i appreciate the moral point that has been made <e> <s> this is a matter that has been discussed quite often at united nations womens meetings which i have attended <e> <s> for example some poorer african countries would like to obtain very simple types of dental anaesthetics which we no longer produce in this country because we have progressed to a sophisticated single cartridge individual type of anaesthetic <e> <s> because those poorer countries cannot afford such products and are not capable of that degree of sophistication they end up with nothing <e> <s> patients either have pain or have their teeth extracted without an anaesthetic <e> <s> representatives from those countries have come here to discuss these matters <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply briefly to that point <e> <s> in terms of dental anaesthetics we in this country would no longer accept what was always used years ago a large bottle from which one filled ones syringe for each individual patient <e> <s> now with aids we should not entertain that idea <e> <s> we should not consider anything but a disposable needle <e> <s> but people in those other countries could not entertain the idea of having a disposable needle or a sealed cartridge <e> <s> to us such a situation would not be acceptable <e> <s> but the dilemma that one finds oneself in is which is more acceptable to have no anaesthetic or to have one which unless the proper sterilisation technique is carried out could be considered unsafe <e> <s> by our standards we would not accept that situation any longer <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether as my amendment is more or less on the same point it would be convenient to the committee to speak on this matter and deal with the two amendments together <e> <s> the points that have been made concerning the gas cookers are relevant and real <e> <s> the electric cooker situation according to the london electricity board of which i am a member is not so serious <e> <s> most electrical appliances unless they are very old are fused <e> <s> the fuse blows long before there is any injury to the person <e> <s> the electrical devices are designed in such a way as to be fail-safe <e> <s> of course it is not very satisfactory from the point of view of use but the safety element is not such a problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord bottomley for bringing such an interesting subject to us today <e> <s> i listened very carefully to his introduction although of course i do not agree with many of the points that he made <e> <s> i thought it was most interesting that the noble lord lord smith made the point about pay beds because i think that is a highly relevant factor in what has happened to the health service <e> <s> indeed it is often said that the people in harley street believe they should almost erect a statue to that secretary of state and a socialist one i might add because she did more to push the private sector ahead than anyone else ever had <e> <s> of course that was not her intention <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord lord scarman for giving us the opportunity today of this debate which is of great interest to so many of us <e> <s> i know how delighted most of the members of your lordships house will be that we have reached the point where i am the last back-bench speaker in what has been a very long debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for introducing this bill to us <e> <s> i should like to clarify a point relating to the opening remarks of the noble baroness lady david when she said that only one noble lord who spoke last wednesday on the subject of local government was speaking tonight <e> <s> i think the comment was confused <e> <s> there were many speakers last wednesday on what i understand was a very good but very long debate <e> <s> i was not one of those speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords i would accept that that is exactly what the noble baroness said but i considered that it was slightly ambiguous and could be interpreted that only one speaker tonight was one of the speakers who had spoken on wednesday <e> <s> i just wanted to make that point quite clear <e> <s> i thought that possibly those who had spoken last wednesday found that it was such a long late night that they could not face it again <e> <s> i had been involved in the inner cities debate on the monday and for that reason i did not speak in the debate on wednesday <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble and learned lord that we shall have a good committee stage on this bill when we will go into the detail of all these points being raised tonight <e> <s> my own experience in local government has been that different people can decide when different expenditures will be claimable or allowable or by clever means one can move funds from one account to another <e> <s> in this way it is possible to get around the ruling <e> <s> for that reason i support a more specific list <e> <s> basically my support for this bill is because there was a general consensus in the past about relevant and total expenditure <e> <s> those are the two key options in the local government finance system <e> <s> when legislation was drawn up in the past the advice of the local authority associations was sought and given <e> <s> indeed no one would wish to accuse them of giving their advice in anything but the best faith <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether the authority about which she is speaking is the highest spending and least effective authority in the whole country <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend tell me how many people she expects to benefit from the new proposals <e>", "<cs> i wish to oppose this amendment and support the government mainly because of the report of the general purposes committee of the london boroughs association which has considered this bill quite carefully <e> <s> the association expresses a number of concerns <e> <s> in particular it is worried that in trying to control the bad people in local government one may damage the good ones <e> <s> however the sentence i wish to read to the committee is from the associations minutes and i think it is highly relevant <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i was called from the chamber and that i was not here when the amendment was introduced <e> <s> i have however heard a great deal of discussion including a rather emotional speech concerning ilea and what might be the effect of rate-capping on ilea <e> <s> i believe that ilea has to be continually rate-capped if inner london is to survive at all in terms of its resident population certainly until such time as the rating system may be changed <e>", "<cs> when i was in the chamber earlier this afternoon i thought i heard the minister say that it was not correct that there would be no help for ilea to meet the teachers pay awards <e> <s> perhaps we could ask him to repeat that <e> <s> i was here and i thought he made the statement that ilea would not go unaided <e>", "<cs> i find the point made by the noble lord interesting <e> <s> i think he is referring to the recent audit report which we debated <e> <s> i agree with what he said about that but we had another report some months earlier which stated that ilea was the most expensive and least effective education authority in the country in other words the worst value for money <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend explain the position before the obtaining of a provisional licence <e> <s> is it simply a situation of paying your money and taking delivery of a motor cycle or is some degree of skill and training required at that stage <e> <s> surely that is of even more concern <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend not agree that in a motor car one is not allowed to ride or drive unaccompanied during the period of the holding of a provisional licence and that that is a very different situation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister whether that is true about blood products in particular gamma globulin which is of concern to many people going abroad who have to have anti-hepatitis injections <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that in the metropolitan area to which this question refers <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell us where the ratepayers stand in this <e> <s> is there any possibility of these debts falling back on them or are they protected under the rate-capping legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that cost is a very big factor in that it goes on to the consumers electricity account in the end <e> <s> that is significant and it is another reason why we should not want to put everything underground <e> <s> i speak as a member of the london electricity board the services of which are entirely underground and did not suffer any damage but those cables were placed at great cost <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the regional electricity boards in this country have been able to offer some small reductions to their largest industrial consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to the speech of the right reverend prelate <e> <s> all of us in this house have a great understanding of his financial responsibilities and obligations to the church

<e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> i quoted the right reverend prelate as saying that the space was safe in their hands <e> <s> i did not say that it was safe in our hands <e> <s> if he checks <e>", "<cs> my lords much has been said about the poorest children in london and about how they may be disadvantaged by the abolition of ilea <e> <s> can the minister inform us that she is aware as i believe she is that these are the people who are being so disadvantaged now <e> <s> the children in the poorest part of islington i speak as someone who has practised in that area over a long period are almost unemployable <e> <s> if one asks them to put a dozen forms into alphabetical order they cannot <e> <s> these are school-leavers <e> <s> eighty-five per cent <e> <s> cannot put or forms into alphabetical order <e> <s> this means that ilea has failed those poor children and when there is a clear option for boroughs such as westminster with which i am closely connected to opt out they will certainly do so and there will remain a hopelessly ill-formed ilea <e> <s> it will be only the worst of ilea <e> <s> certainty is absolutely essential in these circumstances <e> <s> certainty and rapid change are important <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the amendment being moved by the noble lord lord banks and i find these words available to render assistance far too vague <e> <s> i do not think it is at all clear what that means i prefer the original text <e> <s> i thought that the earlier amendment to leave out substantial had certain merits but that does not apply to this amendment <e> <s> i think that it weakens the whole idea and i do not think that it is at all appropriate <e> <s> available to render assistance could mean anything at

patients have died in surgeries and staff have been described as being available to render assistance but they were not available even in time to run in and save someones life <e> <s> i certainly do not support the amendment <e>", "<cs> do we have any idea of the number of young people between the ages of and who would fall into the categories in question <e> <s> i apologise if that point has already been covered but it would be helpful to know the answer <e> <s> i am also interested to know whether the degree of discretion given under subsection ab would cover them all <e> <s> there is no doubt that there are genuine cases but there are also many where a persons main disability is his or her unwillingness to do any work <e> <s> that is particularly so in london now where one cannot get

the situation where five juniors applied for and accepted jobs and a starting date having been fixed none of them arrived for work at a national health service practice <e> <s> one is left in despair

feel strongly about this matter <e> <s> i do not know whether the situation is entirely different outside london or whether the situation there should be treated differently by the department <e> <s> however in london the problem is not of young people losing their jobs but of young people walking out of their jobs <e> <s> i can tell the committee of eight young people employed in the last year all of whom have left their jobs <e> <s> shortly afterwards the employer received a note stating that they wished to claim unemployment benefit <e> <s> they are not prepared to return to work even if firms desperately need staff <e> <s> i think that something is terribly wrong with that situation <e>", "<cs> i am afraid the last statement made by the minister worries me <e> <s> he said if a job is lost or left <e> <s> i have every sympathy for someone who has lost a job but i have no sympathy for someone who has left a job unless there is good reason for leaving <e> <s> if working conditions are intolerable or ones health is not up to an all-day standing job as referred to by the noble lord lord henderson those are good reasons <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble baroness to clarify her remarks when she referred to the appeals that she had heard <e> <s> is it not only a period of delay rather than a period of loss in which payment of benefits is deferred <e> <s> i understood that after a period had elapsed full benefit was paid <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister inform me whether there still exists provision for recruitment in health education because surely there is a great need for further recruitment within the nursing and medical professions <e> <s> in the past films were used <e> <s> can the minister say whether that facility can still be funded through the health education council <e>", "<cs> i know that my noble friend has the answer to that question and so perhaps i should let her give it first <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall answer that question for my noble friend <e> <s> as i understand it there will be a yts place guaranteed for everyone between the ages of and <e> <s> i have taken on board all the points about those who are slow developers or

potential that different young people have <e> <s> i pay great tribute to the speech made by my noble friend lady carnegy of lour <e> <s> she was flying the flag for the highest standards and the best possible achievement <e> <s> that is what we should like to see of our young people in this country <e> <s> but we all know too the young people desperately underprivileged who have lived under appalling conditions or under neglected conditions <e> <s> if we can get those young people also to develop their best potential through a youth training scheme suited to their abilities and their background so much the better <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure me that the department casts a careful eye on those buildings to be preserved <e> <s> having preserved most of the buildings

essential in all traffic control <e> <s> will my noble friend review the bus lanes in london which were sprinkled everywhere by the late greater london council <e> <s> they often operate during hours when there are no buses using them to the detriment of other traffic <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many of us are concerned about charities that do not give sufficient of their proceeds to other bodies for which they are intentionally raising the money <e> <s> is he aware of the degree of concern about the number of bodies applying to register as charities about many of which we have doubts <e> <s> is it not time that there was a general review and reclassification of charities into those that are genuine and those that are not <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose the amendment <e> <s> i support the views of my noble friend lord selkirk that one should either train or be in work <e> <s> this was discussed thoroughly at the last stage of the bill <e> <s> it was clear that there would be provisions for exemption where necessary <e> <s> the amendment is very detailed and i am not able to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that there is a complex interrelationship between sheltered housing the social services and health services for the elderly <e> <s> is it not time that we started to co-ordinate these matters so that each authority or each body responsible for funding is not busily trying to move the expense on to the next body <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the dental profession is very pleased with the new video on preventive dentistry <e> <s> that of course forms part of the nhs services <e> <s> are the government giving any thought to providing facilities <e> <s> the very people who most need updating in their profession are those least likely to have a machine on which to view the new video <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether the same injustices will occur with the uniform business rate in scotland in large cities with commuter populations <e> <s> or will the problem arise only in london and the south where inner cities will be adversely affected by low resident population and high commuter population and the full business rate will go into a central pool <e>", "<cs> my lords as a practising national health dentist who has been in practice for a long time you would of course expect me to speak upon dental matters <e> <s> however before doing so i wish to make a few points on behalf of the general practitioners and interestingly a slightly reverse point on behalf of the royal college of nursing <e>", "<cs> when the minister replies will he please clarify this point <e> <s> as i have listened to the debate it seems to me that some members of the committee are implying that local authorities will no longer have the discretion to waive the rates for charities <e> <s> at least that was the way that i interpreted the comments of my noble friend lady blatch just now <e> <s> but perhaps i misunderstood and that is why i ask for clarification <e>", "<cs> is this the appropriate moment for me to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i listened to the ministers comments on amendment no <e> <s> a but i am not sure that they really make any difference to my own view and to my wish to see my amendment agreed to rather than that of my noble friend <e> <s> i am somewhat concerned that although this amendment gives all sorts of powers according to the regulations nothing is spelt out or in any way made clear as to what that means <e> <s> as those regulations are not before us and nothing is known about them it makes it very difficult to comment on that point at this stage <e>", "<cs> i thank the members of the committee for their comments <e> <s> the latest figures that are available are the figures from the office of population censuses and surveys <e> <s> that means that even the figures i am quoting will be almost years out of date by the time the bill comes into force <e> <s> but it is clearly very unjust for people through their community charge to bear the very heavy expenses of the services that have to be provided not only for themselves but for the additional people a day <e> <s> westminster city council gets no rate support grant and indeed it pays an equalisation levy to help poorer boroughs in london of million <e> <s> but there is an assessment for <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the way in which this matter has been dealt with means that i am entitled now to speak to amendment no <e> <s> although if amendment no <e> <s> a is accepted i shall not be able to divide the committee on my amendment <e> <s> i had not intended to divide it on the amendment but i want to hear the governments answer on the matter <e>", "<cs> as your lordships know i cannot press or even move my amendment although as it happens in a strange way amendments nos <e> <s> a and have come together <e> <s> but i should like to thank those members who have spoken on the amendment because they have made the point very clearly to the minister and i hope and believe that he will now go away and think more on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that a desirable side effect of neighbourhood watch has been a return to people knowing their neighbours helping each other in a community spirit and assisting some elderly people who might have been very alone <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that detailed reply <e> <s> i cannot say that i am particularly happy with many of the points that he made <e> <s> for example i refer to his statement that so far as the arts go those boroughs that are now funding them and which wish to continue may do so <e> <s> when the community charge is introduced any borough which wants to do something will be able to but it will certainly be at the risk of unpopularity with its voters if it means that more money is to be taken from the pockets of local residents <e> <s> in the case of westminster i believe that the funding of the english national opera and the london festival ballet represents per head of what our residents will be paying <e> <s> many of them never had the opportunity to visit these places <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that is correct but i do not wish to take issue with the noble lord about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> however the situation is that after the abolition of the present system there will be a different situation <e> <s> if the same million has to be found for the arts we shall no longer be saving anything under the london equalisation scheme because that scheme goes when the community charge is introduced <e> <s> i understand the point that is being made <e> <s> if the situation at the present time is that the sum of million is being deducted from what westminster contributed to the london equalisation scheme i wonder whether the minister can confirm that that is the exact amount then i accept the point that at the moment the residents of westminster are not paying <e> <s> after the abolition of the equalisation scheme residents will pay million <e> <s> my mathematics are poor but that works out at around a head <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is to be a new equalisation scheme then for the first time westminster might be getting something out instead of always paying in <e> <s> perhaps that will be a help <e> <s> we have not discussed any new equalisation scheme <e> <s> it has certainly not come up during the time we have been discussing the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be large problems <e> <s> if the government answer in the way they say they intend to and take into account all the needs i believe westminster may be covered in the way the noble lord lord graham has said <e> <s> i am prepared to consider the matter carefully and will not press the amendment tonight <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i find this a most interesting and innovative bill <e> <s> i believe that many of the provisions in it will be of great benefit to people who wish to rent property <e> <s> as regards private landlords one of the great difficulties has always been an almost complete lack of understanding of the private landlord on the part of the labour party <e>", "<cs> if the examination is free there is no excuse for not going <e> <s> there is then no cash deterrent for the patient <e> <s> the amendment is simple <e> <s> it merely opposes the introduction of charging for a dental examination <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i understand that when my noble friend lord colwyn moved an amendment earlier in committee on this bill the principle was accepted that school children needed dental screening and that that meant an examination <e> <s> therefore it has already been accepted by members of the committee that a dental examination is a form of screening <e> <s> i certainly so consider it <e> <s> i was quite disturbed to hear the view of my noble friend lord trafford that there was no reason in the world why screening should continue to be free <e> <s> that was the message that i received from his speech <e> <s> it is worrying if my noble friend is suggesting that this is only the tip of the iceberg and that we may find a charge for all other screenings <e> <s> the point is made even more importantly <e> <s> if this is the first charge for any form of screening or examination in the health service then this will decide the future of all other types of screening that we have to consider <e>", "<cs> i understood the deputy chairman to say that amendment no <e> <s> could not be moved if amendment no <e> <s> was agreed to <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that most medical practitioners indeed i believe all on the national health list receive circulars from the department which clearly set out the side effects of any drug of this type <e> <s> moreover general practitioners now particularly the newer ones will have undergone an additional three years vocational training which is of enormous value <e> <s> i am sure the remark about not trusting doctors will not be upheld by most members in this house <e>", "<cs> i take a different view on the matter from the noble lord lord ross of newport <e> <s> he says that rents in kensington are a week or thereabouts <e> <s> of course they are but what is the noble lord saying <e> <s> i could point to rents in the area ranging from up to a week <e> <s> rents range over all prices <e> <s> what i think is not understood by the opposition in particular is that people are not willing to let a place if they have to undergo the hassle of involvement with a rent assessment officer <e> <s> they are prepared to agree a price with the tenant strike a bargain and everybody is perfectly happy about it <e> <s> the alternative is to have the threat hanging over ones head that one will be taken to a rent assessment officer <e>", "<cs> i take the opportunity of raising this point because we have reached this subject although it is more related to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> there is a real issue to be considered on where a marriage breaks up <e> <s> it is important that the tenancy right should remain with the spouse who has the children <e> <s> another point concerns the need to change the tenancy from husband to wife or from wife to husband depending on who has the children and who remains in the property <e> <s> if it is necessary to change the tenancy from say husband to wife it is important that it should not count as a new letting <e> <s> that would make a considerable difference <e> <s> the existing and protected tenancy would be changed completely in character <e>", "<cs> i ask the noble lord to give way <e> <s> the noble lord is saying that if this bill becomes law people will have nowhere to go <e> <s> people have nowhere to go now and that is the whole purpose of this bill <e> <s> it is to make available housing that does not exist at the present moment <e> <s> i believe this to be a point that the noble lord is overlooking <e> <s> we also have failed to remind ourselves that this bill applies only to property that is not already occupied or let <e> <s> we are talking about new lettings and places that are not available now <e> <s> i believe that this bill must increase the supply of accommodation and that an amendment of the kind that the noble lord is supporting will only prevent that happening <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer that question <e> <s> in london all the rents were determined over this period <e> <s> it is only recently that london rents have been derestricted <e> <s> outside london we did not have those restrictions and lettings were more successful <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to speak again on this amendment but i feel that i must take up the issue raised by the noble lord lord jay <e> <s> that issue was debated so many times during the years when i was a member of the greater london council namely the magic that because you have more council rented accommodation you have more vacancies <e> <s> that is not necessarily so <e> <s> people who are occupying a council flat are occupying that flat whether they are renting it or whether they own it <e> <s> i still hold the belief that they are entitled to own it <e> <s> therefore i do not accept his argument that if we turn them all into rented properties tomorrow there would be many more of them available <e>", "<cs> i too should like to ask a question about schedule <e> <s> i wish to refer to paragraph tenancies of dwellinghouses with high rateable values <e> <s> the paragraph refers to a dwellinghouse having a rateable value -for the time being <e> <s> what will happen after the community charge becomes operative and the rateable value vanishes <e> <s> what will the basis then be <e> <s> not every property that comes up for rent will necessarily have a rateable value assessed <e> <s> if people alter or add to the building under the present system the rateable value would have varied <e> <s> i wonder how that matter will be dealt with <e> <s> i do not necessarily require a reply now <e> <s> i believe that it is a matter that should be considered in the bill <e>", "<cs> the act says <e>", "<cs> i must respond to the comment of the noble earl lord lytton <e> <s> in an ideal world where all husbands and wives got along marvellously and men really thought about what might happen to their wives they might give due notice that they were now married and they would like their wife to have equal rights <e> <s> they might have a joint tenancy which is something that i should like to see more couples have <e> <s> however there are many situations in which that does not happen <e>", "<cs> i do not support the amendment <e> <s> however i recognise that there is a very real situation in which a landlord may be losing a lot of money <e> <s> i wonder whether the courts are allowed to award interest for the period that the rent was not received and if that is not so whether it could be considered <e>", "<cs> i am not happy with the amendment as suggested or with harassment <e> <s> i believe the bill will make it easier for people to obtain legitimate possession in legitimate cases <e> <s> it is creating kinds of tenancies that as i have said before should make available a wider rental market <e> <s> i believe it is even more important that in such cases which remain protected people have adequate protection <e>", "<cs> i have very strong views on this subject <e> <s> they are quite different from those expressed by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> in the first place this lack of protection is to be in a place with a resident landlord <e> <s> that was the first category that he covered <e> <s> i believe that the intention in taking away the present condition is to encourage people to let a portion of a property which they are not willing to let at present because of the restrictions and the problems that they would face <e> <s> if through this change in the law we bring about a great increase in the number of people willing to share their accommodation i believe that is good <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the whole purpose of having planning procedures is to retain a living city <e> <s> the suggestions that any current use should continue for ever as <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for his comments <e> <s> i am interested in what he had to say <e> <s> he is not necessarily right in saying that my amendment is a ring-fencing measure <e> <s> in reading my amendment i think that the ring-fencing would depend on the terms of the licence and the terms under which licences are granted <e> <s> it would not necessarily exclude other people <e> <s> therefore the ring-fencing element might not be the right attitude and not be implicit in my amendment <e> <s> if my noble friend the minister is <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who is strongly in favour of free screening for dentistry and eyes nevertheless i voted for this amendment in committee <e> <s> the two aspects are not in conflict <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals fails to realise that there is a large number of people who never go for any sort of test no matter what the test is <e> <s> those are the people who will be greatly helped by being able to buy glasses off the shelf <e> <s> those are the people one now sees walking about with a large magnifying glass in their hands or hung around their necks <e> <s> instead they will be able to buy magnifying glasses which they stick on their noses which will be much more comfortable and they will be able to use their hands <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak with great regret at the position we face today over the amendment because it was my amendment that was passed by this house in july <e> <s> the whole dental profession looks on this as a very retrogressive move <e> <s> in that splendid opening speech made by the leader of the house the one misleading phrase suggested that we would be forced to offer free dental examinations <e> <s> that is the present situation <e> <s> it is not a case of being forced to offer free examinations they exist now and this provision takes them away <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for bringing this bill to us <e> <s> it is a most interesting bill and i look forward to the committee stage <e> <s> i apologise to the house in that although i hope to stay if speeches are not too long so as to hear the ministers reply i am committed to an annual general meeting and must leave at a certain time <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the london area it is extremely difficult to recruit staff and that many employers are constantly advertising at great expense and are still unable to find anyone <e> <s> what can be done to change the regional maldistribution which means high unemployment in some areas and such a shortage of skilled and unskilled people in london <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell us whether there are elected members of the general optical council in the same way as there are for the general dental council following the new dental legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether his department is doing anything to ensure that those on the national consumer council have among their number people with an interest and knowledge in health matters <e>", "<cs> i thank those who have supported me in the amendment and contributed to the valuable discussion <e> <s> i feel that i must take up one or two of the points made by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> i was not suggesting that everyone who had an eyesight test would have to send that to the dvlc rather it would be the equivalent after an accident of being asked by the police to produce the mot form if relevant the driving licence and certificate of insurance <e> <s> it would be on those occasions that one would produce ones eyesight test so it would not be adding to the burden of the dvlc <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment as the committee would expect <e> <s> but i think that it is taking the measure a little too late <e> <s> however it is better to take it late than not at all <e> <s> the provision might prevent the same person having a further accident <e> <s> so it has that merit <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment <e> <s> i speak from direct personal experience as a mother in that my daughter bought quite a large and powerful motorbike when she was a medical student and i considered that it was very important for her to have proper training to ride it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the support which has been expressed <e> <s> i am sorry that there was a degree of confusion at the beginning when it seemed to some members of the committee that we were still on the subject of motorcycles <e> <s> this was a new clause and therefore quite detached from the motorcycle issue <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend explain whether the appointments to these boards will be people from different categories of professions or lay people <e> <s> can he assure me that various professions such as the dentists will not fall between two stools failing to be allocated a professional place and at the same time being ruled out as lay members <e> <s> can the minister further elaborate on the means of nomination that he has mentioned <e> <s> the noble earl said that nominations as non-executive directors will be welcomed from all sources <e> <s> does he mean that members of the public will be able to apply <e> <s> what about members of <e>", "<cs> my lords can i bring my noble friend back to my question which he did not answer <e> <s> i asked him to elaborate on his phrase that nominations for the non-executive directorships could come from all sources presumably including local authorities <e> <s> i wish the noble earl to answer the question as to what arc the all sources or at least a few of the sources to which he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended to reserve my comments for later amendments <e> <s> the minister said at the previous stage that he would give us the results of research <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to say that i have now received a copy of the results of that research into eyesight <e> <s> i shall leave it to the minister to say whether that has been made available to other members of the house <e> <s> it makes clear to me that although research has been undertaken a lot more is still required <e> <s> i think that the points made by the spokesman for the opposition are quite correct <e> <s> research needs to be much wider than eyesight testing in terms of the ability to read a number plate <e> <s> this is a very wide issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> i also thank all those who have contributed to the debate on this amendment <e> <s> the fact that my noble friend has been able to reassure me that powers already exist and require only secondary legislation is highly significant in my decision not to press the amendment <e> <s> had primary legislation been required this would have been the time to consider it <e> <s> however i note that secondary legislation can be brought forward at a later point and that the department is prepared to watch these figures <e> <s> as my noble friend said there are million drivers aged over and with our changing pattern of life there will be more every year <e> <s> not all have the degree of judgment to give up driving as did the noble lord lord jenkins because of his loss of ability to judge distances <e> <s> it is highly relevant that people should be aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very disappointed that further primary legislation would be needed as i think that means we really must consider the matter in this bill <e> <s> i agree with the noble viscount lord falkland about the speed limit because in london as well as in britain generally we find it a great problem if someone is going too slowly <e> <s> i notice that it is often a reason for refusing someone a licence if he cannot keep up with the general flow of traffic which creates a hazard <e> <s> i think that the amendment is therefore defective in some respects <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the london local authorities no <e> <s> bill is promoted by the city of westminster on behalf of all the london boroughs excluding the city of london which always handles its own bills separately <e> <s> the bill is a mixture of items <e> <s> no one borough has sought to have all the powers listed in the bill but each power is sought by one or more boroughs <e> <s> the bill is supported by the association of london authorities and the london boroughs association <e> <s> it results from occurrences in different parts of london which have made people realise that powers are needed to give what many believe is an essential control or to give residents desirable protection <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all those who have taken part in the <e>", "<cs> which is safer <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that that is safer especially for a woman <e> <s> to be down several floors can be a hazard <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased that this debate has suddenly speeded up a little as i am speaking at a dinner and i must unfortunately leave within a certain time <e> <s> i had thought the debate was going so slowly that i would not have the opportunity to say anything <e> <s> after years in the national health service i would have been very disappointed if that had happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord jenkin of roding for having referred to the fact that westminster city council has views on this matter <e> <s> i have been asked to speak on this bill by two petitioners westminster city council and the paddington residents active concern in transport known as pract <e>", "<cs> my lords i see <e> <s> the councils figures show a much lower number <e> <s> but it has worked out that at the peak time people need to be moved from paddington station <e> <s> that is on top of the number of people who are already moving in that area <e> <s> the normal traffic already has problems in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lady faithfull for allowing me to change places with her <e> <s> i must apologise to the house for the fact that i shall have to leave before the end of the debate because i have a long-standing engagement <e>", "<cs> my lords strength perhaps <e> <s> she is teaching people to stop and think <e> <s> the girl who was murdered on the train that came into victoria station was

policewoman explains to women dont pick the bad carriage <e> <s> just think a moment and go to the safer one <e> <s> dont walk down the badly lit nasty back alley go along the bright road with strong lights <e> <s> lighting is most important and gives people a great feeling of confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been asked to speak on this matter by the london boroughs association which is very concerned about some implications <e> <s> when i came to speak this morning i thought i should be per cent <e> <s> opposed to this order but having listened to noble lords opposite perhaps they have turned me into a devils advocate because i can see many flaws in the points they have made <e>", "<cs> my lords had i continued to the end of my comments i should have covered that <e> <s> the practicality of the situation is that it is not the family which will be disadvantaged but the local authority <e> <s> the noble lord gave the example of a family <e> <s> if that family became homeless it would become the responsibility of the local authority and would become a much greater and more expensive responsibility <e> <s> therefore i believe that the local authority will suffer because it will pay the additional subsidy <e> <s> that is the point that i think is unfair in this scheme <e> <s> i do not believe that people will be put out of what is almost suitable accommodation of the type described by the noble lord <e> <s> again i make the point that the size of the room should be looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> will he confirm however that these grounds will have a covenant attached to them to retain them in use as playing fields because it is a fact is it not that transfers must take place at the most profitable rates apart from when a free offer is involved <e> <s> if none of those free offers which the minister mentioned were taken up i understand the most profitable rate should be sought <e> <s> will covenants be attached to the grounds to ensure continuing sports use or will the minister rely on the new london strategic planning guidelines which would mean that at least an authority would have to advertise a change of use if that was what was proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister confirm that he appreciates that there is a very mixed position here between the department of education and science and the department of the environment and that there will be a need in planning terms for continuing liaison on this matter between those departments <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister inform me whether there is a possibility of greater flexibility in the use of immigration officers for incoming passengers <e> <s> i speak as one who only recently has become entitled to come through the united kingdom channel <e> <s> on saturday mornings in particular there is often two or three hours delay while waiting to pass through the all other passports channel because too many immigration officers are unoccupied at the uk channel <e> <s> is there a possibility of the government being able to use their influence to see that there is a more fair distribution of officers on duty <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for introducing the bill so clearly <e> <s> i must begin by declaring an interest because i am a member of the london electricity board <e> <s> i have served for nearly five years in that capacity <e> <s> however my financial interest will not be a long continuing one because i am sorry to have to say that when the board is privatised i shall no longer be part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt but i feel that i must take up this point <e> <s> those keys are not available only to people who are already in debt <e> <s> they are available whenever there is cause to change the meter <e> <s> whenever anyone requests a pre-payment meter it is a budget meter which is provided <e> <s> i must read to the noble baroness an extract from the <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend inform the house what the position is regarding infill sites in green belts that is small pockets within the green belt <e> <s> can he say whether such policy is decided by the local authority or whether the department has any specific ruling on the matter <e>", "<cs> i think that there is a degree of confusion in some of the statements which have been made <e> <s> on second reading i announced that i was a member of the london electricity board <e> <s> i do not therefore feel obliged to declare that interest again except just to put it on the record <e>", "<cs> as a number of questions have been asked of my noble friend perhaps i may ask another <e> <s> is it true that if such a statutory imposition were placed on the electricity industry it would be unique as there are no similar constraints on the gas industry or any other energy producer <e> <s> would it be just to impose such a constraint on one industry only <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the health service salaries referred to by the noble countess lady mar are severely limited and restricted and that much higher rates have to be paid to agency staff at all times because people cannot be found to fill jobs <e> <s> will this point be looked at carefully in the new administration <e>", "<cs> would it not be a problem to try to assess how reasonable something is in comparing one area board with another because conditions in different areas will be quite different <e> <s> i believe that even within an area there will be a difference between supplying houses within two blocks or houses spread over a large area <e> <s> therefore i do not accept that it should be possible to compare one area with another <e>", "<cs> i oppose this amendment <e> <s> i believe that the wording is interesting and i believe that the way in which the noble lord explained it makes it sound very sensible <e> <s> at present when one applies for a supply one is asked what appliances are to be used whether it is an electric cooker electric bar heaters or a system of total heating by electricity or whether there will be a gas supply <e> <s> therefore it is an approximation and the boards only wish to establish whether some sort of special supply is required instead of a normal domestic supply <e> <s> if so it would not be appropriate to supply that which is only suitable for domestic demand <e>", "<cs> in listening to the noble baroness lady phillips i think there is a slight misunderstanding <e> <s> supply goes into a domestic property at the same power <e> <s> whether or not you have enough power to run your kitchen appliances might depend on the wiring within the house but that is not relevant to the main supply which is connected <e> <s> the supply to your meter is the responsibility of the area board <e> <s> the supply after the meter and the wiring within the house is a matter for your own electrician <e> <s> of course the boards will check to see whether it has been done safely and whether the loading is correct <e>", "<cs> i believe that it will be better if i say something on this point as i seem to have raised all the problems in the first instance <e> <s> the position is that most domestic homes have a -kilowatt supply which covers practically everything in the home <e> <s> if you were the kind of person who was suddenly developing in your own basement some new high technology which you thought was going to take a fantastic additional supply surely you would go back <e>", "<cs> we would certainly wish to know about it if you were doing that <e> <s> it would be desirable for you to go back to the board and say i am intending to create a monster in my basement <e> <s> i do not know what powers the board would have to prevent you doing that <e> <s> we are here entering the realms of fantasy <e> <s> however without doubt the board would wish to know that you were proposing to do something quite exceptional in your house <e> <s> that would take you way outside the net of the ordinary domestic consumer <e> <s> for the ordinary domestic consumer pretty well everyone would be covered by the normal domestic supply <e> <s> however if you require an abnormal heavy load supply the area board or the supply company would need to know <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that there is much point in this although i do not believe that there is any harm in it <e> <s> we have always tended to take a view in committee that unless there is a point in putting in something then one does not want to complicate the legislation with words <e>", "<cs> i am rather concerned by this amendment <e> <s> the points made by my noble friend lord campbell of croy are very interesting and it may be that they are more relevant in scotland than in general <e> <s> i certainly cannot accept them as general policy <e>", "<cs> i do not think that one would get involved in costs for this work without being aware of the situation <e> <s> i think that one would certainly be given a price for connecting the supply well in advance <e> <s> one would have the choice of either accepting it or rejecting it <e>", "<cs> i find it a very interesting suggestion that there could be an annual charge <e> <s> it is something which probably a lot of the boards would like to look at <e> <s> so far as i know none is using it at present <e>", "<cs> this may seem to be an unusual clause in terms of what the noble lord lord williams referred to as his domestic well-being but it is enormously important to the electricity industry in these days when someone can set up a business which is run by computer in the middle of nowhere <e> <s> if for some reason the cable to that computer is cut and there is insufficient back-up a significant loss of information could result <e> <s> people with such computers could claim unlimited sums from any area board or supplier of electricity <e> <s> the provision is not included to cover instances where your toaster will not toast and you have to use the open fire it is intended to cover the implications of the use of modern technology where people work at distances remote from offices <e>", "<cs> when he looks into this matter will my noble friend consider whether it could be the case if this amendment were accepted that it would preclude say a group of people in domestic premises who wanted to use a combined heat and power arrangement for incineration of rubbish from making a special agreement with the electricity supplier <e> <s> it might well militate against the domestic consumer and perhaps he could look also at that aspect <e>", "<cs> i understand that a tariff customer is a person receiving a supply of electricity <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams was slightly off the track in saying that anyone in a place which has electricity could be responsible <e> <s> that is not so because it is the person who has signed the agreement with the supplying authority <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether people understand the way in which this system works now <e> <s> there is a code of practice but there is also a way that this is practised <e> <s> first there is an assessment as any meter has a certain limit of accuracy <e> <s> it is the policy of all boards to settle with customers wherever possible <e> <s> for example if a person claims to have been overcharged for electricity the meter is tested in its existing position <e> <s> if the meter is found to be faulty by that i do not mean that the person has tampered with it because as the committee will know there is a black museum full of the different ways of making meters work to favour the consumer rather than the board the area board will always settle with the customer <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to the noble baroness lady seear when she moved the amendment and to the noble lord lord dean of beswick when he supported it <e> <s> i have every sympathy with the idea that we do not want to see anyone disconnected from the electricity supply <e> <s> i understand the hardship involved <e> <s> i believe that they underestimate how many people play the game of brinkmanship <e> <s> the noble baroness said that she knows that some people try to avoid paying <e> <s> the threat of disconnection is a valuable weapon <e> <s> if the threat of disconnection were removed we would have many more problems <e> <s> there would be people who would never pay <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble baroness should appreciate that the prepayment meters or budget meters as they are now have a <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble baroness will allow me to intervene <e> <s> is she aware of the enormous debt owed to local authorities in london for housing <e> <s> the authorities have tried to recover those debts through the courts and it is a very expensive and ineffective method of doing so <e>", "<cs> i did not refer to electricity but to people in local authority housing <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak briefly on that one point about the number of days specified <e> <s> i think the points that have been made might be perfectly legitimate as regards the domestic customer but of course a tariff customer referred to under this section could be a large commercial customer and the amount involved could be very large <e> <s> indeed such customers are billed monthly <e>", "<cs> i must apologise for not being present for a moment as i had to get a photocopy done before the machine closed down <e> <s> i wish to comment briefly that i understood that there was already a condition in the licence which enabled the boards to discriminate in favour of assisting disabled people <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the statement that has just been made <e> <s> in our desire not to prolong debates on these amendments we have tended to allow the statements of the noble lord lord hatch to go unchallenged <e> <s> the feeling of this committee would not necessarily be in support of what he said on this issue in two respects <e> <s> first he stated the position as a fact when no fact has been proved as to the medical situation yet <e> <s> secondly he implied that solar and wave power and all these other issues could overnight provide sufficient energy for our needs <e> <s> i do not accept that <e> <s> it is good that this point has been brought up now <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak against amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> although i support the views put forward on energy efficiency i think that the amendment as set out is almost impossible to quantify <e> <s> it would place a tremendous burden on the supply company <e> <s> to quantify or even try to equate what demand reduction has actually produced through an energy efficiency programme and try to work that backwards into this formula it would be necessary to develop a considerable bureaucratic system <e> <s> this is becoming a mathematical and almost unworkable formula <e>", "<cs> if i may interrupt on that point i have spoken before about the supplier wanting to promote energy efficiency and i do not think it can be overlooked <e> <s> it is in the interests of the supplier to have satisfied customers and customers do not want to pay more and more for less satisfaction <e> <s> therefore each area board at the moment is running an economy system whereby they are encouraging conservation of energy <e> <s> of course they want to sell more appliances such as air conditioning and so on which may use more energy but they want more energy-efficient items <e> <s> they are also competing with the gas and oil industries <e> <s> it is not simply that they are competing with one another and satisfying the customer only <e> <s> there is an overall point that the customer will go where he gets the appliance that for example gives him the most heat for the least money <e> <s> therefore it is in the interests of the board to keep that consumer by providing energy efficient appliances <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the committee that i was called out of the chamber when the amendment was moved <e> <s> however i know <e>", "<cs> i oppose these amendments <e> <s> i consider them to be wrecking amendments <e> <s> if one supports privatisation of electricity as i do then there is no way that one could accept these amendments <e> <s> it is unfortunate however that there is such a mixture of members of the committee supporting the amendment <e> <s> i believe that their motives are entirely different <e>", "<cs> i must respond to that point <e> <s> my comments as regards motives were purely in a political context <e> <s> if they are found to be unpleasant surely that is the whole purpose of this committee stage <e> <s> we are here as a political committee <e> <s> if the reference is to the other day when i declared an interest in the bill and hoped that someone else had that is a different matter <e> <s> if we have a financial or commercial interest it is our responsibility to declare it to the committee <e> <s> it would be very wrong if the committee was not aware of it <e> <s> i consider the issue raised today to be highly political <e> <s> as i said i consider this to be a wrecking amendment <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble earl <e>", "<cs> having listened to this most interesting debate it seems to have been exclusively a scottish issue <e> <s> however as i read the words i am not so sure that it applies only to scotland <e> <s> perhaps the minister could tell us whether it involves any other bodies and whether it will apply to any areas other than scotland <e> <s> i shall be very interested to know what is the situation because i believe that we have considered this matter purely from a scottish point of view during the debate <e>", "<cs> the amendments to this clause are quite important <e> <s> that is why in spite of the wishes of members of the committee to go to dinner or move on to the next business we cannot afford not to discuss the amendments <e> <s> there are several points in the speech of my noble friend lord peyton that i did not quite understand <e> <s> one concerned who would follow the presently appointed board <e> <s> surely once something is privatised automatically it will be entirely within the power of the new privatised body to decide who follows afterwards <e> <s> the shareholders will have the right to decide that <e>", "<cs> even in respect of the present appointment all the distribution companies were very keen that david jefferies should be appointed <e> <s> i think that he emerged as the natural candidate <e> <s> as time progresses and when it is his turn to retire i believe that someone from the industry will emerge in the same way <e> <s> the appointment requires not only a very good business sense it also requires highly technical knowledge <e>", "<cs> i accept that <e> <s> i do not understand the noble lords jargon about merit order <e> <s> i am much more down to earth and appreciate that the weather is one of the biggest factors in determining electricity demand <e> <s> strangely enough it becomes much more expensive when there is heavy weather involving a very high demand <e> <s> under the present conditions that immediately pushes up the cost of electricity considerably <e> <s> if there is not enough usage it is uneconomic <e> <s> to have medium usage is best but if there is suddenly tremendously high demand it is necessary to bring in all those power stations which are uneconomic <e> <s> in order to supply the peak demand one incurs high costs <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether this point would be helpful to the committee or whether it has already been covered <e> <s> in nationalised industries accounts have always been prepared on a current costs accounting basis but accounts are being prepared on both historic cost and current cost bases so that there would be no problem with the transfer <e>", "<cs> listening to these comments from both sides i believe that noble lords are slightly at cross purposes <e> <s> subsection is quite clear <e> <s> subsection leads me to support the view taken by the noble lord lord williams that it does not say when a loan is to be repaid <e> <s> what the minister has said does not indicate that it cannot be repaid at a later date either <e> <s> why there should be a need to repay earlier i am not sure <e> <s> i am not sure why the noble lord lord williams believes a loan should be repaid earlier but i do not believe that there is any obligation under subsection to repay a loan at the moment when the company is wholly owned by the crown <e> <s> some debt may be allowed to continue and be repaid under subsection at such time and by such methods as the clause directs <e> <s> it seems to me to be fairly open as to how the loan shall be repaid <e> <s> the loan could be from the national loans fund during a time of eligibility but yet not necessarily repaid during the time of total ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness lady turner for initiating the debate and for introducing it so well <e> <s> i am always delighted to follow the noble earl lord longford because he is one of those brave men who always speak in a womens debate <e> <s> i am delighted that the noble earl lord russell has joined him because all the other back-bench speakers are women which is a shame <e> <s> apart from those summing up per cent <e> <s> of the speakers are men <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say that there has been a lot of publicity recently about a treasury creche which is now operating <e>", "<cs> i do not support the amendment and i am sure that that fact does not surprise any member of the committee <e> <s> i find the points which have been raised in the debate of great interest <e> <s> i thought that my noble friend lord trafford made a valid point <e> <s> it is in the public interest to obtain the best price for the sale of public assets <e> <s> i do not agree with what the noble lord lord ezra said <e> <s> he said that it is unfair to persuade people that shares are worth buying and thereby perhaps raise the price slightly <e> <s> we are talking about only slight differences here <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his explanation <e> <s> the other point is that it is extremely difficult to differentiate between advertising which is being done for the purposes of this industry and that for the gas industry <e> <s> from my own knowledge of the electricity industry i know that we must keep pretty well on form all the time <e> <s> there have been studies and surveys <e> <s> for example all one has to do is to give the gas shower a big boost on television and suddenly everyone will put in a gas-powered shower <e> <s> of course the electricity industry would be most distressed about the use of the word power as regards a gas shower because it feels that it is the source of power <e> <s> the electricity industry must then counter that and show what it can produce in the same way <e> <s> there is constant competition all the time between those two sources of power <e>", "<cs> i consider that advertising is important as i have already explained <e> <s> it is also a way of teaching people how to economise on the use of their power source whatever it may be <e> <s> however the point that i was about to make was that it is extremely difficult and would be extremely difficult under the terms of the amendment to differentiate between what is normal commercial advertising and what is advertising connected to the flotation <e> <s> that makes acceptance of the amendment most difficult <e>", "<cs> an important point has been raised here <e> <s> a point which has not been raised is that there may even be a question of confidentiality between one of the successor companies and another becuse of the great complexity of successor companies <e> <s> in order to consider the matter further we need a great deal more information than is presently available <e>", "<cs> i must declare a direct personal interest here as one of those very people <e> <s> therefore i intend to withdraw from the chamber during this part of the discussions <e> <s> i shall read about it in <e>", "<cs> i should like to be assured that the provision would ensure or at least permit that the proportion given back to the various bodies related to the amount that they had paid <e> <s> there is now a formula in accordance with which the different area boards make their contributions <e> <s> they then have a discussion as to whether those who have paid more will definitely be paid back more <e> <s> i do not wish to detain the committee today but i should like to know whether an assurance can be given on that matter <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask a question of those who have moved these amendments in particular my noble friend lady faithfull <e> <s> i understand how one differentiates precisely the teenagers who have come from local authority care <e> <s> but how in a case such as that described by the noble earl lord russell does one establish the cause of someone walking out of a yts scheme or going to a job and giving it up <e> <s> how can one establish the cause of that <e> <s> i can remember in the past circumstances where many patients in the section in which i was working on leaving school preferred not to take a job because it was so much nicer just to collect the money and go on living the life they lived when at school <e>", "<cs> there may be a little confusion here <e> <s> when my amendment was originally printed it included the words or part <e> <s> those words are not now included in my amendment <e> <s> i should make that clear to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i thank the members of the committee who have spoken on this matter <e> <s> i noticed that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran declared his connection with the war widows association <e> <s> i shall do the same <e> <s> i was the first honorary president and the noble baroness lady vickers is currently the president of that association <e> <s> i am sure that if she were well enough she would be here to speak on this point <e>", "<cs> i understood that precisely but the next example compared that with an authority which gave only a statutory disregard which distorted the equation <e> <s> the problem lies in the difference between the disregards given in different areas <e> <s> the disregard is not in any case at all related to the circumstances of the people concerned although i am given to understand by the british legion that there are one or two of the much smaller number of local authorities which have a particular scheme that takes need into account <e> <s> but that is very rare <e> <s> on the whole a policy decision is made that every eligible person living in the local authority area will have either a total disregard a per cent <e> <s> disregard or just the disregard <e> <s> on the whole there is a blanket disregard for the local authority in question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that no one will be surprised to hear that i am opposed to the amendment <e> <s> although those who have put the case for the amendment have done so <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am sorry i think that that is quite wrong <e> <s> i think that there will be secondary and tertiary generators who will be able to supply and that anyone will be able to offer a supply <e> <s> that is what will happen and that is why the five-year protection may be relevant now <e> <s> following that period there will be nothing at all to stop the entry into this field of other people <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the concern of the electricity authorities that they will be painted into a corner <e> <s> they do not foresee it <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the noble lord is trying to turn my argument on its head <e> <s> as i explained previously and i shall repeat it the electricity authorities are perfectly happy to supply urban and rural areas at the same price <e> <s> if a competitor comes in to undercut them to take away all their business in the urban area leaving them with only the rural area it could create an adverse effect for the area board on the overall costing of the supply <e> <s> where the same charge has been guaranteed for everyone the only people left to be supplied would be the rural customers <e> <s> they would be paying higher prices with no discrimination against them because they would be the only people being supplied <e> <s> it would all be supplied at the same price but much more expensively than if they had been able to retain a competitive base and supply some of the profitable areas as well as the less profitable ones <e> <s> i can see that the noble lord has a further comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall quote figures which have no relevance <e> <s> if you are paying p per unit and you get a leaflet through your door to the effect that you can have all your power at p or p a unit would you not think twice about it <e> <s> i certainly would <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a new argument <e> <s> we have seen this cherry picking in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in favour of this amendment because i believe the whole idea of privatising the electricity industry is to take it away from political control and make it responsible for its own affairs but with an adequate degree of protection <e> <s> i do not consider this amendment achieves that purpose <e> <s> all it does is immediately to bring the secretary of state and the political element of control back in <e> <s> i do not think this provision offers any advantage to the consumer world <e> <s> i consider it would be a disadvantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i find this a slightly strange clause although i do not particularly support either amendment <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is slightly ambiguous <e> <s> i had taken the phrase interests in the area to mean that the people concerned possibly had some financial interest geographically in the area <e> <s> i consider the wording not satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his comments <e> <s> the clause is probably just an attempt to explain what is meant but it states <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot resist rising to that challenge <e> <s> however i have been asked on other bodies to bring up the point that many women are disadvantaged by phraseology such as has been employed here <e> <s> loss of remuneration provides only for a person in paid employment <e> <s> if a woman has small children or an elderly relative to be cared for and she has to pay someone to look after the child or relative that is covered only by a phrase that is used in the magistrates courts claim other expenses necessarily incurred <e> <s> i could not accept the amendment without such a phrase as other expenses necessarily incurred which covers women in those circumstances <e> <s> it is either both or neither phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down as i understand it the phrase out-of-pocket expenses might well cover the point that i have made <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may seek clarification <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord mentioned amendment no <e> <s> when he spoke of the amendment of the noble lord lord ezra <e>", "<cs> my lords the industry as noble lords may already know has already agreed to standards of service and penalty payments for domestic premises <e> <s> however i think the industry feels that commercial customers should be able to pursue their own remedies without such assistance where the industry has been negligent <e> <s> on the whole this amendment is one that i cannot support <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose this amendment because as no doubt the noble baroness heard me say at a previous stage of the bills proceedings in the london board area there are cases a year of people threatened with disconnection <e> <s> that is because they do not wish to <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down will she clarify whose option she is talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the amendment perhaps misunderstands the situation <e> <s> the purpose of calibrating the meter it is always done in a sensible way is to enable the person gradually to pay off the amount owing <e> <s> the boards take a sympathetic view if an effort is made to make up the arrears <e> <s> it is a way of preventing disconnection <e> <s> the alternative would be that the person would have to be disconnected from the supply <e> <s> i believe that it is an advantage not a disadvantage to the customer to have the opportunity to calibrate in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the point about rates very strange <e> <s> i know that the electricity industry has always been unhappy with the present rating system <e> <s> however under the new rating system there will continue to be a right of appeal <e> <s> if one is discriminated against one therefore has a right of appeal <e> <s> i do not understand the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the parallel between the water bill and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am slightly puzzled by this amendment i would have thought that all the accounts of any company would be in accordance with what is required by the inland revenue and that depreciation for example would be allowed only on a certain basis <e> <s> i do not understand that point <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness has missed the point that we are speaking of people who are blind deaf or unable to walk <e> <s> i do not believe that all three disabilities have to apply to the same person <e> <s> however i agree with the noble baroness that it would be an impossible situation otherwise in terms of numbers <e> <s> i shall not vote for this amendment <e> <s> that is not because i do not have sympathy with the cause <e> <s> i believe it has been magnificently presented by the noble lord lord carter and also in typically moderate tone by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> i shall not vote for the amendment because as i have listened to the debate it has become quite clear that no one really knows the situation <e> <s> the review that is currently being conducted will give the answers in a positive way as regards the number of people involved <e>", "<cs> my lords as we are all aware the bed and breakfast system is unsatisfactory <e> <s> bayswater is full of people from other boroughs all over london who are in bed and breakfast accommodation although it is westminster accommodation <e> <s> i have spoken previously about how children from lambeth have to go there every day for various services although they live in westminster <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply which delights me <e> <s> however i am still slightly puzzled <e> <s> he said that the amount is not embodied in an act but in regulations <e> <s> it seems to me to be embodied in the act <e> <s> my amendment sought to amend the act <e> <s> perhaps he can explain that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> i had not realised that the was not specified in the previous act <e> <s> i knew that the words statutory disregard were used <e> <s> i do not have that section of the act with me <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> my lords at committee stage the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale said that he welcomed the provision in the criminal justice bill which was more or less a parallel of this clause <e> <s> he said that it gave effect i see that the noble lord wishes to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords as i read <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i would like to be put right on this matter by the minister when he replies <e> <s> i thought there was quite a difference <e> <s> i understood that under the governments proposals the recoupment would <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> does he agree that the transfer of responsibility to the national health service hospitals and authorities will not in any way prevent or even reduce claims for negligence and that probably a considerable degree of expertise will be needed in this field <e> <s> are the government considering a contracted-out basis which would enable the existing expertise to be used or are they considering that it should be done in-house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the degree of confusion that the indeterminate date of commencement is causing to practitioners most of whom renew at this time of the year their subscriptions to the societies which act for them <e> <s> the renewal time at which most people start to pay their annual subscription appears to be related to the date of qualification <e> <s> we have read in the press of the reduction that will take place <e> <s> it is very difficult for both the practitioner and for the body concerned to work out what the cost of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be a second voice against the amendment <e> <s> i do not think it is necessary and there may be much more in the wording than at first sight appears <e> <s> i would go along with the statement of the noble viscount lord hanworth that there should be encouragement of chp <e> <s> i undertand that but as i read the amendment it does not simply suggest encouragement it suggests positive financial decisions and obliges people to carry out such activities whether or not they are satisfactory <e> <s> for that reason i do not like the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i am slightly lost in the technicalities of the matter <e> <s> however perhaps it was the case that the noble lord should have asked the leave of the house before he spoke <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the case that if this body decided to hold its meeting in public it could do so while retaining a private part of the agenda <e> <s> however under this amendment the private part of the agenda could not be private <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that this amendment has come forward again <e> <s> on behalf of the boards i wish to say that they consider it important though they are quite willing to undertake anything of this nature that the role of a general social services department of a local authority should not be overlooked <e> <s> it might be that in conjunction with the kind of work set out here that there is need for greater adaptation of properties which would not be those with the social services <e> <s> it would be important to have liaison with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to congratulate my noble friends on the front bench and the noble baroness lady hooper in particular for the way in which she has guided the bill <e> <s> it has been an extremely complex and difficult bill and the grasp that she has of the electricity industry during the time in which she has been with the department of energy is quite remarkable <e> <s> i congratulate her <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> have any discussions taken place with the director of the museum about the museums future <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to having told us what is in the museum can my noble friend tell us about the very wide educational activities of this museum <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in other countries particularly in scandinavia university accommodation is available during the summer months for holiday purposes for visiting tourists <e> <s> does the minister know whether any of our universities use their facilities in that way <e> <s> a provision allowing such accommodation to be available could benefit people on lower incomes who are visiting this country could it not <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to oppose the motion <e> <s> it was most interesting to hear it so beautifully introduced by the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> however i remain totally unconvinced that there is any justice in the proposal to adjourn this debate for further consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in that remark of the noble lord <e> <s> i believe that he is overlooking the fact that the industry has been one whole huge industry <e> <s> it has not been sectionalised in the way that he suggests so that people would have known the exact costs <e> <s> i do not think that the costs have clearly been known until this stage <e> <s> however as indicated already this would not affect the bill <e> <s> no change is required in the bill <e> <s> that is a highly relevant point <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not comment on that point i do not know who produced the figures whether they came from the department or the industry <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams referred to the management problem and commented upon how complicated a structure <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene as he has mentioned my name <e> <s> why does he believe that the present high safety standards will not be maintained and that the government and the department of energy will not ensure that they are maintained whoever are the owners of the magnox stations <e>", "<cs> i do not support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> however i find this concept of the capital values a very strange basis on which to determine the rents <e> <s> it will be extremely complicated to assess the capital value of a block <e> <s> will it be based on historic value upgraded <e> <s> is the condition of the repair of blocks to be taken into account <e> <s> there are blocks of flats quite close to us here where if the whole block is to be sold to the sitting <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether it is just a european body that discusses these matters or whether there exists an international body <e> <s> moreover is it taken into account that some letters for example those from australia appear to come much more quickly than those sent in the reverse direction because of the change in the different time zones across the world <e>", "<cs> my lords during the debate on the amendment related to this question we were told that there would be a report and firm figures published very soon <e> <s> can my noble friend tell us whether there is any news of the immediate publication of those exact figures <e>", "<cs> i understood the change in terms of bringing the period of time into line with that in respect of the industrial tribunal procedure <e> <s> under that procedure you cannot bring a case until you have been in employment for two years <e> <s> any written statement about why you were dismissed prior to that may be of benefit to you <e> <s> however it causes a great deal of work and has no effect on the tribunal because you are not eligible to bring a case if you have been in employment for only nine months <e>", "<cs> we have drifted around on this subject <e> <s> my noble friend lord mountgarret has perhaps tended to confuse the issue of the written warning that has to be given up to the two-year period <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment addresses itself purely to this after you are dismissed and you can be dismissed at any time up to two years without prior notice it is then a question of when you are entitled to receive a written reason as to why you are dismissed <e>", "<cs> i wish to see the bill remain as it stands <e> <s> my experience in industrial tribunals shows that at a pre-hearing assessment the person involved is warned that if he loses the case costs will be awarded against him <e> <s> when costs are implemented after the case has been fully heard he then explains that he is living on unemployment benefit and can pay nothing <e> <s> it means that in the end the costs do not exist because in many cases it is impossible to collect the money <e>", "<cs> the case i am making is that at the moment this appears to be the only type of power capable of dealing with such cases <e> <s> i have asked a number of members of the committee who i thought would know the answer <e> <s> they have told me that they believe there to be no parallel between the tribunal and the court of law <e> <s> i should be interested to hear whether anyone in the committee knows whether there is such a parallel <e>", "<cs> my lords although it would clearly prevent any effect on reducing inflation if the building societies were too helpful to people with mortgages because the increase in interest rates definitely has an impact on inflation does the minister agree that most building societies make every effort to help anyone in real difficulty <e> <s> does he think that the public are sufficiently aware of the fact if they are in difficulties they should approach their building society <e>", "<cs> my lords i am concerned about the amendment <e> <s> when i first saw it i wondered whether it was an attempt to limit grey power and if so what a shame that would be because i am all in favour of using older people <e> <s> i read the amendment again carefully and considered again a case that i recently heard <e> <s> i felt that there were great dangers in the amendment <e> <s> the greatest danger is the point that i brought out previously namely that of the vexatious litigant <e> <s> it may be decided not to employ someone because he is old <e> <s> that person may be looking for an occupation in life <e> <s> in such a case that person may do what i described as regards the earlier case <e> <s> each time he applies for a job and is not interviewed or chosen he can immediately bring a case to the industrial tribunal stating that he was unreasonably discriminated against on the grounds of age <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a certain sympathy not with the wording of the amendment which looks rather unworkable but with the principle behind it <e> <s> it is serious that people can now lose their social security benefit for six months <e> <s> in the past if at the end of that period ones case was justified one received the benefit retrospectively <e> <s> i understand that one does not receive it at all now <e> <s> that can create hardship <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not allow this matter to pass without speaking as i raised the issue of vexatious litigants at committee stage <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord wedderburn that cases are rare <e> <s> certainly in the years during which i have sat on these tribunals i only found one applicant who had brought to cases <e> <s> however the noble lord lord meston mentioned during our last discussion that he also had come across a number of cases mostly under the race relations act <e> <s> people had brought such cases at a very early stage when they were simply job applications <e> <s> they were not even cases in which they had been interviewed for the jobs concerned <e> <s> it involved a great waste of public time and money <e> <s> indeed one of the tribunal decisions in a previous hearing of the case to which i referred said that cases of this type did much to discredit the discrimination legislation by abusing the system <e> <s> so the vexatious litigant is one category but there are others <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> i know that she is aware that i retire just before the new contract comes into force so this is not personal pleading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister will be able to confirm the fact that per cent <e> <s> of the charge is now paid by patients <e> <s> will she confirm that she is aware that a practice which is not considered desirable of selective treatment is now carried out in high-cost areas whereby dentists carry out only profitable forms of treatment on the health service <e> <s> will she also confirm that under the new contract the selective system which has been used by dentists to survive in those high-cost areas will no longer be available and that patients will have to have either fully national health treatment or fully private treatment or will she tell us whether the government are considering salaried community dentists for example particularly in deprived areas <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that her last statement will put back the whole situation <e> <s> we know as she said that patients will have the right to continue with private treatment but we also know that dentists will not have a right to refuse any one treatment whatever it may be <e> <s> therefore my fear is that they may refuse all treatment <e> <s> that is my point <e> <s> is the minister aware of that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the ministers reply he is saying that this would be treated as a taxable benefit and that one would pay tax only on the value of the money <e> <s> however will he confirm that if the other tenants referred to in the question are not employees the government intend to leave any arrangements for a landlord to charge a comprehensive rent including rates for decision between landlords and tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that women paying tax on child care benefit would feel aggrieved if any special concession were made in the cases mentioned here yet were not extended to child care <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether his first answer was based upon the number of people in posts or upon the establishment of the councils <e> <s> is he aware that many local authorities are now having great difficulty in recruiting officers <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord hunter of newington for introducing this debate and for giving us this opportunity to speak <e> <s> this is a time for change in the health service and it is a good thing to have change because the service has gone on for such a long time and has been tinkered with again and again <e> <s> i think it was in that the noble lord lord joseph carried out a reorganisation and brought in the present structure of area health authorities regions and districts which now have become districts only and the hospitals which have survived best since are the ones which retained boards of governors on the postgraduate teaching hospitals <e> <s> they are now redesignated as special health authorities <e>", "<cs> i find amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble lord lord ezra slightly dangerous when it refers to any substance which taken into the body <e> <s> although under subsection <e>", "<cs> that has been dealt with <e>", "<cs> does my noble friend also include facilities such as meals on wheels in that category or does it relate only to distribution from the ec <e> <s> i know that it is a grey area <e>", "<cs> with respect meals on wheels can be paid or unpaid <e>", "<cs> i think it very important that a genuine medical allergy should in no way be classified as a food problem <e> <s> it is specific to a particular individual <e> <s> it is a reaction of his or her auto-immune system to a particular protein <e> <s> some people have such a reaction with shellfish strawberries and various other foods <e> <s> the same strawberries or shellfish could be eaten by any one of us without having any effect <e> <s> however such a degree of allergy might be reached that one could be approaching the anaphylactic shock point and that persons life could be at risk by eating that food <e>", "<cs> i am reassured to a certain extent by what my noble friend said <e> <s> however i do not feel that this clause covers a situation which can and does exist from time to time <e> <s> i was chairman of the health committee in this immediate area <e> <s> one of the food inspectors attempted to take food which he thought was definitely unfit for sale whereupon the person selling it seized it and flushed it down the toilet <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> i propose to return with the amendment deleting the days and inserting instead a reasonable time at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for those remarks <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i put this down as a probing amendment <e> <s> we have had a very good discussion <e> <s> perhaps further thought can be given to the matter before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i oppose the motion on the grounds that there is no provision for the clause to deal with the person who deliberately obstructs and prevents a local authority food officer from obtaining the samples necessary for testing <e> <s> the case i quoted earlier is not an isolated one <e> <s> during my term of office as chairman of the local health committee there were many cases of devious vendors rather than suppliers or preparers of food who developed the most incredibly clever and devious ways of preventing the local health officer from taking the necessary samples <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to hear that obstruction is an offence under clause <e> <s> nevertheless i do not know whether that power is sufficient to enable the officers to carry out their duties <e> <s> will my noble friend give careful thought to the matter between this and the bills next stage <e> <s> i too should like to give thought to it to see whether an amendment to clause should be tabled <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord for his contribution <e> <s> he makes the point that the bill deals with recklessly furnishing false information or misleading material but it does not deal with concealing information or preventing people from obtaining that information <e> <s> perhaps we should consider the matter again in relation to clause or at the next stage of the bill when we deal with clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend for that remark it demonstrates what a lot of common sense she and the government have <e> <s> i shall be pleased to consult as regards the wording <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am greatly reassured by what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i am sure that the industry will also be grateful <e> <s> the point was raised very strongly at the all-party meeting we had outside the chamber <e> <s> it is very good that the minister intends to review the clause <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it may well be that my noble friend lord lucas meant that if the loss of food was in any way the fault of the proprietor then that would be a different matter and the insurance policy may then be void <e> <s> however we have had a most useful discussion on the matter and in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that colour is quite important in food <e> <s> those of us who are well fed and like our food do not always appreciate the fact that there are people who have to be tempted to eat for example the elderly the frail and the anorexic <e> <s> indeed many people will not eat unless food looks appealing <e> <s> such people are really not eating enough <e> <s> therefore i think that colour plays an important part in the process <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the amendment as proposed might be more effective in cases such as that of the skoal bandit <e> <s> some people classified that as a food and others classified it as a drug <e> <s> it was a terrible tobacco product which one chewed <e> <s> it was very carcinogenic and many oral cancers developed as a result of it <e> <s> my point is that by the time that that was discovered the skoal bandit was being manufactured in this country <e> <s> a large government grant had been obtained to set up a factory to produce it <e> <s> when the product was banned it was argued that we were taking employment away from the region in which the factory was set up and the region needed employment <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak from the local authority point of view and support this amendment at least in principle <e> <s> as the clause is set out it could form almost a mini-planning control and it could involve for the local authority a great deal of work and trouble unrelated to food <e> <s> for example a change of use from a different type of <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the principle of the amendment <e> <s> i think that this is a point which i raised at an earlier stage of the bill <e> <s> it is very wrong that an obstruction should carry any less penalty than if someone had committed the offence <e> <s> i have quoted examples and it is well known that people obstruct <e> <s> there is a parallel with drunken driving where if a person refuses to give a breath test or blood test that person is treated as having committed the offence and the penalty is the same <e> <s> i think that this should be parallel <e> <s> whether the wording is right i do not know but it is an important issue <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that reply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that reply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak briefly on clause in order to point out to the minister that the clause has definitions of various terms <e> <s> will she consider before we come to the next stage of the bill whether or not there should be a definition of the word labelling <e> <s> i know that she said that it would not be necessary because the definition was in the food labelling regulations of <e> <s> however would it not be better to define what labelling means in the bill rather than leave it to subordinate legislation <e> <s> there are some other minor definitions such as that of advertisement <e> <s> i leave it to the minister to consider that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i would happily have spoken after the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i oppose these amendments <e> <s> i hope that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor will not accept them <e> <s> i intend to speak later on clause stand part and i shall go into greater detail then <e>", "<cs> these are problems with this clause as drafted <e> <s> i consider that it is based on an incorrect supposition which is that the mortgage-lending institutions have it within their power to force borrowers to use related services such as estate agency conveyancing surveying insurance broking house removals etc <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be possible in the case of parking meters or alternatively residents car parking spaces to ensure that following the clamping the car is removed <e> <s> i have very often seen as many as eight clamped cars in one street half of them occupying residents parking spaces <e> <s> in those cases could the cars be removed after clamping <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment leaves me in a slight difficulty in that i am aware that local authorities have great difficulty in obtaining what i describe as suitably qualified people <e> <s> there are just not enough fully qualified environmental health inspectors and public health officers <e> <s> whether or not this could be covered by making the suitable qualification referred to at varying levels i do not know <e> <s> there may be a need on occasions to be able to delegate the authority to other people and for that reason i have slight doubts about the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord <e> <s> as we are discussing these amendments together presumably now is the moment to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> when i first saw the amendment i could not understand the exact reason for it <e> <s> i thought it was onerous <e> <s> but now that i have looked thoroughly into the matter i find that it is exactly the reverse <e> <s> i thought that per cent <e> <s> of the population being allergic to a food would be a fairly common occurrence <e> <s> however research by the european commission scientific committee for food showed that per cent <e> <s> of people are sensitive to something <e> <s> that per cent <e> <s> includes those sensitive to housedust and pollens <e> <s> only per cent <e> <s> are sensitive to some form of foodstuff and only per cent <e> <s> to food additives <e> <s> the percentage of people allergic to a food at per cent <e> <s> of the population is very small <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for her explanation which i shall read with care <e> <s> however it seems inconsistent that if the case that i mentioned had involved a perishable product which had depreciated in value it would have been possible to make a claim even if the amount of money was the same yet because a replacement had to be provided it was not possible to do so <e> <s> that was the case that i made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the government have brought forward the amendment because this is an extremely complex matter which it is difficult to get right <e> <s> as i said in committee i have seen cases where thoroughly disreputable and unreliable people were managing or running food businesses <e> <s> when they <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> it does not seem right to me that one group should be entitled to compensation and not another <e> <s> i shall not comment on the wording of the clause because i have not studied it in detail <e> <s> but it seems only fair that something along the lines of clause should be provided for other people <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asked to move amendment no <e> <s> standing in my name <e> <s> however i am now speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i was asked to move the amendment by the john lewis waitrose group because it was surprised to note the terms in which the clause was drafted <e> <s> it effectively repeats provisions which were formerly contained in section of the food act with one significant drafting difference <e> <s> that is that the former section which was drafted by the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in favour of proceeding with irradiated food <e> <s> it will not only be beneficial as a means of preserving food in this country but when it has been tried tested and used here regularly it will eventually be of enormous benefit to people in the third world where so much grain deteriorates due to fungal infection <e> <s> the grain could be preserved and eaten by people who would otherwise be starving <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the reply and i am pleased she has confirmed that the high standards will be maintained <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank those members who have taken part in the debate on this third reading <e> <s> however i feel that every speech we have heard has made it more apparent that there is now no control whatever over minicabs and that some control is necessary <e> <s> as i listened to people putting one case i felt that they made exactly the opposite case <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that clarification and in the interim in this year they have presented their case to the committee on the bill <e> <s> this is what i cannot understand if these people had so many points why were they not presented to the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords this is exactly my point about minicabs <e> <s> we are not suggesting that they should have the right to ply for hire or look or act like black cabs <e> <s> they would be an ancillary service in the way that dental hygienists are <e>", "<cs> my lords so on those clauses i cannot claim responsibility in any way on behalf of the promoters for withdrawing them <e> <s> it looks as though they were disallowed and rejected out of hand <e> <s> but i appreciate the point made that others were withdrawn <e> <s> the difficulty with this kind of bill is that it represents a group of london boroughs each of which has its own specific problem and it has been put together under the auspices of just one promoting authority acting on behalf of all the other london boroughs <e> <s> i will pass his message on <e> <s> i think it is important not to waste the time of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said that these stamps were only issued on a temporary basis <e> <s> can he confirm that there will be no time-limit on the usage of these stamps <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> they are not paying it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank those who have participated in this very interesting debate <e> <s> i feel i must respond to a few of the points that have been made <e> <s> i am delighted that the noble lord lord ezra has given general support to the proposal and i shall say no more about that <e> <s> however i must respond to my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords it was of course very moving to listen to the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> she certainly speaks from knowledge <e> <s> one comment she made struck me forcefully <e> <s> she referred to the turmoil of insecurity <e> <s> that is the worrying aspect at the present time and why i welcome the bill and believe that it must be implemented as a whole the sooner the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for those comments <e> <s> i still hold the same view that it is now an accepted practice to pay people for whatever time they give up <e> <s> any question of payment within the health service for committee members would be fairly minimal as it is in local authorities <e> <s> people would be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses <e> <s> these are not full-time competitive jobs which people would be aiming to get <e> <s> the dedication would still be there <e> <s> but it is wrong that we should rule out people who cannot afford to give their time for nothing <e> <s> we should not rule them out by saying that we shall not pay the committee members <e> <s> it should be open to anyone to serve on those committees <e> <s> they should not be prevented from doing so on financial grounds <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord lord dainton tell us whether he has it in mind that it will automatically be the dean of the institute who <e>", "<cs> i oppose this amendment mainly because despite the very big names of the royal colleges which are behind it i have great respect for their views i believe that it is not right because the measures proposed are impractical <e> <s> to start one or several pilot schemes is simply a method of delaying the whole matter <e> <s> it would be unfair in terms of pressure on the people <e>", "<cs> the point made by the noble lord lord ennals is inappropriate <e> <s> i do not believe that most people want a great deal of detailed information about the activities of the fpc or its successor <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady robson said people want to know where they can find information <e> <s> if a person has a complaint or needs a doctor that is when information is required <e> <s> it would involve a great deal of money to publish information about the activities of these authorities which would be of very little interest to patients <e> <s> the situation is parallel to that of the gas consumers council and the electricity consumers council <e> <s> there should be places where notices are available but the provisions need not necessarily go so far as having offices in high streets <e> <s> in some areas it would involve so much money to have premises in high streets where people could drop in for information <e> <s> in others it might be quite practical <e> <s> if such <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord underhill for giving us this subject for debate to which there have been some outstanding contributions <e> <s> it is clear that we all believe that it is most important that a decision should be made and made quickly about the route into london so that the matter can be progressed <e> <s> it is dragging on and uncertainty is the biggest problem of all <e> <s> that is a point which has come through from every member of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is not on the list of speakers because i thought that i would still be in australia and i have only just returned <e> <s> knowing that the bill was coming forward for second reading i thought that it would be wrong if i did not add my voice to the debate because it is a significant matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord willis referred to australia and i thank him for his nice remarks <e> <s> the noble lord is almost an honorary australian <e> <s> i wish that i could spend as much time in australia as he does <e> <s> he makes regular trips <e> <s> i am sure he will know what i mean when i say that the one advantage parkes feels that it has over forbes is having a baroness <e> <s> there is much rivalry between those two small country towns <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak to the amendment because i believe that there is a very real problem at the moment particularly as regards the matters referred to in the first part of the amendment <e> <s> i do not feel at all the same way about the second part of the amendment which deals with appeals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to disagree with those who have ably supported the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord peston said the amendment is not at all political <e> <s> i agree with him on that but i think the matter is one of common sense <e> <s> all of us would like to have an open cheque and i believe that is what is being asked for <e> <s> the noble lord lord walton explained that if a particular drug was given to a patient it could use up the entire budget of a gp <e> <s> that seems to me to contradict the argument that gps should have open-ended budgets so they can spend the vast amount of money that is required for that particular drug <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall reply to that point <e> <s> i believe that all of us would like to have no cash limits on anything <e> <s> however whether it is a case of my housekeeping budget or the national economy that is not the way the world operates <e> <s> sooner or later we all have to think of how we spend our money <e> <s> i am no economist <e> <s> i do not talk about cash limits but of what can be afforded <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly pleased to see the amendments <e> <s> can the minister confirm that we can be reassured that housing association grant will now be available for providing such homes <e> <s> there was some concern that if a mentally handicapped person for example was not technically paying rent but was instead being sponsored by the social services which were paying the costs entirely on his or her behalf the fact that no rent was visible would mean that no housing asociation grant could be made available for the construction of the property <e> <s> housing associations which are either currently involved or have in the pipeline well-advanced plans to provide accommodation for the categories which are so desperately in need of it were very worried that the bill might have prevented them from providing such accommodation and obtaining the necessary grant to do so <e> <s> as i understand it the amendments will mean that housing association grant will remain available <e> <s> subject to confirmation of that point i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that intervention is out of order <e>", "<cs> my lords i too oppose this amendment <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is nothing but a tag to bring us to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> that is where the real essence of the argument lies <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is specifically designed to delay implementation <e> <s> my noble friend lord carr put very well the case for the patients <e> <s> what is important is that if you are proceeding with <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that many people are not ready <e> <s> but they have given great thought to what is to happen <e> <s> they have made tentative plans and are waiting for the go-ahead <e> <s> we had assurances at earlier stages <e> <s> i was not present for the report stage but i was here in committee when we were told that matters would progress slowly and that after the implementation date there would not be one mad rush to change everything overnight <e> <s> i accepted that statement <e> <s> i believe that that is the wise way to approach the matter and i believe that the amendment is nothing but a wrecking amendment <e> <s> i oppose it <e>", "<cs> my lords although we have covered the ground before i wish to repeat that i am in favour of the right for changes in staff terms <e> <s> the board on which i served for many years and which is now a special health authority found that in london it was almost impossible to obtain and maintain good nurses because it was unable to compete in the open market <e> <s> it was unable to design its employees conditions in a way that would have been to the employees advantage as well as to that of the hospital <e> <s> one of the good aspects of the bill is that there will be an opportunity to look at the staff situation differently and to reassess it <e> <s> one can decide where the need lies and where there should be more pay <e> <s> one can also decide where the need does not exist and where people are being paid to do something which is of no benefit to patients or to anyone else <e> <s> the provisions in the amendment would be restrictive and i hope that the government will not accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to this debate and i am slightly puzzled by it <e> <s> are we talking about voluntary organisations that are funded through local authority voluntary grants such as the london boroughs grants body that determine where they will give their money <e> <s> if that is so i think that they would very much resent the fact that their right to decide where the money should go would be taken away from them <e> <s> or are we talking about different types of organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have liked to speak at length on this amendment <e> <s> however as the noble lord has given what was almost a second reading speech which lasted minutes there is not time to do so <e> <s> i do not agree with him at all <e> <s> he has overlooked the point that by paying people on national scales employees become hard to find in areas of great need <e> <s> there is a strong case to be made for freedom of bargaining by which a better service would be delivered to patients because it would be possible to pay incentives in order to attract people to those areas in which they are really needed <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that there is now special provision for the kind of case which has been referred to and that the industrial tribunals provide an <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is now a closer working relationship between local and health authorities which is beneficial although tragic cases still occur <e> <s> can she say what policy the government have to co-ordinate child care <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what facilities there are for training social workers and whether there is any opportunity for older people to train on a part-time basis <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who sits as a member of an industrial tribunal can the minister reconcile the fact that we have been told that we can now sit only half as frequently when there are so many more cases
