has said is that good practice is established already <e> <s> to spell it out in the bill in the way suggested we believe would be harmful in the long run <e> <s> undoubtedly regulations which have

amended by the bill will be exactly the same that is the benefit will be paid providing the man attends the course <e> <s> what the revised legislation will do is to clarify the right of appeal which

corporations present pension arrangements <e> <s> it may be helpful to the committee if i very briefly describe those arrangements <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to the arguments of the

my lords i think the house should be aware that under our standing orders the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is not permitted to seek the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords as part of the agricultural prices package it was agreed that the reduction of levies on imports of feed grains by sea which are granted to italy under regulation / would be phased out in three equal steps by st july <e> <s> in recognition of the special problems in northern ireland the council agreed to consider at an early meeting proposals which have been made by the commission and which would benefit agriculture in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the government are aware of all the problems which my noble friend has stated <e> <s> i think it would be more informative if i said to my noble friend that mr gundelach was not able to come up with a scheme at the agricultural council on th to th may but he presented orally proposals for specific aids to northern ireland to assist the

justification in seeking for standing orders to be read aloud <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord lord lever of manchester whose very agreeable remarks the house will appreciate would feel disposed to withdraw his motion <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make a personal statement <e> <s> yesterday i had occasion to move that standing order no <e> <s>

<e> <s> i cannot possibly claim to give him satisfaction in this regard but the history of this matter is an extremely long one <e> <s> i begin by saying that the noble lord lord wells-pestell referred to clause of the bill in his speech on second reading at column on nd june <e> <s> i remind your lordships of his remarks <e>", "<cs> i am attempting to explain and i thought i was embarking on a very useful explanation of how we have reached this point <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will listen and will contain himself <e> <s> i have further to come on to the right honourable members next speech on this subject on review a matter of eight years later <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will allow me to do so and that i may be permitted to continue <e>", "<cs> if i am allowed to continue in this vein we reach a very important debate on th december when the conservative party were in government <e> <s> a review had been taking place and the phillips committee had reported <e> <s> the same right honourable member mr james griffiths from llanelli at column said this <e>", "<cs> it may well be that the noble lord lord wells-pestell feels that the government are being immoral <e> <s> but i have attempted to show that that is not the case <e> <s> i would further point out the remarks of his noble friend lady wootton of abinger which related to the extreme complication of the situation as it is <e> <s> what better way to relieve the noble baroness of her anxieties and indeed the anxieties of a very large number of people in computing this scheme than to ensure its abolition at the cut-off date of june the date to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> i fully recognise the concern that has been expressed about this problem by both the noble lord lord wells-pestell and by my noble friend lady macleod <e> <s> i think there is a considerable case for special pleading in this regard but i am unhappy to say that it will be difficult for me to add very much to what has already been said in another place <e>", "<cs> i think i said on the amendment we dealt with just before the statements that the cut-off point is june <e> <s> i think the cut-off final date for ers is june <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to the arguments of the noble lord lord wells-pestell <e> <s> i think i can say that we on this side of the committee always listen to his arguments with the closest care and indeed read them afterwards <e> <s> but the problem is that it is impossible for the government indeed for any government to say that the situation as regards national insurance is frozen in time <e> <s> in the past much has had to be superseded by changes in benefit and this bill makes further changes <e>", "<cs> i think much of the last two speeches of the noble lord lord davies of leek and the noble lord lord ross of marnock was replied to very well by the noble baroness lady wootton of abinger <e> <s> t expect the noble lord lord ross will remember what the noble baroness said <e> <s> she referred to the extreme complication of the whole of the social security budget <e> <s> there comes a time when a great complication and great rigidity is built into a succession of statutes <e> <s> i need not recite them all but starting with the act in current legislation i will not go back further one statute has built upon another and the noble lord will remember that in the last social security bill we built into it a thing called a keeling schedule which is a device to make the legislation a little easier to understand <e> <s> this is in the nature of an experiment i hope that it will work i hope that it will prove to be a means of understanding legislation more satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> i never said that the noble lord was in any way simple-minded <e> <s> i think it requires very great flexibility of mind to understand the statutes <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord has agreed that there is nothing illegal in what the government are seeking to do <e>", "<cs> there are two points here <e> <s> one is that it has been said by my right honourable friend the secretary of state in another place in standing committee b that this is a budget bill <e> <s> because it is a budget bill your lordships house has a certain difficulty in handling it <e> <s> nevertheless i think the second point is closely associated with it that is that it is a matter of much concern to your lordships that so many detailed provisions concern the funding of particular parts of the budget in respect of those cuts <e> <s> we believe that the government have been very honest in your lordships house in making constant declarations that it is our aim to save money <e> <s> it is a matter of complaint by the noble lord lord wallace of coslany who said he would start screaming if we said so again now his noble friend says we have not said it enough <e>", "<cs> i listened to the noble lord lord byers with close attention because i think that there is much to be explained as regards this particular situation <e> <s> my noble friend lady young explained the position at second reading and i think that very often it helps to have an example which i shall now quote <e> <s> as the noble lord lord davies of leek said there is more to this than meets the eye <e> <s> how right he was because in the basic situation we start off with an occupational pension of for an unemployed man <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord will agree that in discussing clause it has been argued that many of those who have retired on an occupational pension have done so in the expectation that they will be able to claim unemployment benefit if they are unable to find work <e> <s> in this context it is interesting to note that the recent cohort study of a sample of unemployed men which no doubt the noble lord lord wells-pestell has read or has had the opportunity of looking at which was run for the department of health and social services reported that per cent <e> <s> of those on occupational pensions the subject with which we are concerned in this amendment had applied for unemployment benefit but were not available for work <e>", "<cs> at this stage without the survey in front of me i can only say that this was embodied in the survey carried out by the dhss <e> <s> i shall be happy to answer the question but i have not had the opportunity of looking at chapter and verse in the few moments since the noble baroness has spoken <e>", "<cs> once again i would hesitate for several long minutes before replying to my noble friend lord drumalbyn on this point <e> <s> as i have now been given a note on this perhaps i could reply at short length <e> <s> the recent survey known as the cohort study found that over half that is to say per cent <e> <s> of the unemployed men with occupational pensions of a size to be affected by this proposal admitted and that is the crucial word that they were not looking for work <e> <s> i do not know whether that satisfies either the noble lord lord drumalbyn or the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> may i now resume my argument on this amendment <e> <s> the facts are that this was borne out by the results of the survey referred to earlier over half of the unemployed men over with a pension large enough to be affected by this proposal admitted that they were not looking for work <e> <s> secondly quite apart from the issue of whether or not a pensioner is looking for work it must be remembered that unemployment benefit is extended as a short-term earnings-replacement benefit for people experiencing unforeseen periods of unemployment until they can find fresh work <e> <s> retirement <e>", "<cs> i do not think the provisions of this clause would apply <e> <s> i am not fully conversant with my noble friends situation and i would hesitate to confirm or otherwise the situation in such a particular case <e>", "<cs> i will certainly look into this matter and perhaps the noble <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wells-pestell will recollect that we had discussions on the first social security bill a matter of a month ago on the subject of the social security advisory committee and its administration <e> <s> under this clause proposals to make regulations under subsection which would allow the introduction of certain detailed operating rules or the making of regulations to extend the definition of payments by way of occupational pension must be submitted to the social security advisory committee unless they are made within six months of the royal assent to this bill <e> <s> this amendment would remove the proviso so that any regulatory proposals made within six months of royal assent would also have to be submitted first to the social security advisory committee <e>",

statement made by my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture fisheries and food in another place on the th june so far as prosecution is concerned and i draw his attention to what the

remarks i quoted my noble friend lady young in this regard because in her speech on second reading she pointed out that authorities already have power to receive hold and administer trust funds so this would be handled in the normal way <e> <s> in regard to the special types of equipment i made a specific reference to the problem of unsuitable purchases and i mentioned white elephants <e> <s> one reason why we are giving power to authorities is because it is they who know whether they can afford the consequences of their purchase <e> <s> in this context the noble lord lord wells-pestell mentioned the cost of maintaining a scanner <e> <s> as i have said <e>", "<cs> before we move further i should like to clarify this amendment <e> <s> there are really two amendments here <e> <s> one is that clause stand part and the other is the amendment the noble lord has moved <e> <s> before i reply i should just like to point this out to the noble lord lord wells-pestell <e>", "<cs> i hope we

report be adjourned until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy on the major issues under discussion at the nd annual meeting of the international whaling commission was outlined in

thanking my noble friend for his congratulations to the government and for supporting their policies in the discussions which took place a week ago at the international whaling commission there are a number of points which i should like to raise <e> <s> first the noble lord suggested that the harpoon the use of the cold grenade has not been banned <e> <s> my understanding is that it was agreed that the cold grenade would be banned virtually immediately in the case of its use against whales larger than the minki whale <e> <s> a non-binding resolution was passed to the effect that its use against minki whales should cease within about a year and the subject will be on the agenda for next years meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to the statement which my honourable friend made at the opening of the conference a copy of which i have in my hand <e> <s> i shall be pleased to give it to the noble lord <e> <s> if i were to read it all i think it would weary the house because it runs into two foolscap pages but perhaps i may have the opportunity of giving the noble lord just the gist <e> <s> the proposition was that last year the united kingdom government decided to support a ban on all commercial whaling and we stand firm on that policy <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing with the noble lord lord melchett that a number of decisions were highly unfortunate in their results especially the failure to secure the ban on commercial whaling and further to secure a total ban on the cold harpoon what the government intend to do is to continue to pursue their policies and to ensure that these items which are to be set forward in the agenda for the meeting in july next year are promoted with as much vigour as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly draw the attention of my right honourable friend the minister to the remarks of the noble lord lord melchett <e>", "<cs> my lords i have during the interval since committee stage had the opportunity to read once again lord wallace of coslanys speeches on this subject both at second reading and more recently and we are well aware of his point of view <e> <s> in the debates on this clause both here and in another place we have emphasised that we see fund-raising as an essentially local activity and on that i think we agree <e> <s> appeals for funds for local services where the benefits can clearly be seen by the local people who have contributed are the ones most likely to be successful <e> <s> we resisted an amendment in another place which would have required all locally raised funds to be distributed by the regional health authority this would have destroyed the incentive to local people to contribute <e> <s> we expect that most nhs fund-raising will be done by area and district health authorities and boards of governors <e> <s> it is at this level that it is most likely to be successful <e> <s> the noble lord lord wallace told the committee and the house at second reading of the success which his own local area had achieved and we should congratulate him on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord lord wallace will feel able to withdraw the amendment after i have spoken on the subject <e> <s> the government entirely accept his first argument that it would be wrong if the clause gave authorities power to run major lotteries but as the bill stands it does not do so and the amendment is therefore unnecessary <e> <s> i would draw the noble lords attention to the discussion that took place on second reading of the bill in another place in december of last year when my right honourable friend the secretary of state said <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house my lords i should explain that it is not in the bill because it is already subject to the terms of the act <e> <s> as to whether health authorities should have this power i explained in committee that we shall be considering separately whether to give health authorities the power to mount major lotteries <e> <s> if we wished to do that it would be achieved by an amendment to the lotteries and amusements act and the house would of course have the opportunity to debate the proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords this might be a suitable moment to adjourn the proceedings on report until eight oclock <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do adjourn the proceedings on report until eight oclock and take further business now <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friend the leader of the house i think it would be convenient to take the statement at this juncture <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to reply to a number of questions put to me by the noble lord lord wells-pestell <e> <s> of course the house will be familiar during the course of both the social security no <e> <s> and the social security no <e> <s> bills with the exaggerated language which the noble lord used on those occasions <e> <s> i recollect that he cast himself in the role of guy fawkes on one occasion and i think on another echoed the views of his right honourable and honourable friends in another place in standing committee who cast themselves in the roles of butch cassidy and the sundance kid <e> <s> i believe that this is perhaps his true role because the unhappy affliction of those two wellknown personalities was that they destroyed the very thing which was their aim and object <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true to the best of our belief but it may be only at the margin <e>", "<cs> i think it may be for the convenience of the committee if the committee stage were suspended until eight oclock <e> <s> in the meanwhile the house will be prepared to accept further business <e> <s> we have two confirmation bills on the order paper <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it may be your lordships wish to conclude the debate at this stage because my noble friend the chief whip suggested to your lordships that we should have the dinner break at approximately oclock <e> <s> i do not wish in any way to inhibit debate or to suggest that we should break at this point but it seems appropriate that at this point the noble lord lord hatch of lusby should conclude his remarks <e>", "<cs> as it was arranged through the usual channels that we should break for minutes and it was originally intended that we should do so at seven oclock i suggest that the time most appropriate for us to return would now be eight oclock <e>", "<cs> at this point i think it might be for the convenience of the committee if we were to take the dinner adjournment and return to our deliberations at eight oclock <e>", "<cs> there was an extensive debate on this matter in another place <e> <s> my noble friend lord ridley referred to the debate on th april and i have spent some time going over it <e> <s> my right honourable friends and my noble friend lord bellwin have considered this amendment with great care <e> <s> the question was of the precise meaning of the phrase as soon as may be <e> <s> our intention in using this phrase was to indicate that it should be done as soon as possible which would normally be much sooner than seven days <e> <s> as soon as possible is not a phrase which is appropriate in law and this was referred to in discussions on standing committee since it could always be agreed that however quickly the job has been done it would have been possible using some more extreme means to do it faster <e> <s> as soon as may be is an accepted form of legal wording to cover this point <e> <s> nevertheless i can understand that some people reading the bill drafted in this way might very well be left with a lingering doubt that the man with the responsibility for doing a job in a district council might not have the same interpretation of as soon as may be as the parliamentary draughtsman <e>", "<cs> this amendment raises the interesting question of whether it is necessary for county highway authorities to be able if they choose to see a copy of every planning application or whether it would be sufficient for them to see only those which the district believe could be the subject of the highway authorities power to direct refusal <e> <s> the issue goes wider than planning and falls as much if not more in the field of the department of transport as within the department of the environment <e>", "<cs> i think it may be for the convenience of the committee if we take the statement at this stage and with <e>", "<cs> in response to the group of six amendments which my noble friend lord mottistone has proposed i can at the outset say that i can give him satisfaction about four of them but not about the other two <e> <s> i do not propose to speak at great length about the amendment but it would be very much better if i drew attention to each amendment separately and i hope that that will explain the matter reasonably satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> at this stage the committee might find it convenient if i were to move that the house do now resume <e> <s> we could then take the remaining business on the order paper returning to this bill at oclock <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> the fear has been expressed that the existence of the enabling power for planning charges in clause could provide this or some future government with a means of taxation which could be used in a way which would have a particularly damaging effect on the construction industry or the situation at the time <e> <s> let me begin by making it clear that that is the reverse of the governments intention <e> <s> the purpose of planning charges is to remove part of the cost of financing the planning services from taxation and to finance it instead from a charge to the applicant <e> <s> my noble friend lord bellwin has explained this in detail <e> <s> even were we to attempt to use the power for other purposes and we have no intention of so doing noble lords would <e>", "<cs> i am replying in some detail to this amendment which was moved by my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness was looking at the next amendment <e>", "<cs> with due respect and i do mean with due respect in this case to the noble lord lord evans he is confusing a number of issues <e> <s> the government are at present reviewing the situation of the development land tax <e> <s> secondly he has spoken of the question of transferring funds from the public sector into the private sector <e> <s> surely in the case instanced by my noble friend lord bellwin and he instanced the case of someone who sought a driving licence there is a situation in which a fee is being charged for a public service <e> <s> it is a very relevant comparison <e>", "<cs> the assurances are the assurances of the governments intention <e> <s> that should be good enough for my noble friend <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord ridley chided the committee and possibly the government with having a messy discussion my response could be this in making that suggestion he omitted to explain his amendment in very much detail to the committee <e> <s> i might remedy that by informing the committee of the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> the effect of the amendment is to enable the secretary of state to make regulations prescribing that per cent <e> <s> of the fees received by district councils from planning charges should be passed to the county highway authority they consult <e>", "<cs> in response to the last question i shall have to take legal advice because my noble friend is such a great expert in this field <e> <s> i hope that he may be satisfied with that reply for the time being <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> in general terms that is acceptable <e> <s> perhaps i may take this opportunity of replying to the question about the difference between remission and refunding <e> <s> in shorthand a remission means that you do not have to pay and a refunding means that you get it back <e>", "<cs> there will be general <e>", "<cs> the government have as their policy to encourage and promote the establishment of small businesses and wherever possible we are removing bureaucratic restraints <e> <s> there was some demonstration of this on the first day of the committee stage in a speech by my noble friend lord sandford when he pointed out that the associations between them had produced a list last year of a total of controls which in their view should be dismantled governing the relationship between central and local government <e> <s> as your lordships are aware in september of last year the government produced a white paper whittling down that number to about with which they were in agreement with the associations <e>", "<cs> in rising to speak to this amendment may i first of all acknowledge the expertise of the two noble baronesses who first spoke <e> <s> the noble baroness lady stedman of course has long years of experience on the peterborough new town corporation and may i say how warmly we welcome the fact that the noble baroness lady denington spoke with such obvious knowledge and feeling of her very long experience on the stevenage new town corporation <e> <s> it is one of the great justifications in your lordships house that those who address us on particular subjects speak from profound knowledge and i think it is a particular privilege to listen to speeches which have been delivered with such conviction <e>", "<cs> i have every intention of doing it at the earliest possible moment <e>", "<cs> i recognise the point made by the noble lord lord avebury and of course he is perfectly right <e> <s> but there is a remedy which would be open to the noble lord lord ross of marnock and that is to put down either a starred question or a question for written answer <e> <s> i do not know whether either those courses of action recommend themselves they probably do not in view of the timescale involved <e> <s> nevertheless it is extremely difficult to meet the point of detail and i am sure that the noble lord lord ross would not wish me to make an ill-considered reply without the full information for which he has asked <e>", "<cs> i think that i can to some extent satisfy the noble lord lord mishcon on his first question <e> <s> i can quote two precedents <e> <s> one is in the new towns act itself <e> <s> if the noble lord will examine it he will find it under section which gives power for the secretary of state to give directions <e>", "<cs> in this particular case i think that the noble lord has dealt with his point <e>", "<cs> nevertheless i shall certainly take up the noble lords invitation because he offered me the alternative of the opportunity to consider and that i shall do <e>", "<cs> i think that i must reply to noble lords <e> <s> perhaps i may attempt to answer the noble baroness lady denington because she speaks with such knowledge and such passion on this subject <e> <s> i could remind her that stevenage corporation was one of the very first new towns set up immediately after the second world war <e> <s> of course it was founded upon initial loans of government money of taxpayers money <e> <s> i think that the noble baroness will also recognise that in terms of economic circumstances we are in a vastly different situation today <e> <s> values have changed and the circumstances of doing so have changed very considerably <e> <s> it is because stevenage corporation was raised upon public money that there is of course a question of public accountability and i am sure that the noble baroness would be the first to recognise that point <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon has not been satisfied at this stage <e> <s> but we believe that the policy that the government are pursuing in regard to new towns is most emphatically demanded by the circumstances in which we live <e>", "<cs> i can only tell the noble baroness that i have not so been briefed and that i hope to receive the information at a later stage <e> <s> i do not think i can add to that for the time being <e>", "<cs> in moving this amendment the noble baroness lady david spoke to amendments nos <e> <s> and and i hope that the committee will agree that i should follow her in that manner <e> <s> i can see no point in this amendment for the reason that if as the provision states a corporation cannot dispose of a freehold or long leasehold without my right honourable friends consent it is surely implicit that the consent must be given before the disposal is made <e> <s> i imagine that my right honourable friend would not be best pleased should his consent be sought to a <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall be able to satisfy my noble friend lord morris with an explanation <e> <s> development corporations have had power since the original new towns act to grant leases of up to years without requiring ministerial consent <e> <s> i think that is common ground between us <e> <s> we would not wish to be restrictive in the granting of leases and at present the secretary of state has given a general consent for leases of up to years where development corporations and the commissions for the new towns exercise their existing powers of disposal <e> <s> but the figure of years is parallel with that in the new towns act and a change to years would be confusing <e> <s> we do not believe that the clause as it stands will in any way penalise or discourage firms intending to invest in the new towns and i therefore call upon my noble friend to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think the committee will be grateful to the noble baroness for grouping the amendments as she did <e>", "<cs> i think this is a matter for speculation <e> <s> one can envisage a number of different circumstances which might make it extremely difficult possibly when there has been quite substantial consultation previously and then there is an urgent need perhaps to implement a decision <e>", "<cs> if i have given a reply which did not sufficiently recommend itself to the committee i apologise <e> <s> there can be circumstances in which discussions may take place in general terms or perhaps on a rather broad basis for the disposal of certain assets anticipating either a market or a set of circumstances <e> <s> it may well be that it is possible that because of the conditions of the market it may not be possible to have a further series of discussions to implement the decision <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness need not worry overmuch because a provision whereby the secretary of state need not consult a corporation because of urgency is not one which she is likely to need to use often <e> <s> however it would be useful if for example the property market was falling rapidly and the secretary of state therefore wished temporarily to restrict the release of further assets for sale <e> <s> this is a decision which must be made <e>", "<cs> i would be misleading the committee if i gave that assurance <e> <s> we feel very clear in our minds that there would be circumstances in which it would be extraordinarily valuable to have this reserve power <e> <s> i gave the assurance in my last reply that it would be a reserve power for particular occasions <e> <s> i feel i can go no further than that <e>", "<cs> clause enables the secretary of state to make an order reducing the designated area of a new town as the noble baroness has reminded the committee <e> <s> such orders will be necessary because substantial areas of the third generation new towns are unlikely to be required for development following the decision in to reduce the towns target population <e> <s> the noble baroness reminded the committee about this in the case of peterborough <e> <s> it is desirable that the superfluous land should be de <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness takes that course of action perhaps i could reply to her in greater detail <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will bear with me if i add a few remarks about the background to the clause and the amendment <e> <s> first i should like to take your lordships back to the designation of the sites of the new towns <e> <s> the minister is given power in section of the new towns act to designate an area as the site of a new town if this is expedient in the national interest <e> <s> if we now turn to the powers of de-designation of some of this land we find the same test of expediency being applied <e> <s> this is appropriate because both designation and de-designation of new town land is primarily a matter of national interest <e>", "<cs> i am sure that it will be the wish of the committee to take these two amendments together and i think that we should congratulate my noble and eagle-eyed friend on spotting this flaw in the drafting of the bill <e> <s> indeed it is the wish of the government for every bill to leave your lordships house in perfect condition and i accept both amendments with alacrity <e>", "<cs> once again the government are indeed grateful to my noble friend who has spotted a fault in the drafting <e> <s> superfluous words in the drafting must be removed and once more i accept this amendment with alacrity <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the noble lord lord mishcon that it is a custom of this house to speak only once on report <e> <s> i think the noble lord has stretched the tolerance of the house on this group of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords at the conclusion of clause there appears to be a natural break and i think it has been agreed through the usual channels that it would be for the convenience of your lordships if we adjourned the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it will be for the convenience of the house if we now adjourn during pleasure until oclock for reconsideration of the local government bill on report <e>", "<cs> my lords at this juncture your lordships might appreciate our suspending consideration of the bill on report <e> <s> i beg to move therefore that the house do now adjourn consideration on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i must protest to the noble lord lord hale who is intervening in the speech of my noble friend lord fortescue <e> <s> he is making an excessively long intervention and if he wishes a reply he certainly will not get one

amendment <e> <s> he has not chosen to use the device before the noble lord sits down <e> <s> therefore i regret to say he is out of order <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so my noble friend the minister has summed up on a motion because we are now on report <e> <s> if i may quote the <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the noble baroness lady david who has spoken to this clause we believe that clause is a necessary consequence of clause <e> <s> in fact it is a corollary of it as it expands the power of the development corporations and the commission for the new towns to dispose of land <e> <s> the present powers contained in the and acts restrict each towns disposals to those necessary to secure the development of a particular town <e> <s> this clause gives clear-cut powers for the new towns to dispose of land in order to comply with the secretary of states directions under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this might be a suitable moment to adjourn and reassemble at pm to give further consideration on report to this bill <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i must remind my noble friend that the question has been put and therefore he is out of order in making a speech however welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships have listened to two very interesting amendments and as they have been put forward with much skill by the noble lord lord mishcon on two occasions now and behind them stands the law society i feel that they would be a matter of great interest to your lordships <e> <s> the noble lord had just said that not much harm is to be attached to the words of the second amendment but as we are going to deal with both amendments together perhaps i may be permitted to tackle them in like manner to the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise both to the noble lord lord mishcon and to the house <e> <s> i did not hear that and i must not have been listening <e> <s> i believe that this amendment and its successor are both very much more technical in nature and very much more substantial in nature than your lordships have perhaps been led to believe <e> <s> this is not something that can be done within the timescale of this bill <e> <s> the governments own proposals have had to be dropped because of lack of space as i have said already and because this subject bears only a peripheral relation to the provisions of this bill <e> <s> there are other interested parties outside government who should be given an opportunity to give their views <e> <s> my lords the governments own proposals have evoked considerable differences of opinion and i would ask the noble lord lord mishcon therefore to accept my assurances that we will look further into this matter in the light both of his proposals and of our different proposals and would ask him to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord withdraws his amendment i should like to make one point clear <e> <s> as we see it we believe the first amendment goes much too far in making all documents valid on planning decisions no matter what misdemeanour has taken place <e> <s> my noble friend lord colville of culross has indicated so clearly to your lordships a misdemeanour which happened in a particular instance and a second one <e> <s>

observations <e>", "<cs> my lords it could have been raised before the noble lord rose or it can be raised by letter or by word of mouth <e>", "<cs> my lords it is customary when the minister has made

that the purpose of these amendments is to introduce certainty for the owner occupier i must point out to my noble friend that there are cases where such wording could defeat the whole object of the clause in our view quite unnecessarily <e> <s> i speak of cases where legal ownership or occupancy cannot be ascertained in circumstances for instance where there is multiple ownership or where the land is common land and no owner is known <e>", "<cs> i hate to disappoint my noble friend lord craigton but i am afraid that the government believe that the amendment is misconceived <e> <s> the words directly affected do not have a very clear meaning but may seem when added to the words owners or occupiers to refer to the ownership or occupation of land in the area with respect to which the order is to be made <e> <s> this position is already covered since the word those which immediately precedes the words owners or occupiers takes one back to the owners or occupiers referred to in clause <e>", "<cs> the intention of this amendment is to provide powers of revocation and i submit that this amendment is adequately covered by clause of the bill and by the provisions of the interpretation act whereby a power to revoke or amend is implied <e> <s> i would therefore ask your lordships to reject it <e>", "<cs> no i think it is not correct <e> <s> i should have to take legal

reply to a number of important points raised by the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> he made a quite specific point about the definition of livestock and the reason for the removal of the word and the definition from the bill <e> <s> the reason is that because livestock has been included in the new defence clause for birds and the definition in the bill as drafted is contrary to the eec directive on birds suitable amendments have been tabled to deal with the mammals clauses later on <e> <s> this seems somewhat contradictory advice but i am assured that we are following the eec directive here

definition will be inserted by amendment in the mammals clauses <e>", "<cs> i think it would be for the convenience of the committee if at this stage i answered a number of the points raised by my noble friends and by noble lords opposite <e> <s> my noble friend lord stanley of alderley referred to damage to corn in a granary <e> <s> we think action in that kind of emergency would be justified on the grounds of public health <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend lord caithness referred to the young of domesticated red deer and so far as our information exists at the present time they are to be included <e> <s> if at a later stage in their lives the young were no longer domesticated and were released into the wild they would not be included but that is our understanding at the present

noble friends and noble lords <e>", "<cs> i wish i were able to accede to the noble lords suggestion <e> <s> the defences listed in clause are all separate <e> <s> the or at the end of paragraph <e>", "<cs> i think the committee has been very correct in looking at amendments nos <e> <s> and together and amendments nos <e> <s> and together in the way the noble lord lord melchett has suggested <e>

nest of a wild bird would be damaged or destroyed while in use <e> <s> this would nullify the whole of purpose of clause <e>", "<cs> i think that there is a case and clearly having listened to my noble friend lord craigton there is a particular problem here which should be looked at in regard to the use of the word incidental <e> <s> i think that at this stage it would be very helpful if the noble lord lord melchett were able to withdraw the amendment and perhaps we may be able to examine the definition <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the programme and as this debate is due to close at i

baroness lady david but i believe that the fears which have been expressed are exaggerated <e> <s> we have had very long and detailed discussions with the national councils for aviculture the british birds council and other avicultural organisations who were legitimately concerned at the very far-reaching changes we are proposing in this clause <e> <s> we believe that the bill as drafted gives considerable additional protection to birds from those who might be tempted to take them from the wild to win a competition <e> <s> it should be remembered that most of those species meriting special protection and listed on schedule are also listed on schedule as being required to be registered and ringed if kept in captivity <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble lord lord donaldson yes regulations

just one of several examples <e> <s> the noble baroness lady david asked whether the rspb was included in the consultations <e> <s> yes the rspb most emphatically was <e>", "<cs> i cannot give the noble baroness that assurance but their views are very closely taken into consideration <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton raised a very interesting matter from the notes on clauses and i think he raised the question of clause on this <e> <s> the government are going to have another look at this <e> <s> in view of the fact that my noble friend lord chelwood did specifically make that further request with that assurance and on the undertaking that we will consider all these matters raised on this amendment i hope he will feel able to withdraw his amendments <e>", "<cs> i would remind the noble lord lord donaldson that we shall be coming later to amendments nos <e> <s> and which make quite specific amendments to that list <e> <s> i wonder whether it would be beyond the remit of this

advise my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord melchett and the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby will be pleased to hear what i have to say <e> <s> the amendment seeks to make a conviction for the ill-treatment of other animals a reason for preventing a person being registered to sell dead birds or for securing the removal of such a person from the register <e> <s> i have listened with great interest to the noble lord lord houghton and his reasons for this step and accept the logic of the amendment <e> <s> however the governments legal advisers feel that there is a simpler way of amending clauses and and we shall therefore table an appropriate amendment at the report stage <e> <s> i hope that with that assurance the noble lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord renton has raised a number of material matters in regard to the registration of taxidermists as a profession <e> <s> i think that it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further at this stage other than to say that i shall draw the attention of my noble friend and my right honourable friend to the remarks that he has made <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge i should like to say that we shall certainly advise him if we are not intending to bring forward an amendment at report stage <e>", "<cs> i must oppose

noble lord inquired about if justification for such sale can be given and subject of course to the <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting discussion on these two amendments <e> <s> perhaps t may lead into my reply to amendments nos <e> <s> and by referring to the noble lords previous amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the question of our obligations under the eec directive is really fundamental to the whole argument <e> <s> i should like to remind the noble lord lord kilbracken of the position within the eec and why it is in its present state <e> <s> the french and the italians see no hope of stopping the shooting of pigeons and wood pigeons so they control the sale <e>", "<cs> i listened with interest to the points raised by the noble lord lord kilbracken for consideration on schedule before report stage <e> <s> i note all that he said in regard to the capercaillie and the quail <e> <s> for schedule part i we have introduced a new principle that birds which may be shown or sold alive must only be those that breed readily in captivity <e> <s> that has reduced the list by half but we believe it will be an incentive to agriculturalists and bird fanciers to co-operate in breeding programmes which will allow more and more species to be ncluded in schedule <e> <s> a corollary of inclusion is that licences to take further birds of these species would normally only be given for gene replenishment and on the advice of agricultural experts <e>", "<cs> i greatly admire the way in which the noble lord lord kilbracken leads us through these very difficult names of species and it is a matter of regret that i rise to oppose the amendment <e> <s> it has never been our intention to include true hawks or to give them their other name old world vultures in schedule as birds which must be registered and ringed if kept in captivity <e> <s> these birds are neither indigenous to the united kingdom nor do they at any time in their life-cycle resemble the hawks which are resident here <e> <s> i submit that their inclusion in schedule would serve no useful purpose <e> <s> accordingly i ask your lordships to reject this amendment <e>", "<cs> to reply to my noble friend lord craigton i am afraid i do not have the information before me <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilbracken will perhaps be interested to know that at their meeting on th january the advisory committee said that many people would be unaware that the term true hawks would include birds such as eagles <e> <s> they recommend that this should somehow be made clear in the schedules and this is being considered <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not a matter for which her majestys government are responsible but page of the research study discusses the problems of terminology and explains the

recruited and trained in much the same way possesses powers limited to property used by the british railways board london transport executive british transport docks board and associated undertakings

question refers to prosecutions and as the research study shows the british transport police prosecutes its own offences in much the same way as the civil police although unlike most civil police forces in england and wales it has no central prosecuting solicitors department so this is a technicality <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble baroness is out of order because there was a question to be put from the cross-benches by the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that we have spent minutes on this statement and the noble lord lord harris of high cross has been waiting so patiently perhaps we may return to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords for the government i should like to say that the bill to which the house is invited to give a third reading tonight has found a wide measure of support among your lordships <e> <s> indeed the only amendments which the house has seen fit to make during the passage of the bill have been moved by the noble lord lord wigoder himself and none of those has affected the basic principle of the bill <e> <s> as my noble friend lord belstead said on the occasion of the third reading of the noble lords bill in the last session of parliament this bill too is in every sense lord wigoders bill <e> <s> indeed if it is given a third reading by your lordships house the government for their part will watch with interest to see whether it also commands support when it is considered in another place <e>", "<cs> under section of the protection of birds act it is already mandatory for the court to seize the subject of the offence and to accept the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord kilbracken would merely give the court discretion on such a seizure which would be a dilution of the penalty <e> <s> it is important that offenders should have no opportunity of enjoying the fruits of their crimes and accordingly i request your lordships to reject this amendment and to continue to compel the court to seize the specimens <e>", "<cs> the subsection does say <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kilbracken has raised a very interesting anomaly <e> <s> i think this must have occurred to all those who read the bill with some care as the noble lord undoubtedly has done <e> <s> certainly there are some extreme cases in which such a situation could arise and undoubtedly the position has certain complications to which perhaps noble lords have already drawn attention <e>", "<cs> with the agreement of the committee <e> <s> if any member of the committee disagrees to it i think we should put the question <e>", "<cs> we are in a slightly more complicated position here <e> <s> the governments amendment no <e> <s> which was accepted by the committee has already ensured that a court shall

not wish to see it weakened <e> <s> convicted persons should not be allowed to enjoy the fruits of their crimes as i have already suggested and i feel despite the arguments put forward by the noble lord that in its present shape this amendment is not acceptable <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord houghton draws our attention to a particularly interesting part of the drafting of this bill <e> <s> i think i can assure the noble lord that the situation has been thought about by our parliamentary counsel and i can set his mind at rest <e> <s> the amendment seeks to allow a court to confiscate any vehicle animal weapon or other thing <e> <s> however the bill as drafted provides for this <e> <s> the words any thing cover a vehicle an animal <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to the noble lord lord melchett who rightly referred to section of the deer act <e> <s> i think that it would be only right once more to consider the situation in a little detail <e> <s> i cannot advise the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby that the government will bring forward their own amendment if necessary <e> <s> however in the light of what has been said by all noble lords concerned the bill introduced by the noble lord lord northfield has been mentioned we shall have a look at this provision <e> <s> on that understanding i hope that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> to put my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard on the right lines regarding the governments thinking on this matter we are going to examine the clause <e> <s>

amendment <e> <s> i feel sure that there is ample justification for having another look at it <e> <s> i do not think that on consideration looking at the penalties clause the government have underestimated the seriousness of the offence or indeed offences because sometimes it may be a group of offences <e> <s> i hope that the noble viscount will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>",

section in an existing statute and it reinforces the waterproof nature of the amendment <e>", "<cs> order <e> <s> my lords we are speaking on report and i think that the noble lord lord gifford is testing the rules of this house <e>", "<cs> i think it may be appropriate at this stage if in replying to the amendment i referred to a number of other matters since it may help to allay the fears of

impose any unnecessary costraint on their owners or occupiers where powers already exist which enable local authorities to control access <e> <s> i commend these powers to their consideration <e> <s>

contribution which the limestone pavements make in the landscape is not in any way debased <e>", "<cs> i would not be able to give that assurance and it would be an impertinence on my part to comment on anything that the noble lord lord winstanley has said as former chairman of the countryside commission because he has already identified many of the areas in which limestone pavements exist <e> <s>

by-laws made by the nature <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> this amendment anticipates to some extent amendment no <e> <s> which seeks to enlarge the functions of the nature conservancy council <e> <s> i do not wish to anticipate our discussion on that amendment but merely to address my remarks to the amendment as it stands <e> <s> the intention of clause is to enlarge the councils scope for providing financial assistance by grant and now by loan to projects which are in their opinion conducive to nature conservation or again in their opinion would engender an understanding of nature conservation <e> <s> the amendment seeks to enlarge this function still further in that it would be possible for the nature conservancy council if the amendment were carried to provide financial assistance for anything which was conducive to the study of natural history <e> <s> that i am sure is a worthy cause but it is not entirely appropriate for the purposes carried out by the nature conservancy council <e> <s> that is nature conservation and nature conservation implies a certain end product and a certain physical wellbeing or preservation <e> <s> but the study of natural history may be undertaken for no other purpose than sheer interest and why not <e>", "<cs> in this international year of the disabled we want to make every effort within available resources to help disabled people enjoy the benefits of countryside recreation but it would be unwise to interfere with the judgment of the nature conservancy council and the national park authorities in their consideration of projects for grant aid <e> <s> clauses and leave these bodies free to impose on a grant any conditions that they think fit <e> <s> they are public bodies and we should trust them to pay proper regard to the needs of the handicapped <e> <s> the national park committees are in any case as organs of local government bound by statutory obligations placed on local authorities generally by the chronically sick and disabled persons act <e>", "<cs> i think it has been of great benefit to hear both the noble lord lord winstanley and my noble friend lord chelwood respond to the suggestions which have been made <e> <s> the government are very sensitive to the situation regarding the disabled in this particular year and i shall be happy to consider the position in a little more detail especially after what the noble lord lord winstanley has said and if it would benefit the position of the disabled generally to cast a statutory obligation upon a public body i think we should consider it again before report stage <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to all noble lords who have spoken to the proposed new clause but i must say at the outset that i agree with my noble friend lord chelwood that there are a number of misapprehensions <e> <s> for example one point mentioned by the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley could be misleading he said that subsection of his proposal had been accepted by the government in the debate on amend <e>", "<cs> it is indeed the position but there is a mildly grey area here the word accept means accept and the word consider means consider <e>", "<cs> i feel that my noble friend lord radnor is raising a valuable point but i cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords no such decision has been made <e> <s> separate control points for european community nationals continue to function at heathrow airport and at dover <e> <s> there is no proposal to abolish them <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that my noble friend is fully aware of the background of this situation which is rather more complicated than may be apparent from the question on the order paper <e> <s> under the transitional arrangements for the entry of greece to the european community greeks will not benefit from the free movement of labour provisions in the treaty until seven years after the date of their countrys accession which was of course st january <e> <s> thus the examination of greek immigration control can be comparatively lengthy <e> <s> at ports where they arrive in large numbers it would hinder the flow of other european community passengers if they were examined in the same channel <e> <s> for this reason it was decided that greeks should not use the european community channel at terminals and at heathrow to which my noble friend referred or at dover west or dover hoverport <e> <s> sometimes the greeks have joined the european community channel at these ports the result has been congestion and delay which has given rise to the complaint mentioned by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but it arises in the difference between our immigration policy in this country and those of our continental partners <e> <s> a land frontier occurs in the case of almost all our partners whereas it does not of course in this country and we follow a different policy <e> <s> so far as improvement is concerned the british airports authority is establishing the closest relationship with the home office immigration services <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter is under review <e> <s> the house will be aware from my previous statement where the difficulties arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be appropriate to remind my noble friend that this item is <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are touching upon an area which is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord noel-baker told the house that his watch had stopped <e> <s> unfortunately no similar facility affords your lordships this evening because we are in the course of a timed debate <e> <s> the remaining three speakers will i regret <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the noble lord will have only about six minutes <e> <s> i hope he will restrict himself to that period because this is a timed debate <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments are the same as the ones which were put down in committee and it has been suggested by a number of noble lords that the power of veto to owners and occupiers has done a good deal to emasculate the sanctuary order provisions of the act and has led to only sanctuaries under the present act i think that that figure was given by the noble lord lord melchett <e>", "<cs> my lords i will with permission also speak to amendment no <e> <s> b already spoken to by my noble friend lord burton <e> <s> this makes similar alterations in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords as we are on report stage we are in danger of falling out of order <e> <s> i recognise that the noble lord lord melchett was trying to be helpful to the house <e> <s> in a brief moment my noble friend lord avon will be returning to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords the promise made by the government in committee to refer this matter back to the advisory committee in the light of arguments put forward by your lordships has been carried out <e> <s> both the england and the scotland sub-committees have confirmed that there is no conservation case for removing any of these birds from the quarry list <e> <s> a majority of the england committee recommended the removal of the species on ethical and sentimental grounds <e> <s> they felt that public opinion on this matter had moved on since the passage of the act and there was a general feeling that those who still hunted these species should now fall into line with the remainder and that there was a good case for protection to be given <e> <s> the opposite view was equally strongly held namely that it was quite a legitimate sporting activity to hunt the species <e> <s> the scotland committee took the view notwithstanding these arguments that the species should remain on the quarry list but again there were dissenters <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in committee part i of schedule represents a major change to the existing provision governing aviculture <e> <s> indeed i would say that the schedule and clause represent notwithstanding the and acts the first real attempt to make proper provision for aviculture and to place it on a sound and logical basis for the future <e> <s> your lordships know that in future only those birds included in schedule part i and if captive bred and close ringed may be sold <e> <s> this represents a major reduction on the present list of saleable birds in schedule of the bill <e> <s> additionally only those species may be competitively exhibited for which there is no counterpart in existing legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords our difficulty is that there is a misprint on the marshalled list <e> <s> the marshalled list to which much care and attention has been given appears to have a missing letter <e> <s> the letters za should appear after amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords although the noble baroness argued her case well i regret to tell her that there are defects in the amendment <e> <s> further the comparison she drew with birds is not that precise as i will show <e> <s> the aim of the amendment is to restrict the trade in plants which have been taken from the wild <e> <s> the extent to which horticulturists take wild plants or parts of them from the wild and then sell them is unknown at present <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will patiently await my next sentence she will probably see that that point is well understood <e> <s> as the noble baroness knows to take plants from the wild would be an offence under existing legislation <e> <s> the conser <e>", "<cs> my lords at the present moment i cannot put my finger on the precise part of the bill but i shall attempt to obtain advice on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be to the benefit of the house if i were to expand a little on this matter <e> <s> i recognise that the noble lord lord melchett is perfectly entitled to a full reply as indeed is the noble baroness in regard to her amendment <e> <s> the question that we have to face in relation to the amendment of the noble baroness is whether we need to place a requirement on a trader in plants which appear in schedule and a number of those featured in schedule are available commercially to show that what he is selling are from cultivated stock and not obtained from the wild because if the amendment is carried the assumption will be that if he is selling a schedule plant it will be a wild plant unless he can show otherwise <e>", "<cs> but the thrust of the amendment is to put the burden of proof on the defendant <e>", "<cs> i think that perhaps it would be for the benefit of the noble baroness if i were to expand on this a little further <e> <s> i do not think it would probably be the wish of the house to be without this information <e> <s> the government have no idea of the extent of the trade in what are truly wild plants on schedule and what is carried on at the present moment <e> <s> without certainty therefore there is indeed a real threat to our stock of protected wild plants from such activities and we would be reluctant to place a further obligation upon firms and individuals engaged in selling plants <e> <s> the bill as drafted therefore makes it an offence to sell a wild plant on schedule unless of course a licence has been granted but it will be for the prosecution to show that the plant was wild and not cultivated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord lord kilbracken and with the leave of the house i think i should say that although we had thought that we had every comma in the right place clearly we must bow to his close inspection of the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of lord melchetts amendment is clear <e> <s> i can assure him that we have considered this again since the committee stage <e> <s> he said that he had not received a letter about it <e> <s> i do not know precisely the background of what correspondence he hoped would take place upon it <e> <s> i think perhaps i should say this it is the governments view however that anyone who is determined to release creatures to the wild for which he would otherwise require a licence is not likely to declare such an intention on import <e> <s> however i think we can meet the noble lords point under the endangered species act by asking on the application form for import what is the purpose of the import and particularly whether release into the wild is intended <e> <s> this will have the effect of reminding importers of the constraints and a false declaration under the endangered species act application will also render the licence-holder subject to prosecution on that count <e> <s> in view of this assurance i trust the noble lord will be prepared to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to the reasons given by the noble baroness in her amendment and also to the speeches by the noble lord lord kilbracken and the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley <e> <s> i regret to say the government must oppose the amendment <e> <s> however i can offer some comfort in a form of words deliberately assist to grow is possibly an improvement on the words otherwise causes to grow which are included in clause as drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have to take advice on that but my impression is that it appears to run counter to the bill as drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords schedule is designed only to ensure that further specimens of species already introduced into the wild in great britain are not introduced without full evaluation of the likely consequences <e> <s> if subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not in front of me the copy of the letter sent to my noble friend lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> i am

believed to have been introduced into this country in norman times i agree with my noble friend that it is precisely this sort of animal whose introduction should be controlled <e> <s> i should therefore be pleased to consider the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think that i should first assure the noble lord lord melchett that correspondence will certainly be copied to him <e> <s> in reply to my noble friend lord stanley of alderley my noble friend did ask about translocation the moving of species from one part to another <e> <s> clause does not cover translocation in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley for the care with which he has explained his concern to protect areas of special scientific interest both on this occasion and when he moved a similar amendment during the committee stage as well as for agreeing to consider the proposal which was put to him at that time that access orders might provide a suitable means of control <e> <s> the government too have been considering this question since the committee stage <e> <s> i now appreciate that access orders would not be an appropriate way of controlling activities of the public which might harm such areas <e> <s> however i am still not convinced that the amendment as it stands is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend would restrict his remarks to the first two amendments that he has mentioned because i think that it would be for the convenience of the house if we spoke to amendments nos <e> <s> and za together to which he has alluded <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> za which of course is the amendment proposed by the noble baroness lady david if we are to accept amendment no <e> <s> i entirely agree that the amendment to the amendment should first he accepted <e> <s> turning to amendment no <e> <s> i think that the house will be glad that my noble friend lord inglewood has returned to this particular subject because i believe that there is an advantage in providing that district councils as well as county councils should at least be informed of the existence of limestone pavements in their areas <e> <s> i also see no objection to the suggestion that the countryside commission should notify local authorities of pavements in their areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot definitely give the noble baroness the assurance that she desires <e> <s> i believe this to be true but in bringing forward the final shape of this important amendment which we undertake to do in consultation with the noble lord the best thing is for that point to be considered at that time <e> <s> therefore we would look at this once more at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i take this opportunity of replying to a question put by the noble baroness in regard to revocation of orders <e> <s> i am advised that a county planning authority may revoke such orders as she mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that it would be desirable to make sure that clause does not cover large areas of limestone which are not limestone pavements <e> <s> accordingly i shall be pleased to consider the amendment <e> <s> however it may well be that the amendment does not itself achieve that purpose because of the width of the wording in clause <e>",

question <e> <s> he went on to say that he wished to ensure that the traditional rights of such people should not be prejudiced <e> <s> in moving the present amendment my noble friend lord mowbray and stourton has explained the concern about protection of traditional rights <e> <s> it may be a help to the house if i say that the proviso to section of the national parks and access to the countryside

withdraw the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the intentions of the noble lord lord kilmarnock in moving this amendment but i fear that in its present form i cannot accept it <e> <s> we listened with interest to the fact that he had taken very careful legal advice upon the background to the amendment but i fear that the final part of the amendment is defective in assuming wrongly that detention under the mental health act is for a fixed period <e> <s> detention is of course renewable at intervals which are being shortened under the provisions of the bill we are now debating <e>", "<cs> i think this juncture is the appropriate moment to suggest that we break for a dinner adjournment of three quarters of an hour and take during the adjournment further business <e>

advice which the mental health act commission will i have no doubt include in the code of practice <e> <s> it is difficult to make provision about the kind of consultation which would be involved in the precise terms required in a statute <e> <s> i am sure noble lords would agree with that <e> <s> that would involve considerations of such matters as which relatives should be consulted and which professionals <e> <s> and what about the views of unqualified staff like ward orderlies who may have close contact with the patient <e> <s> the position is not quite as straightforward as may be thought at first sight <e> <s> the code of practice will be able to give practical advice which will be much more helpful to those concerned than anything we however well intentioned attempt to enshrine in a statute and i believe we should leave it to the commission <e> <s> i am sure they will take note of this debate <e>", "<cs> yes i made that perfectly clear <e>", "<cs> this might be the right juncture at which to comment on the three amendments that is amendments nos <e> <s> and b <e> <s> the noble <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to my noble friend for what he has just said

wallace in his amendment has previously imagined <e> <s> we shall have a look at this and consider it <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will table amendments and that my noble friend lady faithfull will consider with us this particular aspect <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the concern behind the amendment proposed by my noble friend lord mottistone to make sure that local authorities retain the freedom to make their own judgments about what arrangements need to be made <e> <s> from the discussion on earlier amendments it will be clear to the committee that we attach great importance to the development of additional training for social workers who carry out duties under the act <e> <s> that is why we have made it a requirement that local authorities should have regard to such matters as my right honourable friend the secretary of state may direct on this subject <e> <s> we have in mind here the draft guidance about approval and training for approval on which as i have said we are currently consulting the local authorities and relevant professional bodies <e> <s> i feel sure that the local authorities will welcome the guidelines because their use will ensure that all social workers undertaking duties under the act have received adequate specialised training and are experienced in dealing with mental disorder <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to have the support and welcome given to this order by the noble lord lord peart in the terms he used and in the way in which he said that he believes that this order which the government are now putting forward will be of benefit to our fishing industry <e> <s> it is true to say that the arrangements proposed in this order follow as a direct consequence from the legislation a year ago <e> <s> i shall certainly pass on to my

the sandford amendment and bears his name is section <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> so far as the application of the regulations to farm buildings is concerned i would like to remind the noble lord

i will certainly draw my right honourable friends attention to the remarks the noble lord has made and to the earlier exchanges <e>", "<cs> my lords we debated this amendment as the noble lord lord winstanley rightly said it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder with the leave of the house and one is very much aware that we are speaking on report whether it would be helpful to the noble baroness if i tried to say a little more because i think she is still as anxious as she was in committee about this situation <e> <s> she has quoted to her certain knowledge cases where the situation has gone wrong <e> <s> she is taking this as the base for assuming that the arrangements made in the course of this bill would be unsatisfactory and unworkable in those cases <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the amendment moved by the noble baroness which deals with a very important matter may i say that we are thinking along virtually the same lines <e> <s> we touched on this issue in committee <e>

open to them when considering discharge <e> <s> one relevant passage has already been quoted by the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> we therefore intend to provide in the rules made by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for the procedure of the mental health review tribunals that tribunals may recommend a transfer to another hospital <e> <s> we also intend to provide that where the tribunals recommendations are not met within a certain period the tribunal may reconvene to consider why and what action should now be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lor kilmarnock advised the house that he had drafte this amendment after discussion with consultan psychiatrists <e> <s> i support the underlying intention of this amendment <e> <s> your lordships will have noticed that my noble friend lord elton usually talks about the independent doctor rather than the full legal phrase the medical practitioner appointed for the purposes of this section by the secretary of state <e>

officer <e> <s> the mental health act commission will wish to ensure that he is truly independent of the responsible medical officer and i hope that may go some way towards reassuring the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite clear that the noble baroness has drawn to herself a body of opinion throughout the house which welcomes the terms in which the amendment has been drafted <e> <s> in this respect the government are not standing aside because as will emerge from my remarks nothing divides us on this point <e> <s> i was most grateful for what my noble friend lord auckland said about the role which voluntary organisations have to play <e> <s> i was also most grateful to the right reverend prelate the bishop of norwich for what he said in regard to this whole field <e> <s> perhaps it would be invidious to identify particular voluntary organisations but in this respect it is most important to remember the noble baronesss introductory sentence in which she referred to the role of the community health councils <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord may be under a misapprehension <e> <s> this amendment does not appear in the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like to open my argument on this by referring the noble lord lord kilmarnock to proceedings in committee on monday st february at column where my noble friend lord elton said this <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now spent minutes on this very important statement and are returning to the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch has asked my noble friend lord trefgarne a question <e> <s> i would remind him that after a speech lasting minutes and if one assumes that the later speakers speak for the same length of time he will have to assume that my

my lords before moving the adjournment of the house i feel sure that your lordships will permit me on your behalf to express our united thanks to the staff of your lordships house the clerks doorkeepers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside should really restrict his remarks <e> <s> it is really excessive of him to make so long a speech in asking a question of that nature <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not speaking strictly relevantly to the debate and i think that it would be the wish of the house to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord noel-baker would restrict his remarks to a question and not make a speech it would assist the house <e>", "<cs> order order <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord wells-pestell is injecting into our discussions an element which is not wholly helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord like to withdraw his motion <e>", "<cs> my lords the commissioner is appointed by her majesty the queen under section of the metropolitan police act and the government have no intention of altering that arrangement <e> <s> i must however say that i deplore the remarks made by the chairman of the glc about the recently announced appointment of sir kenneth newman to succeed sir david mcnee as metropolitan police commissioner next october <e> <s> sir kenneth has a long and distinguished record of service with the police and i believe he is entitled to look to leaders of the community for their goodwill and support in the exacting task he will face <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am happy to give the assurance that my noble friend seeks <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary has repeatedly made it clear that the government do not intend to alter the arrangement relating to the metropolitan police <e> <s> successive governments of all complexions have consistently taken the view that arrangements for london are justified by the nature of the problem of policing the capital city and seat of government and also by the fact that the force provides a number of services on a national basis <e>", "<cs> my lords while recognising that my noble friend has considerable knowledge in this area i should like to draw his attention to a very recent document the report of the noble and learned lord lord scarman on the subject of the brixton riots in which he made specific reference to the appointment of the metropolitan commissioner <e> <s> i draw my noble friends attention to page of the report and ask him to note the words of the noble and

scarman is making an addenda to his comments <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my noble friend has got it right <e> <s> this is why the independence of the police authority be it at county or metropolitan level is the one thing which is sought <e>", "<cs> my lords successful marketing depends on efficient production and quality as well as market supply <e> <s> the government are helping to achieve this through the capital grant schemes an extensive research and development programme free advice from the agricultural development and advisory service and measures to improve quality <e> <s> they have also made a major contribution on marketing apples by their financial support for the kingdom scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords the efforts being made by her majestys government are against a background in which there is no price determination for apples under the arrangements <e> <s> nevertheless the present campaign concentrates upon advertising on the media through packaging and in other ways <e> <s> it is difficult at this stage to quantify the results of only two years work which have just ended <e> <s> nevertheless the apple and pear development council are continuing the scheme and intend to widen it to include more varieties <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that i could advise the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones that that is the case <e> <s> but i regret to say that it is not because output of dessert apples in this country in the last season was thought to be tonnes compared with tonnes in whereas golden delicious apples which take up per cent <e> <s> of all apples marketed in this country amount to approximately tonnes with other varieties as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is right so far as the quality of british apples is concerned <e> <s> so far as her question relating to cherries is concerned i have no figures about the kentish orchards which have been grubbed up <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to advise my noble friend that in the season the value of cherries was no less than million although the figure varies considerably from year to year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that to date we have no figures on the export of cherries or indeed of coxs orange pippins <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that with his long experience at the ministry of agriculture the noble lord will know that my right honourable friend mr walker is well aware of the present situation <e> <s> it is one of the reasons why he put in hand the kingdom scheme in order to enable the marketing of british <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the loss of certain crops and this particularly applies to cherries can be attributed to bird damage <e> <s> nevertheless i think that the figures as to what the precise loss is should be approached with caution <e>", "<cs> my lords yes to the extent that the advertising campaign has shown some improvement and further that the capital grants available for horticulturalists under the agricultural and horticultural grant scheme the agricultural and horticultural development scheme and the agricultural and horticultural co-operation scheme were revised only two years ago and rationalised to assist this very purpose among others <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord he is speaking a second time on report i think <e>", "<cs> my lords a natural break appears to occur at this point

the lord chancellor i beg to introduce a bill to consolidate the insurance companies acts and <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> it would probably be suitable for our deliberations if at this stage i were to respond to the comments of my noble friend lord mottistone and the noble lord lord darling <e> <s> my noble friend referred to the fact that when the bill was being considered in another place the government moved two amendments which would have altered the statutory defences available under the food and drugs act <e> <s> section of that act makes the seller of a defective article liable in law unless he can prove that the contravention was due to the default of another person and has that other person brought before the court <e> <s> that degree of liability on the seller goes considerably further than in other major legislation designed to protect the consumer such as the weights and measures acts to the trade descriptions act or the consumer safety act whose provisions operate satisfactorily <e> <s> the government therefore thought it right to take the opportunity presented by the bill to move those amendments to the food and drugs act which would have made it a defence to prove that due diligence had been exercised to prevent the contravention <e>", "<cs> in response to my noble friend i think that if he reads my reply in <e>", "<cs> i think at this stage it would be appropriate to say that of course i recognise what the noble lord lord darling of hillsborough has said with regard to the arithmetical aspect <e> <s> his arguments are quite strong in that regard <e> <s> while i was attempting to show that a review has taken place to the extent that i have described it was merely to demonstrate that an effort was made between the consideration in another place and the consideration of this matter in your lordships house <e> <s> naturally the government recognise that this is not a full review but it did constitute a real effort carried out with some speed and with the co-operation of those concerned to furnish the ministry with some material on which to base their preliminary examinations <e> <s> i hope that to some extent what i have said will reassure the noble lord lord darling on that point and also my noble friend lord sandford <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend the chief whip announced earlier this afternoon that we would have an intermission at oclock with the agreement of your lordships i beg to move that further consideration of this bill on report be now adjourned until pm <e>", "<cs>

for this amendment and we have already had a full debate on the detention centre order <e> <s> if we are to have the order we must have somewhere to put those sentenced under it <e> <s> this amendment

contributions but perhaps no worse for that <e> <s> your lordships however must be aware that when my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science announced in a written

to this particular matter <e> <s> i am bound to say however that while the government do not regard this issue as entirely closed neither have we been persuaded by the case that has so far been made out for a reduction in the statutory maximum length of probation orders to two years <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house is indebted to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for mentioning this particular subject because it gives me the opportunity of mentioning the progress that has taken place and i think it would be valuable to record it <e> <s> if the intention behind

decided that a probation order for longer than two years is in fact necessary <e> <s> this is a fairly consistent figure over the last three or four years and we believe it would be wrong to deprive

carried forward <e>", "<cs> we have that assurance <e> <s> the same arguments which apply to amendment no <e> <s> apply to this amendment <e> <s> i believe that it would be tedious to rehearse in detail the precise arguments which i related to the committee at that time <e> <s> nevertheless there are a number of matters which i am sure your lordships will be somewhat distressed about particularly the fact that amendment no <e> <s> is not to be discussed before the committee this evening <e> <s> of course when we see the amendment at report stage we shall have only one opportunity to speak individually <e> <s> that stage does not have the great advantage of the committee procedure in your lordships house when as many speeches may be made as are convenient to your lordships <e>", "<cs> i had not anticipated that my noble friend lady trumpington woud say more this evening on the subject of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am most grateful to all noble lords who have spoken at length and very much in support of the general thrust of the amendment <e> <s> i was naturally glad to hear from my noble friend that the government accept that general thrust <e> <s> i was also glad that my noble friend lady gardner supported the amendment and that she did not describe it as a mischievous amendment <e> <s> that was her description of my earlier amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very glad to support this amendment and i should like to quote from an interesting document which will be available to your lordships <e> <s> i am referring to the expenditure committee social services and employment sub-committee minutes of evidence for wednesday th march before which the late lord douglas of barloch who was such an eminent authority in this field appeared <e> <s> he was asked the following question which appears at column and which is numbered question <e> <s> he was asked <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord makes a final decision on his amendment i should like to express my pleasure at hearing lord houghtons speech because he brought forward the fact that he was going to give evidence <e> <s> we have almost repeatedly throughout the committee stage heard from my noble friend lord caithness about the absence of evidence <e> <s> i have been through the record and i discover that he said on th april that there was no evidence at column and that there was no concrete evidence at column and at column we have found no scientific evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very encouraging answer <e> <s> is my noble friend able to say how many aircraft and what aircraft are available to the marine pollution control unit and what other means of pollution dispersal are available to that body <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships greatly appreciate this opportunity which has been afforded us by my noble friend lord chelwood to discuss this whole subject <e> <s> we rarely have such an opportunity and so it is with particular pleasure that i join in this debate <e> <s> in considering the events of the past hours it is perhaps of great significance that more than prisoners mainly palestinians have been exchanged for three israelis <e> <s> this is the second exchange of prisoners within about two and a half years since in november some plo prisoners were exchanged for six israelis <e> <s> i understand that the latest exchange was arranged by direct negotiation between yassir arafat and the authorities in israel <e> <s> surely this is of very great significance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to support this amendment which the noble lord lord charteris of amisfield has so eloquently moved on this particular subject <e> <s> it is very clear that the alternative supply is one which commends itself as the only possibility in the circumstances <e> <s> it is a particular problem to which we have referred throughout our discussions on this bill but in the background there has been the judgment of lord jauncey <e> <s> perhaps i may draw the attention of <e>", "<cs> my lords while listening to my noble friend lord moyne and agreeing with him that the hour is late i feel that there is one matter of substance which all your lordships should recollect that is we are a deliberative chamber <e> <s> this motion will permit your lordships house to deliberate on an issue which while fully recognising every word that the noble baroness has said in regard to the concessions which she has made and consideration given will permit that degree of flexibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself as i have on the amendment with the noble lord lord ennals and i should like to start my remarks by thanking the noble baroness <e> <s> lady trumpington for giving so much time to the redraft of amendment no <e> <s> on committee and now producing it in the form of amendment no <e> <s> on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord monson in this amendment <e> <s> at the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that brief emphatic and helpful reply <e> <s> can he tell the house what controls are available to the government and what other means there are of controlling pests entering this country in timber imports <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is the wish of your lordships house that this amendment be withdrawn i shall certainly withdraw it in a moment but before doing so i should like to say something on the state of research into the subject <e> <s> while i entirely agree with the noble baroness that a very large amount of research has been carried out i understand that there are over different varieties of researches and reports nevertheless there is still a divergence of opinion <e> <s> this divergence is probably best shown in the work that has been done and has been commented on by sir richard doll and of course professor knox of birmingham university on the one hand and that done by dr john emsley of kings college london and many others on the opposite side and i referred to dr cedric wilson this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment because i feel that a review is very necessary <e> <s> i should particularly like to refer to the question that was raised at report stage when i drew the attention of my noble friend lady trumpington to lord jaunceys judgment in regard to the whole aspect of the medicines act and in respect of the supposition which the government make that fluoridation does not fall within section of that act <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support most warmly my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i do so for a particular reason <e> <s> in committee i drew your lordships attention to the situation in the west midlands which was referred to by my noble friend and in particular i mentioned the severn-trent water authority <e> <s> i should like to amplify what my noble friend has said in regard to those who will be disfranchised and that is the important word <e> <s> out of a total of elected councils in the severn-trent region which had debated thought about and ultimately voted upon fluoridation voted against the practice <e> <s> yet their democratically-reached decisions were overruled by the powerful non-elected bodies in those areas <e> <s> indeed out of is a very high proportion of those who were disfranchised and who as i understand it will have no opportunity once again to express their perfectly valid choice and views in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment as indeed i believe that the whole substance of it is extraordinarily similar to an amendment which i moved at committee stage on th april <e> <s> but this is a better more succinctly worded amendment and presented to a different clause <e> <s> the original one was addressed to clause of the bill <e> <s> when your lordships considered the amendment on th april the committee divided those content numbered those not not-content at that time <e> <s> but that gives way to the opportunity on third reading to reconsider this matter <e> <s> i warmly welcome the fact that the noble lord lord ennals has with great ingenuity found a means of doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i feel that our discussions would indeed yield some small fruit if the noble baroness would concede that this is an absolute necessity <e> <s> i would hold it to be self-evident in the discussions we have had and also in the result of the division which took place on the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree with some of the comments of the noble lord lord monson because i do not see this as largely a political debate or a political bill <e> <s> i see it as a bill of great importance arising from the longest case in scottish legal history <e> <s> my feeling is not one of levity but one of sorrow at the end of this because having studied the subject with great concern for over years i reached the exact opposite opinion from that of the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> perhaps i entered at the point at which i was a most enthused opponent of fluoridation and i do not deny that my motivation for studying it had that in mind <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for a very satisfactory answer <e> <s> but does he agree that the establishment of the british kite mark in the minds of the customer both domestic and overseas will need a sustained campaign <e> <s> can he confirm that it is the intention of her majestys government to see that both the domestic and the overseas markets are catered for <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord orr-ewing and with his consent i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> can he tell the house whether a larger proportion of graduates are now going into industry than hitherto <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for a very satisfactory answer <e> <s> perhaps i may ask whether she is aware i am sure she is that science and technology regional organisations exist in this country <e> <s> may i also ask her whether it is possible to obtain funding from the european community to further this aim <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for according me that answer <e> <s> is my noble friend aware of any application which has been made by the church of scientology <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that helpful reply will he agree that the question of efficiency in charging for water services depends on the meter <e> <s> also can he say whether the development and design of water meters lead the government to believe that a new efficiency may be promoted in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that detailed and interesting answer <e> <s> does he agree that the completion of the work on the clock tower has been a most spectacular stage in the work on the palace <e> <s> does he also agree that the work which has continued virtually uninterrupted since the end of the war in is a most notable achievement for everybody concerned architects and craftsmen alike <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for a very encouraging reply <e> <s> can he say whether it is the present intention that there will be a public flotation after or whether this is as at present arranged strictly an employee participation in the shareholding <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed an historic occasion this afternoon as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has said to see once again a gas bill before your lordships house <e> <s> as an amateur in this field it has given me the opportunity to look back on your lordships discussions and indeed on discussions in parliament over the past years on gas bills i understand that there have been nearly of them altogether <e> <s> that incorporates a very large number of private bills and private acts quite apart from the major legislation before us this afternoon <e> <s> perhaps i may be allowed to congratulate my noble friend lord gray of contin on his lucid and comprehensive introduction to this bill a shorter speech by far in minutes than the speech which came from the lips of that great advocate lord jowitt on nd june when he took minutes to introduce the nationalisation of gas on that occasion <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord tell the committee whether he is now addressing the second amendment or the first one <e>", "<cs> i oppose this amendment as do my noble friends on this side of the house for a number of reasons most particularly this is a major philosophical divide between both sides of your lordships committee on the role of this bill <e> <s> the answer to both the noble lords lord ezra and lord diamond is contained in the governments white paper which we have before us cmnd <e> <s> on page paragraph <e> <s> this refers to the contract market <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> this amendment may have certain superficial attractions but there is one fundamental problem <e> <s> in moving it the noble lord lord diamond is seeking to tie the hands of the secretary of state <e> <s> the suggestion is that advice would not be available <e> <s> there is certainly a gratifying suggestion here which is not repeated in any other statute so far as i am aware that consultation should take place with a committee of your lordships house <e> <s> i am not aware of any other statute and perhaps the noble lord can inform the committee on that point <e> <s> i should be delighted to know whether this procedure of consultation with a committee of your lordships house prior to an appointment is in statute law at present <e> <s> if it is not i may be correct <e> <s> however the noble lord is proposing an innovation <e> <s> i suggest that the advice of the secretary of state with which he will be amply supplied will be sufficient without embodying this in a statute <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to support most strongly what my noble friend has said in such a moderate and statesmanlike way may i ask him about what was mentioned in the statement relating to the burden of overtime in particular with regard to average earnings <e> <s> can he comment upon the average earnings of prison officers and on the need for overtime which was mentioned in the statement and which must clearly be one of the particular points involved <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord diamond has demonstrated an endearing solicitude for the director general and has taken us into a number of situations which may or may not have endeared themselves to your lordships <e> <s> but i suggest that we may look at this situation in a totally different light if we regard it in a field which is a long way from this type of appointment <e> <s> i suggest that ecclesiastical law may be a parallel not perhaps a very good parallel but it is a parallel where a bishop through a committee appoints a person <e> <s> he may if he appoints that person to a freehold remove him only on the grounds as stated in the bill of incapacity or misbehaviour <e> <s> the bishop if he wishes to dismiss that particular incumbent has regard to the situation and he will do so only on those very grave grounds <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what my noble friend lady macleod of borve has said <e> <s> she speaks from great experience on this matter <e> <s> perhaps it is not too previous in our discussions to refer to schedule <e> <s> the noble lord lord ezra and some of his noble friends have referred to the problems of the consumer in this regard <e> <s> schedule paragraph may assist him <e> <s> the paragraph states <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very encouraging reply <e> <s> can he assure the house that the document will include profit sharing within the industrial sector and perhaps linked also to other factors <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the message from the table of figures which he has kindly said he will place in the <e>", "<cs> the suggestion was made by the noble lord lord stoddart that this is a reasonable amendment <e> <s> i suggest that this is a very unreasonable one because we are looking at a world energy situation and three of the fuels concerned have a world energy content <e> <s> whether the generation of electricity depends on coal and let us assume that a proportion of it does coal is drawn from markets other than our own domestic market <e> <s> it is drawn from australia poland and many other countries in the world and to suggest that we can be little englanders in this regard is to delude ourselves <e>", "<cs> i do think that my noble friend has gone as far as it is possible to do <e> <s> perhaps it would be a suitable moment to draw the committees attention to the fact that in preparing and examining legislation of this nature the committee have a particular responsibility <e> <s> regarding the stability of the statute book it is a major matter <e> <s> my noble friend attempted and he is quite right to do so to seek that this statute should remain in operation for at least a generation <e> <s> if we think back to the state of the gas industry years ago and look at it in and think of the changes within the industry since that time this is a real reason to have that degree of flexibility <e>", "<cs> my lords are her majestys government aware of and do they appreciate the serious risk that exists for sixth-formers school-leavers and university students who are liable to be recruited into cults <e> <s> is it possible for my noble friend to advise his right honourable friend the home secretary that there is an urgent need for the production of a leaflet to warn teachers and parents of that risk <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lady elliot of harwood and with her permission i beg leave to ask the question standing in her name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very comprehensive answer <e> <s> will he say what schemes are available in the further education sector where projects have been so successful in relation to scotland <e>", "<cs> we have listened to some criticism from the noble lord lord bruce of donington which was not justified had he looked in detail at the proceedings of standing committee f on th march this year that committee gave very detailed consideration to this amendment and in his reply my right honourable friend mr alick buchanan-smith said in referring to this precise point if i may quote it to the committee as it is very relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for that interesting answer can he assure the house that it is still the governments view that the potential of the severns tidal power is as great as any in the world and indeed greater than the project brought to a successful conclusion at la rance in france <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that hydrologists and engineers have been working on this since the first design in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the

that reply and at the same time taking this opportunity of congratulating him on his recent appointment may i ask him in regard to the environmentally sensitive areas whether he could indicate the time scale of progress which is being made in regard to these very important zones <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house whether the governments intention is to extend from the six areas in the inner city initiative to all the eight areas if it were successful in its initiation <e>", "<cs> my lords although i recognise the merits of the governments proposals in saving police manpower can the minister say whether it is intended that membership of the band will entail being a member of equity in the future and will that create problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that interesting announcement <e> <s> following the announcement made by his right honourable friend in november can he say whether this reserve has been developed over a period of years whether there was any indication of this important development and whether there are to be others <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome what my noble friend said about the continuance of planning control and the conservation of the green belt around cities <e> <s> does he agree in view of the very wide interest shown in this statement throughout the house that the subject would be an admirable source of interest for a major debate in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging reply <e> <s> will he inform the house whether the prison governors association is in

noble friend for that very encouraging answer <e> <s> can he comment on whether damages defects and delays are causing slippage in the programme <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend tell the house how the hospital building programme is being funded <e> <s> is it possible for proceeds from local sales within a regional health authority to be credited towards a particular scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the shadowy and nebulous nature of cults will her majestys government consider maintaining so far as possible a register of the cults which are known to the home office in
