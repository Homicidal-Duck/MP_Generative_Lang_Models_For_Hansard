["<cs> my lords i am glad that my first remarks as leader of your lordships house should be to join in the generous tributes which have been paid by the noble lords lord peart and lord gladwyn the noble baroness lady hylton-foster the noble lord lord aylestone and the right reverend prelate the bishop of rochester to my noble friend lord soames <e> <s> in doing so i know i can associate not only my noble friends on the front bench but also those noble lords and baronesses who sit behind me with everything that has been said <e> <s> i assure the house that i shall draw to his attention the tributes which have been paid and particularly the obvious affection with which they have been expressed <e> <s> i know that many of your lordships will have respected as i have those qualities of leadership of friendship and of his obvious enjoyment of life which he has shown to such good effect over the years in what has been a most distinguished and varied career <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make a statement <e> <s> we have all been deeply shocked and distressed to hear of the death of president sadat <e> <s> we have lost a friend whose courage and vision we so greatly admired <e> <s> the assassination of president sadat is a grievous blow to egypt to the middle east and to the cause of peace <e> <s> the egyptian nation has lost a supreme leader whose qualities of boldness and vision were matched by deep understanding of world affairs <e> <s> history will mark his great achievements most notably his imaginative and typically direct bid for peace in his visit to jerusalem in <e> <s> the world is a more dangerous place without him <e> <s> the deep and heartfelt sympathy of her majestys government and this house goes out to mrs sadat his family and his people <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the parliamentary commissioner is there to help members of the house of commons discharge their responsiblities as the elected representatives of their constituents and the act accordingly provides for complaints to be made only through members of the house of commons <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have had a very good run on this and that it would be the wish of the house that we should move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be very helpful to the house if the noble lord would put his remarks in the interrogative form <e>", "<cs> my lords there are about million public service pensioners whose pensions are index-linked by statute <e> <s> the first year cost of the increases due to these pensions on rd november will be about million <e> <s> i am circulating in the <e>", "<cs> my lords while the supplementary question put by the noble baroness which she has suggested i might answer as leader of the house is perhaps a little wide of her question on the order paper i am grateful to her for having given me notice of her intention to raise the point and giving me an opportunity to comment on it <e> <s> the government did arrange for a written question to be answered on monday of this week setting out in <e>", "<cs> my lords we are on the second question that the noble lord lord jenkins has asked <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me very great pleasure for the first time as leader of the house to follow the noble lords lord peart and lord byers and to add my own congratulations to what they have said about the mover and seconder of the humble address <e> <s> i think we all appreciate the significance of the great ceremony of the state opening of parliament and expect to enjoy two excellent speeches at the start of our debate on the address and today we were not disappointed <e> <s> i offer to my noble friends lord bethell and lord fairfax my warmest congratulations <e> <s> i only hope that the thought of their impending fate has not seriously interrupted their enjoyment of the prorogation break in parliamentary affairs or indeed this mornings magnificent ceremony <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first time i have had the privilege of opening a debate on the gracious speech <e> <s> my first very pleasant task is to say how much we look forward to hearing the three maiden speakers in the course of this debate which will take place over two days that is the noble lord lord marsh the noble lord lord constantine of stanmore and the noble lord lord mcfadzean of kelvinside <e> <s> each brings <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it right that before we begin todays business we should pause to associate ourselves with the tributes paid yesterday in another place to the reverend robert bradford <e> <s> i know that noble lords on all benches will join with me in expressing horror and revulsion at the assassination and extend sympathy to mrs bradford to her family to robert bradfords constituents in belfast and to his friends and colleagues in another place <e> <s> perhaps i could also echo the words spoken by my right honourable friend the prime minister later last night when she stressed that reconciliation is the path to peace <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry to interrupt the noble lord but perhaps he would he kind enough to put his remarks in the form of a question <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has been very patient with the noble lord <e> <s> i should be glad if he would ask his question briefly and not put in so many supplementaries <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be good enough please to ask his question and not to make long quotations in the middle of it <e>", "<cs> my lords at the beginning of my remarks i should like to thank my noble friend lord alport for giving us a further opportunity to debate this important matter <e> <s> i am sure the house listened with great interest to the way in which he introduced his bill and the care with which he put his arguments <e> <s> more particularly i thank him because he has enabled me to take part for the first time as leader of your lordships house in a debate touching on the house of lords as a whole and the role it plays in our constitution <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that i listened carefully to what he and other noble lords have said and if what i have to say about the bill from the government front bench is not as encouraging as he would wish this does not mean that we consider the wider constitutional issues raised to be anything but of the most fundamental importance <e> <s> indeed the government have given a good deal of thought to these issues since the bill was debated a year ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would be good enough to ask his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that noble lords in all parts of the house agree that this is a serious matter but i think the noble and learned lord lord wilson appreciates that if he refers to the <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now had nearly seven minutes on this question <e> <s> it was a very wide question and i think there is a danger that it is developing into a debate which your lordships will recall is one of the things which the procedure committee felt should not happen and i would suggest that we ought to move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords we have spent nearly nine minutes on this question <e> <s> i suggest that after we have heard the noble lord lord paget it will be time to move on to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a statement and the noble lord lord kennet is putting a series of questions <e> <s> perhaps he will make this his final question on the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now had eight minutes on this question and i really think that it is time to move on to the next one <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord lord spens be good enough to put his question <e>", "<cs> my lords as the law stands civil service and other public service pensions can be forfeited only if a person is convicted of treason of serious offences under the official secrets acts or of offences in connection with their employment which a minister has certified to have been gravely injurious to the state or to be liable to lead to serious loss of confidence in the public service <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord beswick for providing the opportunity to debate this wide and thought-provoking motion <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady macleod has been trying to get in for some time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have had now a very long time on these questions and that it is the feeling of the house as we have important business to deal with that we should move to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now spent nine minutes on this first question and i think it is the wish of the house that we should move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me as leader of the house to say when a group can call itself a political group <e> <s> with respect the noble lords question is a hypothetical one but i am delighted though in no way surprised to hear that the noble lord is considering forming his own party in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> it is very important that the noble lord lord wade should make his points but we are on the committee stage of the bill and i would ask him to direct his points to the particular amendment that we are debating which is the one that has been moved by the noble viscount lord eccles <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole question of the framing of questions for the order paper is i think governed by the wording of questions and motions as set out in the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my sad duty as leader of the house to pay tribute to the noble lord lord butler of saffron walden who as the house will know died on monday <e> <s> it is fitting that a tribute will also be paid this afternoon in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister because the noble lords greatest public achievements took place between and during which time he was a most distinguished member of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords it is estimated that non-industrial civil servants are engaged full-time as union representatives on industrial relations duties and trade union activities <e> <s> a further spend more than half of their time in these ways and some less than half <e> <s> the current annual cost of the paid time-off arrangements is estimated at million <e> <s> these arrangements are part of the national whitley council agreement on facilities for non-industrial union representatives <e> <s> as the result of a review of the operation of that agreement it is currently being renegotiated with the unions concerned to provide improved control among other things <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house would wish to have questions from both noble lords who are at present standing <e> <s> perhaps we could have the question from the noble lord lord paget and then the question from the noble viscount lord st davids <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained to the house last december the government will continue to search for changes in the house of lords which would be widely acceptable to the parties <e> <s> but such changes can only proceed on the basis of all-party talks which in turn must depend upon some measure of agreement on the type of reform which might take place <e> <s> at present there is no sign of this agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is making a very long speech and i think that he would agree that it is a speech that was really suitable to second reading rather than a speech which is appropriate to third reading which is the stage of the bill that we have now reached <e> <s> i think it is unfortunate that the noble earl was not in his place to speak at second reading and i hope he will accept that there was agreement in the house as to the procedure to be adopted at the committee stage <e> <s> i think that it would be unfortunate now to raise criticisms of the arrangements that were made at that stage <e> <s> i think that it would be the wish of the house if the noble earl could confine his remarks to those appropriate to a third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the house will allow me to say a brief word about our rather unusual business today <e> <s> i understand that in another place it is intended that their debate should be limited to three hours <e> <s> without in any way wishing to curtail speeches or to prevent noble lords from speaking i think it would be generally desirable if we could keep the debate on the motion of my noble friend lord carrington to within approximately the same limits as another place <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will in our usual way exercise restraint along these lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord peart and all other noble lords who have paid tribute this afternoon to my noble friend lord carrington <e> <s> as noble lords have said this is not an appropriate moment to dwell on the immediate issues concerning his resignation but i have been deeply moved at the real sense of expression of the great loss of my noble friend who will be greatly missed in all parts of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord brockway has been trying to get in for a very long time <e> <s> may i suggest to the house that we take his supplementary question and then move on to the next question <e>"]
