government support the suggestion that they might encourage their own agencies the nationalised industries and commerce and industry as a whole to adopt a positive attitude towards recruitment into the territorial army <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a privilege for me to have had this chance to initiate a debate on the reserves <e> <s> all that remains is for me to thank very much all the noble lords who have taken part in it and have contributed so much towards it <e> <s> the debate has highlighted some areas where there are strengths and others with weaknesses <e> <s> nevertheless

been placed in me <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply but can he say to what extent it is intended <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that so far as i know there is generally no means of intercommunication between the guard and the driver on any of the older trains

should like to confine my remarks exclusively to the commercial use of helicopters which play an increasingly significant and important part in aviation in this country and indeed throughout the world <e> <s> the subject was last discussed in your lordships house almost exactly three years ago <e> <s> there have been some impressive developments since then to which it is right to draw attention <e> <s> here not for the first time i must declare an interest <e> <s> as many of your lordships know i fly helicopters for british airways specifically on the north sea <e>", "<cs> that was in the fairly early days of helicopter operations my lords when they were not so economically viable as they have become <e> <s> i entirely support the noble earls view and should be delighted to see an operation between north and south wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo the views expressed by other noble lords who have stressed the importance and relevance of the motion standing in the name of my noble friend lord orr-ewing <e> <s> first of all i want to concentrate on the adequacy now and in the future of our air defence radar network <e> <s> this network in conjunction with that of our allies in europe and in scandinavia is the basis for identification of targets and the direction of fighters to counter them <e> <s> there are of course obvious physical problems caused by the curvature of the earths surface which limits the effective range of radar and its ability to detect targets below a certain height <e> <s> that is why it is necessary to use airborne early warning radar presently in the ageing shackleton aircraft using fairly old and unsophisticated equipment but which in the mid-eighties is to be replaced by the airborne early warning nimrod <e> <s> this will enable us to detect aircraft at these greater ranges particularly when they are flying low below the surface-based radar horizon <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the importance of seat belts to children in the back of cars can my noble friend say whether there are any plans on his part to organise the compulsory fitting of seat belts belts which are adjustable for children in the back of cars <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that helicopters of the queens flight are unable to fly when icing conditions are present that is to say when it is raining or in cloud when the temperature drops below plus and that that imposes severe constraints on the operation of these helicopters in the winter time <e> <s> would he also bear in mind that now westland are developing the first all-british helicopter for some years there may well be opportunities here to replace the old wessexes with the wg <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is the case that this accident might have been due to a cargo door becoming dislodged at the rear of the aircraft and getting stuck in the tailplane can my noble friend say how many such cases might have occurred in the past <e> <s> can he also say whether the civil aviation authority have recommended any modifications and whether indeed any of these modifications have been mandatory modifications <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the british airports authority estimate that the number of passengers using gatwick will increase from million in to million that is at present capacity by that this could grow to million if the second terminal is approved by and that freight tonnage could increase from tonnes to tonnes by <e> <s> would he therefore not agree that it is an essential part of airport planning in the south-east that road access to gatwick be kept in line with what already exists for heathrow and is planned for stansted <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord spens for providing the opportunity to discuss employment in this way this evening <e> <s> charges are sometimes made against the government that they are uncaring in their attitude towards the number of unemployed <e> <s> it seems only too clear and logical to me however and i am sure to others in your lordships house that there can be little validity whatever in this view <e> <s> in national economic and even party terms it is of course tragic to have unemployment on the scale which sadly exists today unless as is the case it is the temporary unfortunate side effect of a policy that is designed ultimately to increase industrial output improve competitiveness in world markets stimulate more orders and lead to the expansion that is necessary to achieve them and hence to more jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the deer scotland act and certain related enactments <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> when i first became involved with this bill it did not take me long <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is a point that will be amply covered later on <e> <s> there are differences between scotland and england <e> <s> i think the noble lord will become fully aware later on that they are not entirely the same in some respects close and perhaps in others slightly wider apart <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard a great deal this afternoon in more than three and a half hours on the subject of deer and though i must say i have heard a great many of the points raised before while we have been discussing this bill i still feel i have learned a lot from what has been said in your lordships house this afternoon <e> <s> of course when i read the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble viscount for his comments supporting the bill <e> <s> these amendments would prevent a very modest extension of the remit of the red deer commission which is provided for in the bill <e> <s> of course the commission is and will remain primarily concerned with red deer but it came out clearly in the consultative process which preceded the framing of the bill that it would be helpful if the commission could play an appropriate role in regard not only to sika but to other species <e> <s> in going about their work as i explained on second reading the red deer commission do not and cannot ignore other species which they encounter <e> <s> it is more than just accident therefore that they acquire some knowledge of the habits and distribution of these other species <e> <s> it seems only right that the knowledge which is acquired by a public body such as this should be tapped for public benefit <e>", "<cs> i understand my noble friends point but the powers that this particular clause and the other two that he mentioned deal with are purely advisory <e> <s> they do not bring in control <e> <s> the effect of clause and clause is to extend the range of the red deer commissions powers and functions from red to sika <e> <s> that which applies to other species is only advisory <e> <s> that is quite plain in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to say that we acknowledge the fact that the second nippon should not be in place although it appears in the act and in the deer close seasons scotland order it denotes only one of a dozen or so sub-species of sika deer <e> <s> we are happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend seeks to ask for expansion of what practical means <e> <s> there is nothing new in these words <e> <s> the act in section <e>", "<cs> i see the purpose of the amendment but i do not think an amendment is necessary here nor do i think that the amendment as drafted would achieve its purpose <e> <s> in practice the red deer commission take a broad view of their duties of advising landowners particularly in their encouragement of deer management groups <e> <s> as yet nobody has seriously challenged their power to do so so they are able to operate satisfactorily under the existing act <e>", "<cs> i entirely sympathise with the views expressed by noble lords who feel that knowledge of what deer are killed by tenant farmers is just as much part of the management scene of deer as what the proprietors of the deer forest shoot themselves <e> <s> this particular amendment would not achieve the desired effect <e> <s> the commission gathers returns under section for their own purposes and they have not found it necessary to go to the smaller type of occupier at whom the amendment seems to be aimed despite the discrepancy to which my noble friend lord burton referred of out of <e> <s> nor would it be practical for them to do so <e> <s> they would be in the business of chasing up returns from probably several thousand occupiers <e> <s> they simply are not staffed for that kind of work <e>", "<cs> as i said the amendment i have tabled comes later in the bill <e> <s> i accept the noble lords point but the effect of the amendment as it is written would be to oblige the red deer commission to send to the owner of the land any returns of deer killed that they may have acquired from the occupier of the land <e> <s> there is no way that this could be achieved without the red deer commission being involved <e> <s> i hope that when the noble lord looks later in the marshalled list he will find that my amendment meets this case <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord thurso is quite right when he says that the effect of the suggested clause a as put forward by the noble viscount lord massereene would be seriously to diminish the rights of occupiers which they have held for a very long time <e> <s> it would prohibit any tenant from killing deer on his land until he had given the landlord or the red deer commission hours notice <e> <s> first there is a technical defect in the amendment in that subsection does not make clear what would be the effect on an owner-occupier <e> <s> possibly he can be deemed to notify himself though if that be the case it would appear that having done so he would have to wait hours before doing anything about it <e> <s> or it might he that he would be obliged to give notice to the commission but in that case i cannot imagine what action the commission might take on the information <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to know that the noble lord lord northfield has spent hours thumbing through dictionaries <e> <s> i can assure him that i have <e> <s> i have spent more time during the last few weeks discussing the relative merits of substantial and serious than upon almost anything else <e> <s> i accept that damage needs to be qualified in some way and the choice is between substantial and serious <e> <s> as the noble lord said the word serious has been creeping in for very good reasons over the years <e> <s> i am very happy that the word serious should be substituted for substantial and therefore i shall accept both this amendment and the related amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> the proposed amendment would restrict the red deer commissions power to deal with marauding deer to enclosed land <e> <s> whatever may be its intent the effect of the amendment would be to nullify the commissions principal deer control power under section of the act <e> <s> what it proposes is nothing less than the removal of the main legal power to deal with marauding deer on unenclosed land <e> <s> i do not think i should be putting it too strongly if i said that the effect of the amendment would be to make not just my bill but the act itself virtually unworkable <e> <s> there are specific legal powers to deal with deer on enclosed land elsewhere in the act that is under section <e> <s> section of the act is designed for deer control on deer range generally that is on unenclosed land <e> <s> if the powers of section were not available i can only suppose that the commission would have to fall back on much more sweeping powers such as those which are available to them under section of the act which means the imposition of control schemes <e> <s> that is a reserve power which has rarely if ever been used <e> <s> i think my noble friend would agree that it would be much better if it were to stay that way and were not to be used <e>", "<cs> there are other amendments down which relate to clause and we shall be discussing them in due course <e> <s> it is possible that there will be further improvements to that clause <e> <s> as to the question of deer on hill land generally there is a need for the red deer commission to have a controlling power on unenclosed land <e> <s> we heard from my noble friend what the definition of enclosed land might be but section as it stands works very well and there is quite a lot of doubt as to whether or not section would be really effective in the way that he described the red deer commission putting it into effect <e> <s> i hope that the noble viscount will see fit to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> lord northfield that section of the act as these amendments detail will result in fairly arduous reading <e> <s> the amendment of the noble lord lord northfield would remove from the categories of damage for which the red deer commission may employ their control powers competition by deer with farm animals for food and damage to agricultural production <e> <s> i accept that there may be some in-precision in the term competing with them for food and i hope to deal with this point in a moment when another amendment is moved by my noble friend lord dulverton <e> <s> but there is some real point in lines and in that damage done to agriculture by deer can go beyond the destruction of crops and pasture <e> <s> for example it can extend to the impoverishment of pasture which can be evidenced perhaps by poorer lambing <e>", "<cs> i agree and i said just now that yes there is a lot of complexity and perhaps unecessary complication in the wording of this section <e> <s> i hope that i can explain a little further when we come to my noble friend lord dulvertons amendment <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord northfield will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly happy for the two amendments to be taken together and so perhaps my noble friend lord dulverton would like to speak to his amendment as well <e>", "<cs> there is merit in both amendments <e> <s> i agree entirely that the wording here is very convoluted indeed <e> <s> i also think lord dulvertons amendment to specify rather more accurately over-grazing of pastures and competing with farm animals for supplementary feeding is a very good form of words <e> <s> we have to try to define as precisely as possible the circumstances in which the commission may legitimately intervene <e> <s> i would like to take both amendments away and look at the situation again and put something down on report <e>", "<cs> the whole question of owners is something which we discussed previously and will come back to again <e> <s> but new section a of the bill is in a sense complementary to section of the act <e> <s> it is designed to come into play in conditions where the commissions staff already in the field are operating under section <e> <s> i believe therefore that on reflection and in the light of the amendment that we have seen the terms of new section a should be made as similar as appropriate to the existing section <e> <s> my noble friends amendment in fact goes some way in that direction <e> <s> it would qualify damage as substantial although we have now agreed to call it serious <e> <s> it requires that damage should actually be occurring rather than merely likely to occur and it makes some reference to the interests of the owner albeit not in the same terms as are found in section <e> <s> if my noble friend would agree to withdraw his amendment i would be happy to take the matter away reconsider it and perhaps draft another amendment in the light of those considerations <e>", "<cs> i understand what the noble lord is saying but in point of fact the owner will be aware under section that the red deer commission are there anyway <e> <s> i do not think that one can cast aspersions at the red deer commission in that way <e> <s> i hope that that satisfies the noble lord <e>", "<cs> we shall be coming to clause in due course which deals in detail with the whole question of night shooting <e> <s> therefore perhaps we could leave the matter until then <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord northfield has made some very valid points about the provisions in the bill which seek to curb poaching <e> <s> i look forward to the amendments which he proposes to move later in the bills passage to tighten up these provisions still further where possible but there are defects in this amendment <e> <s> i think the point which was picked up by my noble friend lord dulverton about the projection of missiles is certainly a point which redounds to some extent on his argument <e> <s> it is already an offence to shoot with anything other than a firearm in any case but darting is something which is occasionally required <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble viscount lord thurso for his suggestion and yes i think there is merit in what he says and that we ought to take it away and look at it again <e> <s> this i will undertake to do <e> <s> before i sit down perhaps i may refer briefly to what was said by my noble friend lord dulverton <e> <s> i have done many things with helicopters myself but i am ashamed to say that one thing i have not done is anything in the way of driving deer or even taking a census of deer from the air <e> <s> but my noble friend makes a good point <e> <s> he makes a point which i have made here on more than one occasion which is to try to enhance for everybodys benefit the versatility of helicopters <e> <s> he makes a good point and i am happy to take the amendment away and to look at it again <e>", "<cs> it was the noble lord lord northfield who used the word epidemic <e> <s> it was not my word <e>", "<cs> we ought to be wary of the argument that if it is to be used by poachers it should be banned which i think is the broad thrust of the noble lords argument <e> <s> to take the argument to its logical conclusion we should not then kill any deer <e> <s> there is another point of view that if one is going to shoot in the dark this comes into the bill later though my noble friend is talking about it now it is best that at least the most efficient method possible should be used <e> <s> this could include light-intensifying image-intensifying sights <e> <s> if my noble friend would agree to withdraw his amendment at this point we should be prepared to take it away obtain advice on it and come back to it later <e>", "<cs> i accept it <e>", "<cs> i think that i am at one with lord northfields intention in his amendment <e> <s> however i believe that it can be achieved by a shorter amendment <e> <s> additionally my amendment picks up the consequential point that just as an offence against clause attracts stiffer penalties under clause where two or more persons are involved in acting together the same possibility should be open for offences against the new section a <e> <s> therefore i hope that he will withdraw his amendment and perhaps we could then accept mine <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might deal with parts of this amendment separately <e> <s> paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i suggest that we have reached a convenient point at which to stop and accordingly i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the whole question of the procedure by which the councils are to deal with applications is one which is going to require comprehensive provision <e> <s> it involves not only the matter of whom the council is to consult but how they are to deal with objections lodged by those consulted whether to give the application a hearing what right of appeal an applicant is to have against refusal of his application and so on <e> <s> i shall have a little more to say about this when we come to another amendment which i have tabled no <e> <s> which proposes that all these matters should be dealt with by order <e>", "<cs> i should have referred to amendment no <e> <s> just now and not to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am asking the noble viscount to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is any need for me to add to what the noble lord lord northfield has said in regard to the amendment and i am perfectly happy to accept it <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can add usefully to what the noble duke the duke of atholl has just said <e> <s> i see that to some extent there might well be a point on the question of the type of animal <e> <s> but certainly as it stands the red deer commission is happy with the suggestion <e> <s> i should like to leave it as it is but if the noble viscount on my right feels very strongly that we ought to include something further <e>", "<cs> to some extent the amendment makes the same point as the noble lord lord northfield advanced in the case of earlier amendments nos <e> <s> and which were accepted <e> <s> i am perfectly happy to accept this one <e>", "<cs> i quite accept that it is reasonable that a convicted poacher might stand to forfeit his right to hold a venison dealers licence but it seems to me to be fairly arbitrary to extend the same penalty to shooting out of season <e> <s> i argued on an earlier amendment last week that the bill draws a clear and careful distinction between close season shooting and other offences <e> <s> of course a poacher may go about poaching out of season they nearly all do but then he is committing a double offence anyway <e>", "<cs> i really have nothing to add <e> <s> all i can say is that per cent <e> <s> of the culls turn out to be knobbers whether or not carried out by competent stalkers or whatever <e>", "<cs> i am delighted that the noble lord finds this as complicated as i do <e> <s> i think he makes valid points with these amendments but i suspect that they might leave out too much <e> <s> the expression packed canned or processed for sale which amendment no <e> <s> would delete from the bill is a case in point <e> <s> we do not want to oblige every retail butcher or supermarket branch to get a deer licence <e> <s> it should be sufficient at some point in the chain between the beast being shot and the meat arriving on the dinner table that it should have passed through the hands of at least one licensed dealer <e> <s> if that principle is acceptable i should like the opportunity to give the whole question of the wording of this part further thought and bring back an amendment at the next stage <e>", "<cs> i entirely accept the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is a great deal to choose between the noble lords amendment no <e> <s> and the original text <e> <s> the one point of substance that seems worth taking further time over is whether you allow other persons normally resident as the bill has it or a member of the occupiers household normally resident <e> <s> the latter really limits one to someone living under the same roof and for instance precludes the occupiers brother if the latter happens to live in a separate house on the estate <e> <s> on that basis i think that the bill is more realistic <e>", "<cs> if i may add to what the noble lord lord ross of marnock has said he has made the point that although there has been some restriction he feels that the scope might be widened in due course <e> <s> but the point is that until now the occupier could authorise absolutely anybody at all <e> <s> it is worth making the point that this power is now going to be very seriously restricted <e> <s> my amendments nos <e> <s> and only try to make the whole procedure more practical by allowing somebody who is more efficient to undertake the task <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock has also made that point very well <e> <s> nevertheless i thought it was worth adding that fact <e>", "<cs> i think i can comfort the noble viscount by saying that i feel fairly confident that the red deer commission will approve of him as a fit and competent person for the purpose of shooting deer on his brother-in-laws property <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i was expecting my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard to move his earlier amendment <e> <s> this amendment from my noble friend lord burton would have very much the same effect and is open to the same objections because it puts an unacceptable restriction on the rights of occupiers which we have discussed at length <e> <s> accordingly i am unable to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> this position has been the case since under the agriculture scotland act <e> <s> my noble friend knows as well as i do that it has been <e>", "<cs> the parts of clause to which the noble lord lord northfield refers are not quite the same <e> <s> the effect of his amendment would to some extent be to make a nonsense of the particular passage to which it refers <e> <s> it would literally authorise an occupier among other things to sell any deer on his land to dispose of carcases on his land and so on <e> <s> the sentence as a whole can still be qualified by the proviso by damage if it were decided to do that <e> <s> i think the noble lord might accept that curious things do happen to the grammar if we remove the word in this context <e> <s> it does not necessarily apply in the same way on the other page <e> <s> i would advise the noble lord to leave well alone <e> <s> it has been looked at in depth by the draftsman <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will do that on purely grammatical grounds if nothing else <e>", "<cs> as it stands the law in scotland does not require an occupier to show that damage has been caused by deer the noble lord lord northfield was quite right when he made that point <e> <s> again as the noble lord said an occupier does not even have to satisfy himself or a court that any damage has been caused <e> <s> it is sufficient that there are deer on the land for him to shoot them <e> <s> this is not an accident nor is it a mere hangover from less enlightened days <e> <s> the law was framed quite deliberately for sound practical reasons <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might come back to the noble lord lord northfield on some of the points he has made <e> <s> i think it is clear to him and to the committee at large i do not know how many times we have said it before that this bill is a compromise between all the various aspects that have been looked at <e> <s> i have said it once and i will repeat one hundred times that it is a compromise <e> <s> people have been consulted including all those who are likely to be affected by the measure the noble lord suggests in his amendment <e> <s> we have argued this not only here but in nearly every building in london and edinburgh <e>", "<cs> i cannot speak for my noble friend on the front bench at any length about why it has not been possible for the government to take the bill themselves <e> <s> i have the bill and i shall do my best to deal with it <e> <s> i have told the noble lord that there may well be qualifications which it might be possible to introduce from the point of view of his amendment <e> <s> i told him that while i could not retract the general argument i put in relation to the amendment there might be qualifications which we could possibly take into account and i said i would do that <e> <s> nevertheless i return to what i said earlier namely that if the bill goes to another place and for whatever reason is killed notwithstanding any efforts to bring another bill forward in a few years time or every year for goodness knows how many years we should still end up with the act which would not have been improved either way and on that basis i hope the noble lord will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we have already talked at length about the political effect of an amendment and my noble friend lord glenkinglas referred to it just now <e> <s> but i should like to talk about the practical effect of his amendment <e> <s> the options which would be open to the occupier who sees deer on his land at night are to leave them until dawn to shoot those that he can then and to cast around to see what compensation he may claim from his neighbour or he may apply to the red deer commission which has a legal right to shoot at night and will if your lordships allow the new subsection a to stand have the power to authorise others to do so <e> <s> or he may take the law into his own hands and do away with the deer regardless <e> <s> i think i need hardly say that each option is thoroughly unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> if i may interrupt the noble lord very briefly i should like to say that we are not making night shooting legal night shooting is legal already and i should have thought that that was perfectly plain from the discussion we have had in the past <e>", "<cs> but we are not enshrining it in any different way than it has been enshrined for many years in the past <e>", "<cs> the strength of feeling over the night shooting of roe deer or any other deer for that matter is very evident <e> <s> the subject will arise on other amendments in due course <e> <s> the effect of the two amendments which have been spoken to by the noble lord lord northfield and the noble viscount lord thurso would prevent occupiers from shooting deer other than red deer or sika deer as well according to my noble friend lord burton <e> <s> i accept that most of the marauding against which the occupiers night shooting powers are necessary is done by red deer <e> <s> but i am informed that damage done by roe deer to forest nurseries and in a limited way to market gardens can be serious <e> <s> over the past two or three weeks i myself have seen the damage being done by roe deer to crops adjacent to woodland <e> <s> in these situations only the occupier who is close at hand can control the damage by taking the prompt action which we have talked about so often <e> <s> the occupier needs all the help he can get on such occasions to deal with the problem <e> <s> the occupier can shoot by day but that is of not much use during the short winter days the converse of the noble viscounts argument about the long summer nights in wick especially if the roe confine their activities to the hours of darkness which we all know they do <e>", "<cs> we will come back to the whole question of night shooting <e> <s> yes i will talk to experts about it <e> <s> but we are really trespassing on ground which will be covered under subsection a <e> <s> i think the main point of that if i can put it to the noble lord now is that nobody is suggesting that night shooting is going to be a generally used weapon <e> <s> there are going to be various constraints on the whole performance and what we are saying is that it ought to be available as a last resort <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may come back to the noble lord lord northfield <e> <s> he is not quite right about what i said <e> <s> i apologise if i have misled the noble lord or was not clear in what i said <e> <s> i think that it might be best if we were to take this matter away again and look at it in the way in which i suggested when i spoke to the amendment earlier and see whether or not there is scope for further consideration about the interrelation between subsections and a <e> <s> that is what i am asking the noble lord to do <e> <s> therefore i hope on this occasion he will withdraw the amendment so that we can look at it and come back on report <e>", "<cs> i think that we have already debated the principles of this amendment <e> <s> i accept that where night shooting is concerned it is appropriate that there should be some qualification of the occupiers right to shoot and there is in fact such qualification in the bill <e> <s> the occupier has to satisfy himself that his action is necessary to prevent damage <e> <s> but there is a difference between satisfying himself that something is necessary and having to address his mind to the possible need to prove to a court that as a matter of objective fact it is necessary <e> <s> the latter is what the noble lords amendment implies and as i said we did discuss it before and it puts quite an unfair constraint on an occupiers freedom of action <e> <s> therefore i must advise your lordships not to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes the wording is very similar and i think that we can discuss it <e> <s> on that basis i invite the noble lord to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should expect that a body such as the red deer commission would always give authorisations in written form as a matter of good administrative practice <e> <s> but if the noble lord thinks that this ought to be confirmed in statute i see no reason at all to deny him that and i am happy to accept his amendment <e>", "<cs> i have nothing to add to what my noble friend on the front bench has said <e> <s> yes i am happy to take away the point and look at it again <e> <s> with that i hope the noble lord will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am quite content to accept these amendments which express accurately what we intend will be the practice namely that authorisations will be issued direct to a named individual <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend lord burton is really referring to what we discussed earlier under subsection but we are in fact dealing with an amendment which relates to subsection a <e> <s> i entirely accept that one of the conditions of an authorisation issued by the red deer commission should be that the police are informed of what is to take place <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that that would be the case in practice and would certainly feature in any code of practice published by the red deer commission <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord northfield and i are clearly thinking along very similar lines in these amendments if i may both answer his and speak to my own no <e> <s> <e> <s> his thinking has focused on one aspect and mine on another <e> <s> he had it in mind that the code would as it were be for the self-discipline of the commission to ensure that perhaps they do not issue authorisations except in defined types of circumstances as regards damage or other control measures and so forth and his amendment goes on also in essence to suggest that there should be a code actually to describe the way that the shooting is carried out <e> <s> in tabling my own amendment i more or less left the earlier aspect out and concentrated purely on how the shooting was to be carried out <e>", "<cs> we are concerned purely with the provision of information by one private individual to another <e> <s> that is why my amendment does not provide for enforcement through the criminal law <e> <s> this is a business which is rather more for civil than criminal law <e> <s> if in an extreme case an owner had <e>", "<cs> i do not think we ought to get bogged down in another

procedures for the issue and surrender of venison dealers licences <e> <s> as i said in moving an earlier amendment the schedule leaves untouched a number of matters of equal importance and when we dealt with that amendment the committee agreed that all those matters may be dealt with in due course by regulation <e> <s> that was on the understanding that the regulations were to follow the provisions to be made in the civic government scotland bill <e> <s> therefore it follows that schedule is unnecessary and i should like it to be removed from the bill <e> <s> that is strictly consequential on amendment no <e> <s> since that amendment removed the reference to the schedule from the body of the bill <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i always enjoy listening to the noble viscounts stories about mull <e> <s> but all these three amendments add conditions for forfeiture of things which are used or are capable of being used in <e>", "<cs> i cannot give the noble lord an answer to that but under the terms of the bill they would he capable of being confiscated <e>", "<cs> i do not want the noble lord lord ross to go over what he has just said but i understand that this is covered <e> <s> page of the bill states that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his kind remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be helpful if i reminded the house of the general circumstances in which action under section a will take place <e> <s> the commission will have come in under the existing section to deal with a red deer problem <e> <s> they then find that among the red deer or sikas as it will now be there are also pockets of roe or some other deer which are also causing some damage <e> <s> but they need the power which section a will give them if they are lawfully to shoot deer of these other species <e>", "<cs> my lords the red deer commission stalkers already have a dispensation under section of the act which was amended by the act to shoot at night when they are operating under section of the act or under a control scheme <e> <s> section however and the control scheme provisions which are found in section and following apply only to red deer or as it will be under this bill red and sika <e> <s> thus section confers no exemption in respect of other species and the special exemption for night shooting under section a which is clause of my bill is therefore required if it is intended that section a should operate in parallel with section <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord mansfield said earlier a court would probably be able to deal with a case of wilful injury in an attempt to kill as section of the act makes clear <e> <s> however i accept to put the matter beyond doubt that to deal with any cases that might arise this amendment should be made <e> <s> accordingly i accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all may i say that i am very grateful to the noble lord lord northfield for removing the detail to do with shooting from vehicles which was in his original amendment <e> <s> referring to this amendment it certainly has points of interest and some merit in certain places <e> <s> i start with paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i will come on to amendment no <e> <s> in a moment but the point about other equipment which is mentioned there is that it is a very wide device indeed and in my view and in the view of others who have given advice it could accommodate the use of helicopters which the noble lord has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite happy to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords a philosopher could probably tell us whether there was any difference between a reason to believe and a reasonable ground <e>", "<cs> i am not really convinced that this amendment to the amendment is necessary my lords <e> <s> an occupier cannot lawfully act unless he has good reason to believe that damage will follow in some form or other <e> <s> i would go so far as to say that a good reason is a good reason and that should be sufficient <e> <s> in any case there seems to be some repetition in what the amendment would achieve <e> <s> the deer found so to speak will in fact be the same species as the noble lord will see if he looks at the provision to which it refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that we should have a separate interpretation clause which would give the latin names of these species as is done elsewhere for another part of the bill and that the place for hybrids is in such a clause <e> <s> the noble lord has down a later amendment on this point for which this is a paving amendment <e> <s> i am quite content to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right in what he said earlier as well that we ought to define the species by their latin names <e> <s> i accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that the use of flight simulators has contributed significantly to our flight safety over recent years <e> <s> does he not agree that the united kingdom has been pre-eminent in the development of flight simulation

lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> in doing so i think it might be appropriate if i were to say a few words before the bill leaves your lordships house albeit i think temporarily <e> <s> perhaps i ought to start by stating the obvious in some respects by saying that like many similar bills on wildlife this one has generated a considerable amount of discussion both in your lordships house and outside it <e> <s> any -page bill which has amendments at committee and a further at report plus of course the two we should have had this afternoon at third reading is bound to attract attention and to raise eyebrows a little not least i fear among those who manage our business here particularly my noble friend the chief whip who has i know been a little concerned about the bills progress but certainly more than tolerant <e>", "<cs> i think your lordships would agree that it might now be appropriate for the statement to be repeated <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords in her majestys customs and excise seized kilograms of heroin worth an estimated at street prices in kilograms worth an estimated were seized and in the current year up until th june seizures amounted to kilograms worth an estimated <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i thank the noble lord for his kind remarks <e> <s> so far as heroin is concerned yes it is entirely true that it is a very menacing situation <e> <s> but perhaps it is also true to say that although a very large increase in heroin seizures has taken place over the last year that does to some extent reflect the success which her majestys customs and excise have achieved in actually picking it up <e> <s> it is difficult to say whether only per cent <e> <s> of the total amount of heroin coming into the country is being intercepted <e>", "<cs> my lords the indian sub-continent has emerged as a new and major source of illicit heroin destined for the united kingdom <e> <s> in well over per cent <e> <s> of the heroin seized here originated from this area <e> <s> that represents a considerable increase over previous years and this trend has continued in <e> <s> as regards where it is going it is going all over europe and other countries in europe have had considerable success in parallel with our own people in picking it up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that there is a considerable tie-up between our own customs and excise and similar authorities abroad and that they are perfectly satisfied with the amount of information that they are getting <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot answer that question without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords heroin which is seized is destroyed by burning <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to what the noble lord lord bruce had to say about his amendment <e> <s> i do not think that there would be any point in my going over the background to the bill which has been discussed before <e> <s> nor can i comment usefully upon the many orders which he cited as examples of perhaps time-wasting discussion which has to be held on them in the future because i have no special knowledge of them <e> <s> but i do have one personal piece of knowledge about a bill in which we rejected a piece of legislation in this way and that was in the deer bill which the noble lord may remember took a certain amount of time earlier this year <e>", "<cs> my lords the leaflet to which my noble friend refers concerns the vat treatment of disposals of antiques works of art and other contents of stately homes <e> <s> the leaflet is issued for the guidance of those involved in such disposals who are not familiar with the rules on vat <e> <s> the guidance set out in the leaflet does not represent any change in the law or any change in the interpretation of the law on the part of hm customs and excise <e> <s> it does not indicate a new imposition of vat <e> <s> it would therefore be inappropriate to withdraw the leaflet <e> <s> however discussions on the detailed application of the law in this area are continuing <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is not entirely correct when he says that vat has not been charged <e> <s> certainly consultations about whether vat would be applicable in certain cases have taken place <e> <s> the case arose initially because of an inquiry which concerned the chatsworth house trust and in fact the case in point was not liable for vat <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no reason to suppose that the charging of vat on works of art or antiques in the united kingdom necessarily encourages exports from the point of veiw of the vendor he receives the same amount of money whether the work of art is exported or sold to a united kingdom customer <e> <s> although he has to charge tax to the united kingdom purchaser this accrues to the exchequer <e> <s> from the point of view of the purchaser if he is a registered taxable person he will be able to reclaim the vat anyway <e> <s> an overseas purchaser will normally have to pay vat or some other form of taxation in the country to which the goods are exported and will generally have to bear greater transport and insurance costs than a united kingdom customer <e> <s> it is not therefore the case that the overall cost of acquiring a work of art in this country is necessarily lower for an overseas buyer than for a united kingdom resident <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fully aware of the views that have been expressed in your lordships house about the matter <e> <s> it is something that concerns many people <e> <s> it is also something that very much concerns the treasury and they are very much aware of it <e> <s> to some extent i think that what i said in my original answer that my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer is still continuing to discuss these matters makes the point <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that he will take very careful note of all the views that have been expressed this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that vat is chargeable only on works of art which are displayed <e> <s> there will of course be cases in which people who have these works of art want to dispose of them and there is discussion going on at the moment as to whether or not an appropriate way can be found by which those works of art can be removed from public view for a period of time and then be sold in the normal way without attracting vat liability <e> <s> but again i can only tell my noble friend that this is still being reviewed by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords the vat leaflet to which my noble friend refers arose as a result of a specific inquiry about the chatsworth house trust to which i referred just now <e> <s> it was produced for guidance because there was clearly a lot of doubt as to whether or not vat was liable <e> <s> whether or not my right honourable friend was aware that the leaflet was about to be produced i cannot myself say <e> <s> but i am certain that he was fully aware of the implications of people not knowing what liability to vat they might have <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> vat is chargeable on assets to the business and if a house is open to the public it can be rightly said that a picture is an asset to the business and is vat-liable <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as putting these things away is concerned it is still a little early to say because i do not think the rules have been fully examined but as i have said they will be in due course <e> <s> i do not necessarily think that all works of art will be liable for vat because they will probably be passed on to others who are vat registered and who will be able to claim it back <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that that is another question which is rather wide of this one <e>", "<cs> my lords it will not necessarily have any effect <e> <s> there is a principle which is that vat which is a fairly wide tax is chargeable on business assets <e> <s> it would be only sensible that assets such as pictures which attract people to houses which are open to the public should be liable for the tax in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords british telecommunications are currently studying methods by which messages of an emergency nature can be communicated to addressees either without a telephone or whose telephone is out of order after the inland telegram service is withdrawn on st october <e> <s> no final decision has yet been reached <e>", "<cs> my lords to eliminate the drastic current losses on the telegram system pruning of the use of post offices is essential <e> <s> in the judgment of british telecommunications the service will not bear the payment of a handling charge to another organisation <e> <s> at present the payment made to the post office for telegram acceptance and delivery is running at about million to million a year <e>", "<cs> my lords this is very much a matter for british telecom and its commercial judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that both my right honourable friend the secretary of state for industry and british telecom will take note of the noble lords views <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness is referring to the transmission of money the answer is that a proposal to end the money transmission service if it is to be ended and hopefully it will not be has been put to the post office users national council for comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure about that but i shall certainly find out and write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perfectly true that in some cases the system will be more lengthy than has been the case with the traditional system <e> <s> but in exceptional cases of real emergency for example there is little doubt that some means will be achieved of actually getting the message through to the person for whom it is intended <e>", "<cs> no my lords it will be possible to send a greetings tele-message <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that it is unfortunate that the system allows for those colossal costs but at the same time it is important to bear in mind that there has been a decline in the use of the telegram system <e> <s> in million telegrams were sent and in only million and about per cent <e> <s> of those were in fact greeting messages <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house be now adjourned during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the funds for trade union ballots order be approved <e> <s> this order which will come into operation on th july extends section of the employment act <e> <s> this is the section which empowers the secretary of state to make regulations to establish a scheme which will allow payments to be made towards expenditure incurred by independent trade unions which hold secret ballots

consultative document <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first time i <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mccarthy and his noble friend fired questions at a most alarming rate <e> <s> i make no excuse at all for not being able to take them all in at the rate they put them <e> <s> i believe that i have covered the main points of this order and the amending regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable friend will take note of what the noble lord says and perhaps i might consult and write to the noble lord on those specific points <e> <s> one point that i did not cover and which i can now answer relates too the new paragraph h in regulation which he specifically raised <e> <s> this new provision relates only to ballots on wage offers <e> <s> it limits the eligibility to vote to trades union members who are affected by the proposal as the noble lord described <e> <s> thus the views of those not directly affected for example in a different industry would not qualify under the scheme otherwise it would be possible to create a false impression of popular support for the trade unions lines <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble lord says and the feeling of the house if it is the wish of noble lords opposite to have a fuller explanation i will withdraw the motion for hours as the noble lord requests <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may write to the noble lord on that specific point <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer the noble lord lord underhill now <e> <s> the certification officer will have the authority once the amending regulations have been introduced <e> <s> i hope that that answers his question <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wedderburn has described the amendment and the purpose of the clause and as he said the main purpose of the provision is to allow an employee to join as a party in unfair dismissal proceedings a union or other person who he alleges forced his employer by threat of industrial action to dismiss him because he was not a union member <e> <s> it may help the committee if i explain that under section of the employment act <e>", "<cs> not for the first time i am a little alarmed at following the noble lord lord wedderburn but i think that perhaps i can start with the point made by the noble lord lord jenkins <e> <s> if in doubt the employer of course should not dismiss an employee <e> <s> if an individual shop steward is in doubt as to whether he is likely to be joined in unfair dismissal proceedings he should not put any pressure on the employer to dismiss him <e> <s> it is perfectly true in all our lives that if <e>", "<cs> yes of course that is true but it is also true to say that it can be perfectly reasonable for someone to have very strong grounds for not wanting to take particular industrial action for example which he may feel might be politically motivated <e> <s> he might feel very strongly about it but i think that comes within exactly the same description as the noble lord seeks to give <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord wedderburn knows clause of the bill provides that employees or employers only have the right to require a union or other person to be joined to unfair dismissal proceedings if an application is made before the hearing of the complaint begins as the noble lord so adequately described just now <e> <s> it is clearly desirable that whenever possible joinder takes place before the start of the hearing so that all parties to the complaint the employee the employer and the joined party can be present throughout <e>", "<cs> first may i deal with the remarks made by the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> it seems to me that he is disputing what is regarded as normal court practice <e>", "<cs> yes it is <e> <s> i am no lawyer but i can assure the noble lord that the views of the governments legal advisers on this matter are perfectly plain <e> <s> i do not propose to debate it point by point tonight nor do i think the committee would wish me to <e> <s> on the noble lords other point it is almost certainly the case that tribunals will be reluctant to allow late joinder <e> <s> tribunals are sensible bodies and can be relied upon to act sensibly here as in every other case <e> <s> i do not believe that there is any fear that joinder will be too readily granted once a hearing has begun <e>", "<cs> yes the noble lord has made my point for me perfectly well <e> <s> it does not matter at all when the true reason for dismissal emerges <e> <s> it is exactly as i said <e>", "<cs> i think that with all respect the noble lord cannot have been listening to the point i made earlier <e> <s> the point was that while the right of joinder extended only to employers it was not essential to make any provision for joinder to take place after the commencement of the hearing for the simple reason as i said earlier that an employer will now know before a hearing whether or not he has been put under pressure to dismiss and thus can reach a decision on whether to join a trade union at that point <e> <s> the fact remains that the bill changes what the case was in <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to the noble lord in his arguments and i am grateful for the contributions made by my noble friends behind me <e> <s> i must start by saying that this amendment is totally unacceptable to the government <e> <s> the noble lord has argued that it is the equivalent of the closed shop conscience provision of the bill <e> <s> however that is not a valid comparison <e> <s> i shall not weary the committee now by repeating the reasons why conscientious objectors to union membership in a closed shop need to be protected <e> <s> these arguments were accepted by the donovan commission and by the tuc during the winter of discontent as the noble lord knows <e> <s> but there is one point that i must stress yet again <e> <s> the person who objects to union membership in a closed shop on conscientious grounds risks the loss of his livelihood if his objections are not respected <e> <s> therefore to keep his job he must swallow his conscience <e>", "<cs> i thought that we were moving the amendments and not the noble lord <e> <s> however the noble lord has really asked for clarification <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is asking for clarification on what comprises action short of dismissal <e> <s> i am sure he realises what it is it is anything which leads to an effect on a persons wages <e> <s> it can involve promotion wages indeed all sorts of things <e> <s> i do not think that there is any point in my expanding on the matter any further at this time of night because as the noble lord has said we have already been over the agreement in relation to the earlier amendments <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a commercial matter for british telecom <e> <s> but i understand that their expenditure on circulars sent in the post is in the region of a year and therefore extremely small in relation to the number of telephone subscribers and british telecoms annual turnover of around billion <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not strictly true to say that they make a profit from their circulars but of course the sending out of circulars increases revenue in certain areas <e> <s> so far as charges are concerned i think the noble baroness may feel that they do not relate strictly to the question <e> <s> but so far as i understand it it is the hope that it will not be necessary for one area of british telecom to subsidise another <e> <s> therefore the charges in one area might come down while the other goes up <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not see any reason at all why british telecom should not send out material with telephone bills if in their commercial judgment it is wise to do so <e> <s> it might help the noble lord if i say that the material which goes with bills mainly comprises private advertising the revenue from which more than compensates for the production and marginal distribution costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i enjoyed listening to the noble lords quotation of those extracts <e> <s> i confess that my late night reading has been a little short in the last couple of weeks and although he mentioned that he would quote that to me i am afraid i have not had a chance to look at it myself <e> <s> he will not be surprised to hear that the government cannot accept the amendment which as he says seeks to apply the affimative resolution procedure to orders made under clause of the bill for a period of three months from the coming into force of the powers in the bill in relation to the book entry transfer system <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins of putney in moving this amendment despite the fact that he has cloaked a lot of what he wants to say in relation to equity has certainly opened the opportunity for a debate on the principle that there should be ballots of existing closed shop arrangements and perhaps on the principle that we should protect non-union members in a closed shop <e> <s> i am very glad that he is not going to move amendment no <e> <s> as that amendment by repealing section of the act would also have removed the basic rights of employees to join trade unions and to take part in their activities <e> <s> no doubt his own front bench would have had something to say about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it might be for your lordships convenience if we now took a break <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that consideration on report be now adjourned until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mccarthy has quoted at length what i said at the committee stage <e> <s> we made it clear that the main intention of clause of the bill is to increase the likelihood that trade unions will have to face the consequences of their actions where they force an employer to dismiss an employee unfairly for not being a union member <e> <s> it is with this firm intention in mind that i approach these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord blease for his welcome of these redundancy payments schemes specifically and for his comments on shipbuilding generally and on harland and wolffs particular problems <e> <s> if i can first refer to the question of the note which was placed in the library earlier and which the noble lord said he had received so far as the booklet is concerned this is a matter for british shipbuilders <e> <s> they will produce in due course although i cannot say exactly when it will be available a guide for the benefit of those who seek to take up the redundancy scheme <e> <s> i can of course arrange for a copy of this to be placed in the library <e> <s> the noble lord also referred to the atlantic conveyor and welcomed the news that the replacement was to be built on tyneside <e> <s> it might also be interesting for him to know that harland and wolff have tendered for engine work on the vessel <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that my honourable friend the minister of state for northern ireland will pay very close heed to what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke to this order earlier <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords clause makes four important changes to the definition of what constitutes a lawful trade dispute <e> <s> the first and in my view perhaps the most important of these is to restrict lawful trade disputes to disputes between workers and their own employer <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton knows the main purpose of this is to protect employers and employees from pressure from trade unions and workers outside the company to force them to do something which they do not want to do <e> <s> at present the definition is so wide that a trade union can be in dispute with an employer even though it represents none of that employers workers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mccarthy has made plain the purpose of this amendment and of course one of the results of it is the protection of the international transport workers federations campaign against flags of convenience ships <e> <s> there seems to be some impression among noble lords opposite certainly it seems to be the view of the international transport workers federation itself that our amendments on definition of trade dispute are aimed specifically at the itwf <e>", "<cs> my lords the micros in primary schools scheme announced by my right honourable friend the prime minister in july opened for applications on st october <e> <s> under this scheme all primary schools are eligible for a per cent <e> <s> grant from the department of industry towards the purchase of one microcomputer package <e> <s> the scheme will run until the end of <e> <s> more than schools are eligible and so far several hundred applications have been received <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend <e> <s> this scheme is a major plank in the governments plans to help familiarise all young people with the technology which will increasingly play a major part in their daily lives and in the health of our economy <e> <s> the department of industrys scheme is deliberately catalytic and is aimed at getting schools and teachers started <e> <s> perhaps i might usefully add that the willingness of education to respond is illustrated by the outstanding success of the similar micros scheme for secondary schools under which more than per cent <e> <s> of secondary schools have obtained a microcomputer over the last months <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first question put by the noble baroness is concerned no this will not affect adversely any more cuts which have got to be made elsewhere in the system <e> <s> the total cost of this package will be approximately million over four years <e> <s> so far as the second question asked by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that question goes slightly wide of the original question which was restricted to microcomputers <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is certainly not going out of date and will be included <e> <s> i read a phrase the other day which the noble lord might also have read concerning computer literacy <e> <s> there is no doubt that over the next few years as this technological advance continues to grow computer literacy will be a very important part of all young peoples education <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the department of education teachers and all those responsible for passing on this kind of information to young children will take note of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> exactly my lords <e> <s> in many instances i believe it is the case that teachers are learning from children rather than the other way round <e>", "<cs> my lords iranians have been deported from the united kingdom between st january and th spetember i regret that it is not possible to say in how many of these cases the removal directions specified return to iran <e> <s> all decisions to deport are kept under review and reconsidered before departure is enforced <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are fully aware of the problems associated with returning iranians to iran <e> <s> the noble lord may like to know that since st january some iranians have expressed a fear to return to iran have been granted asylum and have been granted exceptional leave to remain <e> <s> six hundred and forty-four applications have been refused and the remainder have either been withdrawn or are still under consideration <e>",

for the moment about the university grants committee <e> <s> i shall look into the matter further and see if there is anything further that i can do to help the noble baroness <e> <s> the noble baroness also asked about tertiary colleges <e> <s> some local education authorities have already developed tertiary colleges <e> <s> other authorities are giving increased attention to links between schools and further education institutions recognising the value of the contribution that this can make towards bringing young people into touch with industry <e>", "<cs> my lords no individual who at present has access to telephone services will be deprived of them in the future <e> <s> i can also confirm that anyone who is able to obtain a telephone at present will be able to obtain a telephone under the new arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no truth in that allegation at all <e> <s> it would not i think be sensible for any particular distribution of kiosks to be laid down in any licence issued as a result of the telecommunications bill but the licence will oblige british telecom to continue to provide both the telephone kiosks and of course the service which makes much use of the telephone kiosks <e> <s> it would be wrong of me to go into the bill in detail now because it is already under discussion in another place but clause of the bill sets guidelines for my right honourable friend the secretary of state in issuing licences <e> <s> moreover in the functions relating to licences specific mention is made of these services and those to rural areas as needs to which both the director and my right honourable friend must have regard <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing to indicate that rural services cost more to run other than in the initial arrangements for connecting the telephone <e> <s> the charges remain the same for rural areas and broadly speaking for urban areas as well <e> <s> there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> he is absolutely right and it is also true that technological advances such as satellites should mean that it will become more practical to provide services to more areas than in fact exist at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that this would be an appropriate way to secure these services and neither does the chairman of british telecom <e> <s> it will provide no incentive to improve efficiency or quality of service <e> <s> i think it is also true that the service and telephone kiosks are an integral part of the british telecom services and it is far better to recognise this by an obligation placed on british telecom in its licence supported as necessary by revenues obtained from other services <e> <s> but this support will be made explicit to prevent hidden inefficiencies <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be competitive and yes there will be opportunities for commercial undertakings to compete with british telecom when the bill has been passed and the licences issued <e>", "<cs> no my lords there is no question of large numbers of call-boxes in rural areas being removed <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord could repeat his first supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state has made it perfectly clear that these claims are entirely without foundation <e> <s> as i said earlier licences will be issued as a result of the telecommunications bill and i think it would be wrong to go into the bill in detail now and british telecoms licence will oblige it and i emphasise those words to provide these services throughout the united kingdom which includes remote and rural areas <e> <s> it means that anyone who has access to a phone under the present arrangements will as i said in my original answer continue to do so under the new arrangements <e> <s> in their statement issued when the bill was published the british telecom board publicly accepted a continuing responsibility to provide services to both rural and outlying areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think i can be any more specific than i have been already <e> <s> in any case your lordships will have plenty of opportunity to discuss this in further detail when the bill comes before your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had explained that in british telecoms case the licence will oblige it to continue to provide those services <e> <s> as i understand it if anybody else undertakes to provide the services they too will be under the same obligations <e> <s> but at the present time it is british telecom who under the new arrangements will be obliged to maintain those services <e>", "<cs> my lords that matter really is wide of the original question and it will be discussed when the bill comes before your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord seebohm on this very thorough and interesting report and to thank him and his committee members for all the meticulous work and patience they have put into their deliberations and recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may answer some of the questions which have been raised in the debate which i think has been a very interesting one <e> <s> many very sound remarks have been made although i am afraid i cannot promise that the government will necessarily change their minds in the light of what has been said <e> <s> however i am quite certain that my right honourable friend will take note of all the points that have been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for what he has said and for agreeing with that particular part of what i have said <e> <s> the department of health and social security have considered also the feasibility of having no threshold for the national insurance scheme with a sliding scale of contributions based on earnings and hours worked which was another point which was raised <e> <s> my right honourable friend would be against such a proposal on the grounds of both principle and practicality in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> as i understand it regulations would be needed and they would follow on from the directive <e> <s> we could not be very wide of the mark in the way in which we implemented the directive in our own legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt a small measure of discrimination yes <e> <s> i do not think my right honourable friend would deny that for a moment <e> <s> but i am certain that when he has read what <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the reduction in the national insurance surcharge is to stimulate the private sector of industry by reducing the cost of employing labour <e> <s> by restricting the reduction to the private sector it is possible to give a higher level of assistance to industry than would otherwise be possible <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a central theme of the governments policies that the way to improve the position of this country is through the private sector of industry <e> <s> the question of the public sector is entirely different <e> <s> the effect of the bill which i point out to the noble lord is to come before your lordships house next week will be that the public sector both nationalised industries and local and central government will not be affected <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the first of the noble lords supplementary questions the nationalised industries and other central authorities will be affected by other means for example the adjustment of external financing limits and other methods of controlling their expenditure <e> <s> the whole point at the moment is that private industry is the means by which great britain will be got out of any trouble that it is in not the nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords this government did not introduce the national insurance surcharge <e> <s> it was introduced by the labour government in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do believe in a mixed economy but perhaps it would be helpful if we debated this matter more fully next week when the national insurance surcharge bill which specifically relates to the question is discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his helpful remarks yes that is the case <e> <s> this country depends hugely on the efforts of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is wide of the original question <e> <s> however as i have said if discrimination has to be applied then the alterations due to the change in the taxation will be made in other ways through for example external financing limits and the other measures which i described earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry will the noble lord repeat the first part of his question which i did not hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is always the case but there tends to be a risk that that could be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend lord nugent will listen to what the noble lord says <e> <s> but as i said earlier there is nothing to alter the position so far as nationalised industries and central government are concerned because other means can be used to adjust the way in which this particular burden falls <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid i do not accept what the noble lord says <e> <s> it does not follow that there will be any disadvantageous competitive practice <e> <s> if a private sector firm uses the benefit of the surcharge reduction to reduce its borrowing then it is in precisely the same position as a nationalised industry which does so <e> <s> in any case if a nationalised industry has a substantial change in its competitive position for whatever reason the government as i have said can make an appropriate change in its external financing limit <e> <s> i think i have now said that four times <e>", "<cs> my lords receipts sales of public sector concerns which have already been completed will amount to million by the end of the financial year net of all expenses <e> <s> three-quarters of those proceeds have been retained by the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords the receipts have simply gone towards reducing the public sector borrowing requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords the cash that results from these sales is of course welcome in the form of any future relief both to the public sector borrowing requirement and the taxpayer but the benefits go <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of that particular letter but i shall certainly look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been doing so and i am sure that my right honourable friend will take note of what has been said including what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord elton i beg to introduce a bill to enable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mccarthy and to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for their welcome to this order <e> <s> as regards the imbalance if that is the right word between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> to which the noble lord lord mccarthy referred i point out that per cent <e> <s> is the figure recommended as desirable by all sides of the industry for the coming year <e> <s> last year the figure was per cent <e> <s> subject to the overall limit of a per cent <e> <s> levy on the pay roll <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the unanimous welcome that these regulations have received <e> <s> that they come just before christmas is perhaps fortuitous but nevertheless i am most grateful to all noble lords for their kind remarks <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy i think i got him right asked about the relativity of the per cent <e> <s> to the increase in rpi over the period that the act has been in force <e> <s> the current rates of compensation came into operation on st january <e> <s> as i said the new rates represent an increase of per cent <e> <s> and will restore the value of these payments to what they were when first calculated <e> <s> it might be helpful if i pointed out to the noble lord that the retail price index for example rose per cent <e> <s> between january when the present rates came into operation and november so the per cent <e> <s> represents something over the increase in rpi in that period <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mccarthy argues that the increases that are being made by the orders are not in line with inflation and that anyhow the two are completely separate <e> <s> perhaps i ought to point out that so far as the second order is concerned the per cent <e> <s> does in fact broadly reflect inflation the increase in the rpi anyway over the last months <e> <s> i can give him the figures which i am sure he already knows relating to the last months <e> <s> in october the figure was plus per cent <e> <s> and in november it was plus per cent <e> <s> so per cent <e> <s> is rather more than that <e> <s> the answer to the question of the noble lord lord kilmarnock about whether that reflects what inflation will do over the next year is that inflation is going to be lower than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be a mistake to go back to discuss pneumoconiosis <e> <s> we have in fact closed the book on that <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the implication of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> the answer is that i have made it perfectly plain that the secretary of state had to take into account various factors before making these awards and these are the best that can be produced in the circumstances which pertain at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move this motion formally <e>", "<cs> my lords british telecom regard the telemessage service as competing with private priority mail services and therefore information about the service is commercially sensitive <e> <s> however i can say that since the ending of the inland telegram service on st october the volume of telemessages sent has doubled and is rising rapidly <e>", "<cs> yes my lords telemessages are proving to be an adequate substitute for the telegram and i think the increase in their use which i have described reflects this <e> <s> british telecom have not assessed the contents of messages or class of sender <e> <s> however at present special greetings cards account for per cent <e> <s> of telemessages sent <e> <s> the indications are that business messages have been increasing more rapidly than social messages <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to give a figure because i am afraid british telecom regard that <e>", "<cs> telemessages my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords from the figure of the number of telemessages sent in october <e>", "<cs> my lords the telegram service which british telecommunications ran was losing a colossal amount of money and that is why the government took a keen interest in it and decided to help encourage british telecom to produce a slightly more worthwhile and slightly more financially rewarding form of message <e> <s> i quite agree that there are of course losses as a result but the noble lord might like to know that he can arrange for his telemessage to be sent up to eight oclock in the evening and it will be delivered by first-class mail the next day <e> <s> if it is not his money will be refunded <e>", "<cs> of course my lords this is not a matter for the government but for british telecom <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot provide the figures for which the noble lord asked earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords information technology year has been an outstanding success in raising the general level of awareness of new technology among businessmen and the general public and in encouraging its wider application <e> <s> an opinion poll conducted at the start of the year showed that only per cent <e> <s> of those interviewed were aware of it by the end of the year this figure had increased to per cent <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords <e> <s> we have made significant progress in encouraging the application and use of information technology <e> <s> during the year a number of new schemes were introduced by the department of industry to help industry develop and use new products <e> <s> these include schemes for flexible manufacturing systems computer-aided design manufacture and test micro-computers for gps launched by my noble friend lord trefgarne software products the small engineering firms investment scheme and fibre optics <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it will be through information technology among other things that the level of unemployment will probably be reduced because this country has a wealth of expertise in the area and through developing it we will probably be able to reduce the number of unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a great deal being done in this country at the moment to promote hardware <e> <s> i cannot give the names to my noble friend at this particular moment but i would certainly be happy to supply him with them in due course <e> <s> it might also be worth bearing in mind that many advances are being made in software as well as hardware and there is a trend towards the design of these things being software-led and not hardware-led <e>", "<cs> my lords at the younger end of the education scale nearly secondary schools have applied for per cent <e> <s> funding for a microcomputer under the micros for schools scheme and virtually every secondary school now has at least one micro <e> <s> in addition my right honourable friend the prime minister announced the extension of the scheme to primary schools from st october and over of these schools have already applied <e> <s> i can also tell the noble lord that under the department of education and sciences microelectronics education programme provision has been made in the current financial year for some advisers and teachers to receive training for microcomputers in education <e>", "<cs> my lords i really think that that question is rather wide of the mark <e> <s> if the noble lord puts down a question on that specific subject i am sure that it will be adequately answered <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i quite agree with what my noble friend says <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is the case at all <e> <s> i quite agree with the noble baroness that to have more than one computer is highly desirable <e> <s> nevertheless these machines cost money and someone has to decide from where the money has to come <e> <s> the suggestion of its being a gimmick is simply not the case at all <e> <s> i think i said in answer to an earlier question that there are those who believe that in the future people in this country will be either computer literate or computer illiterate <e> <s> that is why it is so important to start our young people off very early with the skills and the knowledge of this scheme <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i believe that it is through the development of technology that we shall be able to compete in the world and be able to create jobs <e> <s> i believe that there are various parts to any strategy which might exist and i think i can say that our information technology industry and business in general need a modern and <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can give the noble viscount an answer to that without due notice <e> <s> the government have announced their intention to increase the programme of recruitment by the universities of additional researchers and lecturers particularly in the field of scientific research <e> <s> an additional provision of million is also to be made in for the expansion of research and the training of qualified manpower in fields related to it <e>", "<cs> my lords there are those who believe that in due course computers may be able to think without being programmed but i think we are a little way off that yet <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid that i have not got that information but i shall find out and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are glad to have this opportunity to debate these regulations <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord colville of culross for the way in which he has explained the points he has raised <e> <s> although these regulations have been generally welcomed they have it is true attracted strong opposition from one quarter namely the organisations representing the cinema industry <e> <s> in the governments view that opposition is ill-founded for reasons which i shall shortly explain <e>", "<cs> we are talking about videos my lords <e>", "<cs> they would not be able to grant licences my lords to certain premises for the showing of films despite the fact that fire precaution measures were judged to be quite satisfactory in relation to the principal use to which the premises were put <e> <s> these representations were very carefully considered by the home office <e> <s> in the light of them it was concluded that the problem was indeed an urgent one and that the way to deal with it was to amend the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend the minister of state for defence procurement has expressed his concern by letter to the united states government and will discuss the matter further when he visits the united states at the end of next month <e> <s> meanwhile the ministry of defence is in close touch with martin baker the company concerned about the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly believe that it is against the spirit of the memorandum of understanding <e> <s> as regards the second part of my noble friends supplementary question at present the balance of trade is a little under two to one in favour of the united states <e> <s> this compares with over four to one in favour of the united states when the memorandum was signed in and is a tribute to the competitiveness of the united kingdom defence industry <e> <s> moreover the full effect of significant united kingdom orders such as those for hawk avb and rapier has still to be felt <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it to date lives have been saved by martin baker seats <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a short but i think a very useful debate on the policy and purpose of this bill <e> <s> it has been a debate which has clearly demonstrated your lordships sympathy with the difficulties encountered by certain categories of people who wish to be married under the law as it stands today so i am grateful for the support which has been given to the proposals that the bill contains <e> <s> as my noble friend lord elton has explained these proposals are designed to relieve hardship and to facilitate the individuals right to marry and this is a right acknowledged in our adherence to the european convention <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that not too many people who read the certificates will have actually been to jebb road but what the noble lord says is correct <e> <s> the private address of the prison will be shown and the words hm prison will in fact not appear <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should now like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my honourable friend the minister of state for industry and information technology on telecommunications policy <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede and the noble baroness lady seear for their comments <e> <s> the noble lord lord ponsonby asked me a number of questions which i shall endeavour to answer <e> <s> to begin with he pointed out that this was a complex statement involving a complex report and that it also relates to the telecommunications bill which as your lordships will know is in committee in another place at present <e> <s> therefore a great deal of the subject matter will come before your lordships house for discussion in due course <e>", "<cs> no my lords not necessarily because if the subscriber calls upon for example british telecommunications to come and investigate his fault then under the system to be introduced british telecommunications would be delighted to repair the instrument even if it was not theirs but of course they would do so for a charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i really cannot agree with the noble lord lord diamond that this is a contradictory statement <e> <s> as he is aware the bill is in the process of discussion in committee in another place and that i should have thought was a very obvious part of the parliamentary process <e> <s> it will be further amended as are other bills indeed all bills when it comes before your lordships <e> <s> it has been given a great deal of consideration <e> <s> it will he discussed here in debate at second reading <e> <s> but i agree with the noble lord that it is certainly an extremely complex bill and in my view it is best to leave any discussion of it until it comes before your lordships house <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can give that assurance and i have already given it on more than one occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> british telecommunications will be obliged by their licence to maintain the services <e> <s> the access fee will apply to connections between one area and another <e> <s> this matter is extremely complex and it took me a great deal of time to understand it myself when it was first explained to me and i am sure that the same will apply to the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> the internal subsidy is consistent with competition policy if all competitors that is to say bt mercury hull and anyone else who comes in pay access fees <e> <s> as in fact they will have to <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think that we are going rather wide of the statement <e> <s> these are matters that are concerned with the bill itself and i am sure the noble lord will agree that it is best to debate them in due course <e>", "<cs> i think this may be a convenient moment to move that the house be now resumed and to say that the committee will resume at a quarter to eight <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount has explained in introducing these amendments his desire to ensure that the register is as full and informative a document as possible <e> <s> the government certainly share his wish that the particulars entered on the register should give a proper indication of the matters to which they relate and that is why clause <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount urges us to extend the list of a users details which are to be placed on the register so that they will include a brief description of the processing facilities including system software and software products and their main locations <e> <s> although i understand the reasons for the amendment i do not believe that its adoption will help <e> <s> what it would in fact achieve would be to involve data users in extensive work and be of limited help to the registrar <e> <s> i say this because in many respects the data protection principles can be policed without reference to the processing facilities which hold the personal data <e> <s> the main exception to that is where security measures are concerned the eighth principle <e> <s> but even there although knowledge of a users facilities may on occasion be of interest to the registrar in considering matters such as security and reliability the value of such knowledge will vary according to the nature of a data users operations <e>", "<cs> the purpose of clause <e>", "<cs> a data controller is in fact an individual and so i hope that that puts my noble friends mind at rest <e> <s> i think i have indicated the reasons why we have doubts about this amendment and why we see merit in confining the register entry in this respect to a single person or post <e> <s> i would suggest that most data users will in fact wish that to be the case so that as many requests as possible come to a central point from which access requests can be co-ordinated and monitored <e> <s> i hope for that reason that my noble friend lord mottistone will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> i understand the points that my noble friend is making <e> <s> in the light of what he has said i shall be happy to consider the point further <e> <s> if on reflection the clear disadvantages of allowing more than one individual to be specified seem to be outweighed by the advantages then we shall come forward with an appropriate amendment in due course <e> <s> with that undertaking i hope that my noble friend will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to the case that the noble lord lord wigoder has made for this amendment <e> <s> i understand why he thinks it would be helpful for the individual nominated by a data user for the purposes of clause <e>", "<cs> a fundamental feature of the bill is the requirement on all data users who hold personal data subject to the most limited exemptions to register particulars relevant <e>", "<cs> with regard to the point raised by my noble friend lord renton about the words <e>", "<cs> clause of the bill in effect enforces the requirement to register by making it an offence to hold personal data or to provide services in respect of personal data as a person carrying on a computer bureau while unregistered <e> <s> in relation to data users it is also to be an offence for a person to operate beyond the particulars included in his entry in the register <e> <s> one aspect of this is the prohibition in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been no delay <e> <s> evaluation of the proposals is proceeding according to the timetable agreed with the bidders <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of a longterm piece of military equipment is somewhat different from the agreeably highly commendable speed with which companies reacted to the falklands crisis <e> <s> in any case it is absolutely true to say that the speed with which this particular consideration is being undertaken by the ministry of defence bearing in mind that the request for proposals was issued in august that the proposals were received in december and that the evaluation hopefully will be complete by the end of march in fact already means a fairly compressed timetable <e> <s> so far as employment in the north-west is concerned to which my noble friend refers both the manufacture of alarm and harm would entail work being carried out by the contractors in the north-west <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposals are being considered and the result of those considerations will be made known when the decision is reached at the end of march <e> <s> beyond that i am afraid i cannot say <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government are seized of the importance of domestic sales of high technology products as a basis for exports <e> <s> british products are ordered by government departments whenever possible but they must offer value for money <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are committed to creating the most favourable climate possible for industrial progress and much has already been done especially in the fight against inflation <e> <s> the effective use of public purchasing also has a vital role to play in promoting innovation in high technology <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend will be aware that this subject received a very thorough airing yesterday and was very well answered by my noble friend lord belstead <e> <s> in this particular context i do not think that i can usefully add to what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course <e> <s> yesterday i answered a question on the anti-radar missile <e> <s> it is the policy of the ministry of defence to buy british equipment to the maximum extent consistent with this countrys international obligations unless there are substantial advantages of timescale cost or performance in buying overseas <e> <s> the noble lord might like to know that in recent years over per cent <e> <s> of the expenditure of the ministry of defence has been with british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that but i am grateful to my noble friend for drawing it to my attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asked an earlier supplementary question on the benefits of our own high technology being used abroad because we are second to none in so many fields <e> <s> as regards other nations no doubt they will wish to purchase their own equipment as well <e>", "<cs> concern has been expressed that the registration requirement under the bill will <e>", "<cs> i understand the points behind the remarks of both my noble friends lord mottistone and lord swinfen particularly as they relate to matters overseas <e> <s> the small variations that my noble friend lord mottistone describes in part of his amendment lead to considerable effects which i think i described admirably not admirably but which i described <e> <s> i shall certainly look at what has been said and perhaps in the light of my assurance that we will look at them my noble friend will see fit to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to what the noble lord lord mishcon has said and i am bound to say that i agree with a great deal of it <e> <s> these amendments propose a most interesting new concept for consideration and i am sure that the committee will have listened with attention to what the noble lord has said on behalf of those amendments <e> <s> the idea of placing responsibility for compliance with the data protection principles back in the hands of the data users concerned rather than imposing a detailed system of regulations in regard to them is one which is superficially attractive <e> <s> but i am also bound to point out that there are a number of serious defects in the scheme which the noble lord proposes <e> <s> these defects are of so fundamental a character that we are bound to conclude that the approach itself is simply not on <e>", "<cs> my mind is of course open to all suggestions that come in the form of what is said in the committee and in the amendments that are tabled but we shall come to the point made by the noble lord lord wigoder in due course <e>", "<cs> clause is concerned with those who supply false information to the registrar in connection with an application for registration or for the alteration of registered particulars <e> <s> it already provides that it shall be an offence knowingly or recklessly to furnish the registrar with information which is false or misleading in a material respect as the noble lord described <e> <s> the amendment is an attempt to extend that offence to include failure to furnish the registrar with any material information <e>", "<cs> i think it might now be convenient to take the statement <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> this might perhaps be a convenient moment to break for dinner until a quarter to eight <e> <s> i beg to move that the house be now resumed <e>", "<cs> i am certainly very grateful for the remarks of the noble lord lord mishcon so far as the tabling of the amendment is concerned <e> <s> it is a very complex matter and of course if amendments are tabled late it is very difficult to get all the facts at ones fingertips <e> <s> i think the point about access to the revenue information to which the noble lord referred as a case in point is something which we shall have to check specifically in due course <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate the need for parliament to examine the justification when any new <e>", "<cs> we are not in fact breaking new ground <e> <s> there are numerous examples of existing powers of entry conferred on public officials and the police some not dependent on obtaining a warrant from a justice of the peace which are not limited to cases involving criminal offences <e> <s> i can give examples <e> <s> one is schedule paragraph to the gas act which authorises entry into premises served by gas to inspect meters fitted <e>", "<cs> to be honest i did not hear all that the noble lord said <e> <s> i should like to read in <e>", "<cs> the committee will wish to consider the proposed powers of entry under clause to ensure that appropriate safeguards are built in <e> <s> as your lordships would expect the government have borne that need in mind in preparing the clause <e> <s> the power of entry search inspection and seizure is available only where a warrant has been issued by a justice of the peace and normally only where there has been a previous request for and a refusal of access <e> <s> another limitation to which the amendment relates is that a warrant should be exercised at a reasonable hour unless that might result in the evidence sought not being found <e> <s> under the amendment that requirement would be altered in the way the noble lord described so that a warrant would not normally be executed between pm and am <e>", "<cs> i am advised that clause contains the words which apply in this particular case <e>", "<cs> it may help to shorten our consideration of amendment no <e> <s> if i indicate the governments attitude at an early stage <e> <s> i have earlier described the powers that clause of the bill introduces <e> <s> clause requires that where a warrant has been executed it should be endorsed stating whether any documents or other material have been seized in pursuance of it <e> <s> this is designed to give the issuing authority information on the use made of warrants issued by it and follows a recommendation of the royal commission on criminal procedure <e> <s> the amendment moved by my noble friend lord mottistone would extend this requirement so that where such a warrant had been executed the endorsement to be made would also have to include a statement as to whether data equipment had been inspected examined operated or tested in pursuance of the warrant <e>", "<cs> the amendment of the noble lord lord wigoder would go rather beyond the detail which i described and which was contained in lord mottistones earlier amendment <e> <s> it will provide that where a warrant was executed the inspection examination operating and testing of any data equipment or data material would have to be carried out in a way which would not impede the data users business <e> <s> thus it would seem that wherever any impediment however small was caused the inspection examination or operation of any data equipment would be rendered unlawful <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly read what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i did not undertake to consider amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i undertook to consider amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for raising this point <e> <s> legal professional privilege is an important principle in british law <e> <s> it is vital for the integrity of the judicial process to protect the confidences that pass between an individual and his legal adviser <e> <s> the courts recognise this and cannot require such confidences to be exposed <e> <s> in clause the government recognise it also by exempting data covered by legal professional privilege from the subject access provisions thus preventing third parties from gaining access to data concerning them which has been passed in confidence by a client to his legal adviser <e>", "<cs> following our discussion of the amendment of my noble friend to clause the reason for this amendment to clause is quite clear i think <e> <s> on the previous clause the wish was to ensure that no third party not even the registrar under his powers of entry should be entitled to see information to which legal professional privilege attaches <e> <s> on this clause it is the desire to ensure that solicitors and barristers who will be the holders of such information are under no obligation to show the registrar this information in the context of the normal discharge of his functions <e> <s> but we believe that the two situations are different <e> <s> we have to accept that clause as drafted might entitle the registrar to inspect and seize documents and material attracting legal professional privilege <e> <s> it is on that basis that we have undertaken to look at this further <e>", "<cs> this amendment would provide an entitlement for what it terms the relevant data subject to be heard by any court considering ordering the forfeiture destruction or erasure of data material in accordance with clause <e> <s> my noble friend has explained why he believes that such a provision is necessary but i am afraid that i neither see a case for such a provision nor do i believe that it would be workable in the form proposed <e> <s> the intention of the amendment appears to be to ensure that the interests of data subjects are not harmed by the forfeiture destruction or erasure of data relevant to them but i cannot believe that any court deciding to take this action would not have had the interests of data subjects very firmly in mind before deciding to do so <e> <s> indeed the whole purpose of subsection is to enable the court to conclude that harm could be done if the data in question were left unaltered in the hands of the data user and that it would be in the interests of those affected for an order under this subsection to be made <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend lord mottistone for raising this question as to the registration of companies and groups of companies but i only wish that we could have seen it earlier because it raises complicated issues of both a legal and an administrative nature <e> <s> these issues need very careful study <e> <s> as we have already made clear the government have sought to ensure that the process of registration should be as simple as possible in order to avoid creating an undue burden on users <e>", "<cs> i think perhaps now might be a convenient moment to break for dinner until <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i understand the point that my noble friend makes with this change in the batting now <e> <s> it does not mean however that the crown is under no kind of obligation as a result of the bill <e> <s> clause deliberately excuses government departments from the liability to prosecution under part ii of the bill but it excuses departments from nothing else <e> <s> departments will still remain under the obligation to register so it will be an offence not to register and they will still be liable to the exercise of the registrars notice powers <e>", "<cs> since the publication of the bill it has become apparent that there are even more devious minds dare i say it <e> <s> than those possessed by some members of the home office <e> <s> prior to publication of the bill it had not become apparent to us that anyone should interpret clause as applicable to the provisions of the official secrets act <e> <s> i should like to assure the committee categorically that there has been no intention in the governments mind of using this provision for the kind of blanket exemption which some claim that it could provide <e> <s> in the governments view to use this provision in such a way would so nullify the provisions applying the bill to the crown that it would come close indeed to an abuse of the powers conferred by the subsection <e> <s> in order therefore to reassure the committee of the governments good faith in this regard we are very ready to give to this provision the added guarantee which would be provided by making it subject to the approval of each house <e> <s> therefore i am happy to accept the noble and learned lords amendment <e>", "<cs> clause of the bill is fairly complicated and establishes transitional arrangements to enable the provisions of the bill to come progressively into force and it has been designed so as to allow sufficient time for both the registrar and those who will be affected by the legislation to complete the various tasks that will be required of them <e>", "<cs> i am afraid we do not believe that the bill is in need of elaborate phasing-in provisions <e> <s> why do we need to place on the registrar the burden of deciding who should register first who later <e> <s> what yardsticks is he to use what limit should the time-scale have how does he deal with multiple users <e> <s> the main objective must surely be to establish the register at the earliest opportunity enabling us to move as rapidly as possible to ratification of the convention <e> <s> that is why we have gone for the approach in the bill of an <e>", "<cs> to place users in the position where the registrar could insist upon full compliance with the requirements of the legislation only six months after the day to be appointed by the secretary of state under clause could be to place some users under substantial economic and administrative burdens <e> <s> i make no apology for resisting that proposal on this ground alone <e> <s> the government are as anxious as anyone to see the

of this bill to provide <e>", "<cs> four my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords of the four servicemen injured by mines one is currently receiving treatment at queen elizabeths military hospital in woolwich

will bear with me for a moment while i elaborate my argument a little further <e> <s> just now i stated again that no decisions have been taken on this public information exercise <e> <s> however

campaign to promote british and nato defence policies including possession of nuclear weapons involving full-page newspaper advertisements very good advertisements i think it is fair to say which invited readers to send for a booklet and i have copies of the advertisement with me here <e> <s> allowing for inflation the expenditure of the labour government at that time on their publicity

deter attack at any level coupled with a relentless search for balanced and verifiable measures of multilateral disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords if i was wrong then of course i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> but what are the facts and information that the government might be promoting that have caused such an outcry <e> <s> they are facts such as britains membership of nato an organisation set up by the countries of western europe and north america after the second world war because of the fears caused by russian expansion in europe facts such as nato being a purely defensive alliance whose members regard attack on one as an attack on all and are pledged to assist each other that the alliance has no aggressive intention against any other country and has publicly stated that its weapons nuclear or conventional will never be used in europe except in the event of attack facts such as that the greatest threat to our security springs from the soviet union and the warsaw pact

actually seen on channel <e> <s> but so far as the noble lords views are concerned i think the best way to approach the problem is for all of those who feel strongly about matters that are on channel

the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i must confess that the noble lord lord mishcon has to some extent caught me on the hop with this one <e> <s> i will do my best to try to explain <e>", "<cs> the right reverend prelate has very fairly returned to a point he raised in his speech in the second reading debate on this bill in which he voiced the concern felt by some prison chaplains that marriages of prisoners should after this bill comes into operation ordinarily be solemnized inside prison rather than in a church or register office outside <e> <s> he has referred in that context to the parish church as the most suitable venue for a church of england ceremony as likely to provide a much more appropriate atmosphere for the couple and wedding guests than an institution <e>", "<cs> i am certain that my noble friend lord elton and the home office will read carefully what has been said by those noble lords who have spoken tonight on this subject <e> <s> as i understand it there are three categories of prisoner with which we are concerned <e> <s> first there are those who cannot be let out under any circumstances whatever because they are a danger in whatever way and i think that all noble lords who have spoken realise that <e> <s> then there are those who can be let out under escort for whatever reason and then there are those who in some cases are allowed out without escort because they are trusted to return again <e> <s> it is the second category in which we are interested <e> <s> i am afraid that what i said before about the staffing arrangements holds good <e> <s> it is something <e>", "<cs> as the committee will be aware though i think it needs reinforcing the bill deals only with the place of marriage not with the law in relation to who has or has not the capacity to marry <e> <s> my noble friends and those who advise them and other noble lords who have spoken might feel that in some way the bill introduces some new right to marry <e> <s> i felt that i should preface my remarks by saying that <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government are anxious that the full benefits of information technology are made available to severely handicapped people <e> <s> to this end the government have launched a number of initiatives specifically designed to help disabled people through use of the new technology <e> <s> for example the open university is developing a synthetic speech output for the blind and money is being provided for the development of equipment which will help people who are both deaf and blind to communicate using specially adapted telephones <e> <s> there are also projects for information technology to help children with learning difficulties to develop word-processing for the blind and to provide visual display to help speech development for the deaf <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are keeping in close touch with similar developments within the european community and are pleased that the eec have recently launched the handynet concept details of which i can provide for my noble friend <e> <s> this will facilitate the exchange of information in technological and other developments to aid disabled people <e> <s> so far as the dissemination of information is concerned my noble friend will be aware of the five new communication aids centres <e> <s> they are a welcome addition to the area of disseminating information about communication aids but <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble baroness for drawing that exhibition to the attention of your lordships <e> <s> the exhibition has been sponsored by the department of industry and is to be opened by my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly bear in mind what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i have in front of me a list of or department of industry projects for information technology and the disabled <e> <s> that list can be made available immediately <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a good point but the provision of this equipment is extremely expensive <e> <s> it is probably better that funding should be available more generally than too specifically <e> <s> the equipment about which the noble lord speaks is often produced in

of my noble friend lord elton i beg to move the motion standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> i think that this might be a convenient moment for the committee to break for dinner until pm <e> <s> i beg to move that the house be now resumed <e>", "<cs> my lords this may be an appropriate moment at which to break for dinner and i beg to move that the house do now adjourn until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend indicated the amendment is based on the worthy desire to ensure that the registrars entry powers are subject to the strictest possible control and are not used except where absolutely necessary <e> <s> his concern among other things appears to be that the registrar might seek an entry warrant in a case where he suspected a purely technical breach of one of the principles in circumstances likely to lead to no conceivable harm to anyone <e> <s> that appears a very reasonable point of view at first sight but i am sorry to have to say that on closer examination the government cannot go along with this proposal and i will explain why <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord mottistone said i indicated in committee that the government were prepared to look again at the requirement in clause of the bill to see whether it would be appropriate to require those executing warrants to provide more information to the issuing authority <e> <s> this we have now done and i am pleased to be able to tell my noble friend that the government are persuaded that more information should be included on returned warrants <e> <s> endorsing warrants is the means by which issuing authorities are able to check that the grounds advanced for the issue of a warrant have been justified in the event and we agree that the issuing authority should be told more than as is provided in the bill at present <e> <s> indeed we believe that there is a case for going further and for requiring also that those who execute warrants should be obliged to indicate whether the power to inspect any documents or other material was exercised in pursuance of the warrant <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has suggested a limitation on the circumstances in which any documents or other material seized through the exercise of a search warrant under clause may be retained <e> <s> under the bill as cast such material <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i too must part company from my noble friend on this occasion though i hope not for long because of the arguments he advocates on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords it was my noble friend lord mottistone in committee who ran the first leg of what i suppose could be considered a bit of a relay race on this amendment and now he has handed it on i hope not unwillingly to the noble lord lord elystan-morgan <e> <s> in committee i indicated that we recognised the importance of the principle which lies at the heart of legal professional privilege and i asked for time to reflect on what i think i called the dilemma that my noble friend lord mottistone had revealed to us <e> <s> that time was graciously given to us but i have to say that i need to ask for more <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i must tell my noble friend that i still have to remain firm on this point <e> <s> as my noble friend has indicated this amendment is similar to one that we discussed in committee modified to take account of certain of the difficulties that we identified then as being raised by the amendment <e> <s> as well as identifying particular difficulties i argued generally that there was no need to make provision along the lines proposed by the amendment because of the way that the courts would in any event approach these matters <e> <s> i had hoped that i might have satisfied my noble friend <e> <s> but sadly that was not to be <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we are still interested and i hope i can be a little more forthcoming to my noble friend <e> <s> as your lordships recall these amendments reproduce a group of amendments which as my noble friend said were discussed in committee <e> <s> because they were only available rather late in the day we agreed to take them away for consideration <e> <s> we have had the opportunity to give some thought to the issues involved but i have to tell him that we have not yet reached a final view <e>", "<cs> my lords with characteristic determination the noble lord lord houghton has reintroduced this bill to amend the pet animals act <e> <s> as he has said he has introduced a similar bill in each of the last two sessions and on both occasions it passed through all its stages in your lordships house <e> <s> it is a measure of his tireless efforts to improve the lot of animals that the noble lord has not been discouraged from reintroducing this particular bill <e> <s> when he spoke he was good enough to refer to a private members bill which i had to do with a year ago and which dealt with red deer in scotland <e> <s> i must confess that when i had taken that bill through all its stages here i vowed to myself that i would never get drawn into a debate on animals in your lordships house again <e> <s> but i find myself here in a different guise this afternoon <e> <s> when that bill was introduced my noble friend lord mansfield speaking from the front bench referred to bills such as that as being tender plants <e> <s> the noble lord and others this afternoon have pointed out that this is still the case that they are tender plants when it comes to their treatment in another place <e> <s> so perhaps i ought to say now so as to remove any element of suspense that the government do not propose to stand in the way of the bill for reasons which i shall explain <e>", "<cs> my lords this may be a convenient moment to break for dinner and i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned until twenty minutes to nine <e>", "<cs> my lords not before twenty to nine <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel somewhat self-conscious in view of a barrage of legal expertise such as that both behind me and in front of me <e> <s> but the noble and learned lord lord gardiner raised a number of questions the first of which was the question of precedents <e> <s> the noble and learned lord asked whether there were any precedents for treating a government department as a person for the purposes of a statute <e> <s> i have to say that i know of no direct precedent <e> <s> but that is because we have not hitherto needed to legislate for government departments in the way that has been required in this bill <e> <s> obviously it was necessary to provide that the personal data held by government departments and similar bodies should be subject to the bill <e> <s> and we were determined to achieve this in the most effective way open to us <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as lord hyltons point is concerned i understand that they would both have to change their registered particulars in the case of a splitting of the departments <e> <s> my noble friend lord swinfens point i think may also be covered by that answer <e> <s> i hope it satisfies him <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to my noble friends explanation of the amendment <e> <s> it is one of a series in which he is drawing to our attention certain points as to the way the bill has been drafted or structured <e> <s> i am only too ready to undertake that we will study carefully what he said and consider the implications <e> <s> but many of your lordships will accept i know that too much subordinate detail in a bill tends to obscure its main principles <e> <s> for this reason therefore we have been careful to place such matters in the schedules or to leave them out of the bill altogether where they are not needed at all <e> <s> but when it came to the requirement that statutory instruments concerned with access fees registration fees and the period of registration should be laid before parliament after being made it seemed to us reasonable to place this requirement in the body of the bill <e> <s> it is of course the frequency of the renewal period which will affect the level of the fee and hence the link to which my noble friend referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what the noble lord has said but i have to say that i have grave doubts as to whether the amendment that he proposes would in fact achieve its purpose <e> <s> there are two points which i can put briefly <e> <s> first there are significant advantages in achieving comprehensive registration at an early stage and secondly there is no need for elaborate phasing-in provisions for registration <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had convinced the noble lord at committee with the arguments that i advocated then <e> <s> however i see i did not quite succeed so i shall have to repeat them <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i can tell the noble lord that he is correct that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with some trepidation to deal with this amendment not only because i am well aware of my noble friends formidable reputation in matters of this kind but also because as he rightly says the matter is complicated <e> <s> as we have stated on a number of occasions the government wish to ensure that the bill does not impose an undue burden on resources <e> <s> it is therefore essential that it should make provision to give an adequate time period for data users and computer bureaux to come into compliance with the scheme <e> <s> this involves the postponement of the application of certain of the obligations imposed and powers conferred by the bill and that is what clause is primarily all about <e> <s> it would appear right therefore that these matters be spelt out on the face of the bill <e> <s> the question of when statutory rights and duties apply in this way is on this occasion at least surely too fundamental to the effect of the bill to be left to a schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords we have arrived at another point in the bill where the balance between the need to protect the data subject and the desire not to impede the sensible use of personal data by data users is particularly difficult <e> <s> during an earlier amendment we touched on clause and i ought to go into it a little more <e> <s> it is complex <e> <s> the effect of clause is to disapply those provisions of the bill that have the effect of requiring data to be accurate during the initial six-month period after the day to be appointed by the secretary of state and to disapply them thereafter in respect of data that the user can show have been held since before the end of that period <e> <s> clause first disapplies clause which entitles a data subject to apply to the courts for compensation where damaged by the inaccuracy of personal data and thereby disapplies the similar right in respect of rectification under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for the welcome he has given to this order <e> <s> the service declaration forms forms j k l and m of the regulations have been omitted from the forms prescribed by the regulations for england and wales <e> <s> the prescribed forms are unnecessary as the contents of a service declaration form are set out by the representation of the people act <e> <s> this still means that any person who knowingly makes a false statement in his service declaration form will continue to be guilty of an offence under the perjury act <e> <s> for similar reasons no form is prescribed in the regulations for a patients declaration and i can tell the noble lord that her majestys stationery office will continue to print and supply blank registration forms <e> <s> i hope that covers the point that he has raised <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate and the noble lord have again raised a point which i know causes them very deep concern <e> <s> not for a minute should i like them to think that the government do not share that concern <e> <s> however though i have listened with great sympathy to the arguments that they have put forward this evening and previously i fear that i cannot accept the amendment and i shall explain why <e> <s> but before doing so i wish to detain your lordships for a few minutes in order to remind you why the government brought forward the provisions in the bill which would enable marriages to take place in prison <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house be now adjourned during pleasure until ten minutes to eight <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord elton i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> in doing so i should like to express my personal thanks to your lordships for the courteous way in which our explanations of the complexities of this bill were received and my thanks also on behalf of the government to those of your lordships whose constructive comments and support for the principles of the bill we much appreciate <e> <s> perhaps i may briefly mention in particular the noble lord lord mishcon and the right reverend prelate the bishop of derby who made such helpful contributions to our debates and were generous enough to withdraw an amendment in the light of assurances from the government to clarify a point of principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all those who have spoken for the kind remarks that they have made <e>", "<cs> i have listened with care to the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i have also <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to respond to the noble lord on section <e> <s> the noble lord has <e>", "<cs> my lords it now falls upon me to indicate the governments attitude to the bill <e> <s> before doing so i should like first to thank and congratulate my noble friend lady trumpington for her clear and helpful explanation of the bills intentions <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will agree that with her experience on the bench as a former licensing justice she is particularly well qualified to present a measure of this kind <e> <s> i am also grateful on her behalf as well as for the government for the support that the bill has received from the benches opposite and from my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord boston of faversham that this is a suitable topic on which the house can break up for easter <e>", "<cs> my lords experience has shown that not only the owner-managers of small businesses but also the bank managers accountants and solicitors to whom they often turn for advice are

nor to withdraw from their bilateral arrangements or international obligations under world meteorological organisation conventions to which they are signatories <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposal in front of the united states is to transfer some civil remote-sensing satellites to the private sector <e> <s> i have no doubt however that all public sector activities in the united states are kept under review just as they are in this country but the united states is not dismantling or selling off any part of what amounts to its international obligations in any way that will affect us at all

before the current arrangements were introduced in <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that all of us share the sympathy which the noble baroness lady jeger has expressed for those who died in all the wars

the government would like to be able to offer a visit at public expense to all the close relatives of servicemen buried overseas <e> <s> the simple fact is that this is a matter of scale and of

these relate to servicemen who died before the current arrangements for visits were introduced in <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not have an estimate of the cost but i can say that it would be a very large sum <e> <s> but i have no doubt that my right honourable friend the secretary of state will take note of what has been said by my noble friend lord onslow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful

comparatively close to hand and others are a lot farther away <e> <s> so it is not a question of simple mathematics <e>", "<cs> my lords when the original arrangements were made that is to say the arrangements the then under-secretary of state of defence for the army said that the new arrangements would not be retrospective and that in cases of impracticability and in some cases it would be impossible it would not necessarily be possible to arrange visits <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the misuse of drugs act modification order a draft of which was laid before this house on th

the arrangements for joint decision are perfectly satisfactory and do not require supplementing or confirmation by some other means <e> <s> furthermore all dual key control systems have been based on the ownership and operation of the weapons systems involved apart from the warhead <e> <s> such ownership carries with it the appropriate costs <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord belstead has said on many occasions the use of weapon systems operating from united states bases in the united kingdom is governed by the understanding on joint decision-making between the governments of the united kingdom and the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation remains as has been described <e> <s> the agreement still exists <e> <s> the agreement is satisfactory and the noble lord is incorrect when he talks about such a short flight time <e>", "<cs> my lords that is in fact another question <e> <s> however as i understand it the situation then was that we had to buy the missiles

exactly the same arrangements and they are subject in use to joint decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made clear on many many occasions in your lordships house and elsewhere exactly how

natos collective defence <e> <s> it is inconceivable that a united states president would act against the wishes of the british government in the use of these bases <e> <s> any reasonable approach to

last session <e> <s> the reversion to the historic method from what was known as the forecast method was in order to improve the accuracy by which these matters could be determined <e> <s> had we kept the forecast method in existence it could have been the case that we might have had to ask pensioners to pay back the amount that was overpaid when the last increase was made <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness will know the pensioners price index covers only pensioner households in which at least three-quarters of the total income is from state pensions or benefits and the pensioners price index covers less than two-fifths of retired persons <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the letter which the noble lord has received from my noble friend lord trefgarne but it is the case that if there is an adjustment to be made next year that will <e>", "<cs> my lords supplementary benefits were increased on the basis of the movement in the rpi excluding housing costs <e> <s> this was because the housing needs of people on supplementary benefit are met separately in addition to the scale rates <e> <s> as the noble baroness will be aware these rates were increased when i repeated the statement the week before last <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course the government always keep an eye on the index to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> but the full range of improvements which were stated in the announcement which i repeated the week before last will cost billion in a full year and will mean that our social security programme will cost billion in <e> <s> to give the noble lord some idea of what that means i would point out that it is equivalent to paying about for each man woman and child in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i understand it the noble lord is quite wrong in the figures that he has produced but of course if he is correct i will certainly write to him though i repeat that so far as i understand it he is quite wrong <e> <s> the noble lord will also be aware that in the labour party of which he is a member when in government changed from the historic method to the forecast method in other words to the method which is the other way to the way that we are now doing it as in those days inflation began to fall below per cent <e> <s> this helped reduce the november uprating from per cent to per cent <e> <s> which saved million on pensions equivalent to billion at todays prices <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that is a totally different question <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not actually set a date because setting a date could put unhelpful pressure on authorities to move children before adequate alternative provision has been made <e> <s> we want to see children in more appropriate care which is suited to their needs <e>

they should be penalised and that is why the joint finance arrangements are going to be helpful and in my view are encouraging <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the attendance allowance is concerned a change in the regulations has been under consideration for some time to remove the difference as soon as funds can be made available <e> <s> in reply to a written question in another place on thursday

voluntary bodies and government help to them the pound for pound scheme under which we allocated million over four years to match money raised by voluntary bodies has already led to four successful bids totalling and involving the removal of about children from hospital <e> <s> there are a number of other applications in the pipeline <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i fully accept what the noble baroness says <e> <s> there will always be some children unfortunately who need continuous health care but of course consideration is being given the whole time to trying to keep people out and not having to remove them once they are there <e>", "<cs> my lords earlier this year we launched a scheme making million a year available for three years to help health authorities with special problems make better provision in the way in which my noble friend suggests that is to say making better provision for children who need continuous health care <e> <s> the scheme is designed to get mentally handicapped children in hospitals more appropriately placed and to encourage districts which at present have no provision of their own for children to set up small homely units <e> <s> so far there have been bids for this money and we hope to announce approval of the first successful scheme shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot undertake that the government will agree to an amnesty such as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> the regulations will apply from august but they will not have retrospective effect and any parent who is aware that he or she has received an overpayment of attendance allowance should tell the department <e> <s> of course the department has a duty to seek repayment of overpaid benefits to protect public funds but the noble lord i think might bear in mind that many parents have notified us of these periods in which they were not entitled to payment <e> <s> however i know that this is a sensitive problem <e> <s> even when repayment is required not all cases are pursued for instance where there is financial difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the details that would enable me to give a specific answer to the noble lord but i am quite certain that research is being carried out the whole time in the way in which he suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a fact that successive governments have taken the view that our social security system is designed primarily for people living in this country <e> <s> the cost of increasing pensions falls mainly on contributors and employers here and it would by unreasonable to ask them to bear the cost of increases paid to people who have left the country <e>", "<cs> my lords that depends on the rules which apply in the country in which they live <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has asked me about the civil service and the armed forces <e> <s> so far as i am aware and if i am wrong i shall let her know the same situation applies as that which i have already described <e> <s> so far as

lords i am sure that my right honourable friend will take note of what the noble lord says <e> <s> but not all countries meet the kind of conditions that would warrant making a reciprocal agreement <e> <s> for example the social security schemes in the united kingdom and the other countries concerned have to be sufficiently similar for agreement to be practicable <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not agree that it is iniquitous <e> <s> what the noble lord must bear in mind is that many people abroad also receive a pension awarded by the country in which they have chosen to live so that their british pension is not their only source of income <e> <s> so far as canada is concerned to which the noble lord referred the government are aware of the concern felt by some british pensioners in canada and consideration is being given to whether there is any scope for improving the position within current financial constraints <e> <s> but no forecast can be made at present about whether any change might result from this consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the total cost of paying pension increases in countries where they are not at present payable would be million a year at the rates due to come into effect next november <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord must have misheard me <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be glad to know as i think i said earlier that

pounds notes which are in circulation were being replaced by coins <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be appropriate for me to go into any details about how the mint or anybody else distinguishes a counterfeit coin from a real one <e> <s> however i can tell the noble lord lord winstanley that part of the coin is designed in such a way as to defeat the type of thing to which he refers <e>", "<cs> my lords a pound for each pound exchangeable <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not had time to experiment with the coin that i was given before lunch but i can tell my noble friend that if the coin had a hole in the middle which my noble friend lord massereene suggests it would probably make even less of a clink <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give my noble friend an answer <e> <s> no decision has yet been reached as to when the pound note will be taken out of circulation <e> <s> however her points will certainly be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords it was considered at a time when as the noble lord is aware unfortunately and i know that it is very sad the pound became a much lower value unit than it had been hitherto <e> <s> furthermore many other countries including germany france and sweden have coins of similar value <e> <s> it was during that time and during the time we have been able to look at other coins that we have seen that there has been a need to introduce a coin to replace the note <e>", "<cs> no my lords the abatement was made to achieve savings in public expenditure as well as in anticipation of taxation <e> <s> we reviewed the position when the benefit came into tax as we had undertaken in the light of the resources available and competing priorities <e> <s> taking those factors into account we decided that we could not make good the abatement at last years uprating we can do so from this november but not retrospectively <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we do not intend to back-date the making good of the abatement <e> <s> that would be contrary to the intention to make savings and furthermore the administrative problems it would raise would be enormous <e> <s> in discussion on the bill in it was repeatedly stated that the level of benefit once it was brought into tax would have to be considered in the light of the prevailing economic circumstances and that is precisely what we did <e> <s> resources and priorities simply did not permit us to make good the abatement of unemployment benefit until this year <e>", "<cs> my lords all i was explaining to the noble lord which i think he knows perfectly well was that there were competing priorities and this was one area where it was thought that it was necessary to make a specific cut <e> <s> it has not been possible to restore the abatement until next november for the reasons which i thought i had explained just now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly not responsible for what is written in the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend puts his finger on the point very fairly and firmly <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned the decision to abate the increase in short-term benefits was made in when we had to curb the <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that is a rather different question <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree that this is a very complicated matter <e> <s> whether or not there will be time for a debate on it is a question for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords up to the moment it has not proved possible to identify exactly what is causing the disease <e> <s> until that has happened i am afraid i could not say that we can produce a cure <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer concerning dental surgeons specifically but the mechanisms by which the disease is transmitted and the causative agent as i have described to the noble baroness are not known <e> <s> although promiscuous male homosexual activity and intravenous drug abuse are risk factors there is no evidence that the disease can be transmitted through non-physical contact <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer concerning the chemical to which the noble baroness referred <e> <s> i shall find out and let her know <e> <s> we have to import factor viii which is an agent used in the cure for haemophiliacs <e> <s> we shall need to continue to do that until we are self-sufficient ourselves <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i will do that <e>", "<cs> my lords we need to import it because we have not got enough ourselves <e> <s> we are trying to build up our own stocks <e> <s> the noble baroness might like to know that last year the blood products laboratory manufactured million international units of factor viii <e> <s> at the same time we imported million international units in at a cost of between million and million <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend to the noble lord lord wallace and to the noble lord lord winstanley for their views and comments <e> <s> the new mental health review tribunal rules are the result of a thorough review of the mental health review tribunal rules which apply at present <e> <s> the new rules also reflect recent legislative changes made in the mental health amendment act now consolidated in the mental health act <e>", "<cs> my lords i can perhaps come back to the noble lords question when i have a reply <e> <s> i do not know it off the top of my head <e> <s> i was saying that my noble friend lord mottistone gave me warning of what the national schizophrenia fellowship had briefed him on <e> <s> i shall take in turn the points made in the note which are the source of my noble friends concern <e> <s> the first is that there is no longer a form prescribed for giving notice of proceedings to the patients nearest relative and other interested parties <e> <s> it is also suggested that the nearest relative should be encouraged to indicate whether any written representations he makes are confidential <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady macleod has spoken with her usual eloquence about a matter which concerns her greatly i am grateful to her for her remarks and for the remarks of all those other <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the comments of the noble baroness lady jeger and the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> as regards the choice in reality which was referred to by the noble baroness lady jeger i can confirm that will be a choice in reality <e> <s> i have every confidence that health authorities will act responsibly about this very important matter of choice <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the survey was conducted at the hospitals where male midwives have been practising and husbands were consulted and found this agreeable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the social security benefits up-rating order be approved <e> <s> the order is accompanied by a report by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the comments which your lordships have made on the various orders i have described <e> <s> there are a number of points to answer and i will do my best to answer them although not necessarily in the order that they came to me <e> <s> i hope i shall be able to answer as many points as possible <e> <s> the noble baroness lady jeger asked about the three tiers for board and lodging and about the rates payable to those in hostels for alcohol and drug misusers <e> <s> in fact charges made in such hostels cover both board and rehabilitation costs <e> <s> the latter element is a matter for local authorities although residents in such hostels will qualify for the extension of a week which is available to certain categories of patients <e> <s> i hope that information meets that particular point <e> <s> i am advised that the question of adult hospitals is outside the scope of the regulations i have described <e> <s> if i am advised incorrectly i will write to the noble baroness but i understand that the regulations do not cover the particular point which she mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have got it wrong then of course i apologise and i will write to the noble baroness <e> <s> but as i understood the point she made this is not in fact covered by the regulations <e> <s> the noble baroness asked about hardship and the question of voluntary unemployment <e> <s> there were really three areas that were touched on in connection with voluntary unemployment <e> <s> when someone has family responsibilities the deduction is considerably less than per cent <e> <s> of total benefit income <e> <s> the deduction is applied only to the claimants scale rate leaving the amounts paid for wife or children intact and housing benefit is also unaffected by the deduction <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady jeger and the noble lord lord winstanley for their remarks even if they are not altogether pleased with what they think the statement contains <e> <s> first may i say to the noble baroness opposite that many of the questions she asks will become much clearer when she has time to study the report more fully <e> <s> i appreciate the administrative arrangements which lead to the report reaching her hands rather late in the day <e> <s> nevertheless i think it will become much clearer to her when she does read it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that request which i note is really a matter for the usual channels <e> <s> i am sure they will take note of it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is the whole point of the system <e> <s> the idea of filling the national health service with administrators who do not directly affect patient care but indirectly affect patient care has been discussed widely over the last few months as the noble lord lord kilmarnock knows <e> <s> if we can achieve efficiency here in the way that the griffiths report recommends then the results of that would go directly towards the patient <e>", "<cs> my lords these are all matters to be taken into account when the composition of the board is further discussed <e> <s> as i think i made clear the secretary of state is considering non-executive appointments and whether or not the general <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness asked the question which was asked by the noble baroness lady jeger about the payment of general managers and whether they will be paid more and how they will be paid <e> <s> the answer is that we have got to look at what general managers in the district do when appointed and consider then in fact whether they should be paid more because they will be coming anyway from an existing function <e> <s> it is a point that has not yet been firmly sorted out but it will be <e> <s> so far as matrons are concerned the suggestion made is something i would rather like myself though i am speaking entirely personally <e> <s> i do not think that that point has been covered by the report <e> <s> the professional functional responsibility of functional managers such as nurses is not decreased <e> <s> a unit director of nursing services for example would continue to manage the nursing staff within the budget and would be responsible for their professional competence <e> <s> the general management function will tighten up the environment within which the professional managers work clarify where professions may be at cross purposes and ensure that sensible decisions are taken <e> <s> however i think that the appointment of a matron is rather a different story <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i can confirm that there was a general election on th june as the noble lord asks <e> <s> so far as concerns his charge about knowledge of the increase in the public sector borrowing requirement i can say that as he knows spending has been higher than expected and this was the main reason why my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer made reductions in the cash limits and announced them on th july <e> <s> he included among them the fact that there was to be extra spending on social security benefits largely because of the higher rates of take-up of supplementary benefit and agricultural support <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the treasury monitors the progress of the psbr throughout the financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i am not entirely sure of the legislation to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> i can say however that so far as letting parliament see forecast profiles is concerned this is something which as he probably knows has been recommended by the procedure committee in respect of finance <e> <s> the government are considering this and other recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be a mistake to get drawn now into a debate on health service cuts to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> but the fact is that the forecast of the public sector borrowing requirements at the time of the budget was billion the outturn was billion <e> <s> the under-forecast of the central government borrowing requirements own account element of the public sector borrowing requirement was billion <e> <s> the remainder was on the local authority borrowing requirement <e> <s> that may not entirely answer the noble lords question but i hope that if he wants further information on how that difference is made up i can give it to him in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords once estimates have been made it is very important that they be controlled and that costs and all those other elements which go towards the financial structure of the country are maintained by proper management by proper organisation and where possible by proper forecasting <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course is a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords this would really be more a matter for my right honourable friend the secretary of state and my right honourable friend the prime minister to decide but i think there is a risk that it would in fact devalue to some extent the importance because many other people could also lay claim to a specially labelled minister if i may use those words <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i shall do all that i can to do what the noble and learned lord says <e> <s> the government have made it perfectly clear that they attach great importance to health authorities establishing locally what is best in the full field of mental illness <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the point that the noble baroness is making but we have consistently expressed the view that voluntary organisations also have a very important part to play in this field <e> <s> the provision of comprehensive local services requires the co-operation and collaboration of health authorities local authorities and voluntary bodies <e> <s> there are various voluntary bodies in the field and i have spoken to most of them as part of my present responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for his kind remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her encouragement <e> <s> the mental health commission under the leadership of my noble friend lord colville of culross is indeed in being <e> <s> it is at present working out its own terms of reference within departmental guidelines <e>", "<cs> not off the top of my head my lords but i will find out and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we will take it seriously <e> <s> the noble lord might like to know that the chairman of the group which produced the report the noble earl lord longford is coming to talk to me on th november to discuss the conclusions and recommendations of the report but the governments consideration of the report in its entirety is not yet complete <e> <s> it is probably best to discuss it first with those who produced it <e>", "<cs> no my lords i entirely disagree with the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> the programme for any closure of hospitals is reviewed regularly by ministers when they have their review meetings with the regional health authorities <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord is not suggesting that some of the very large and pretty hideous and very expensive to run victorian mental health institutions should be kept in being when they are not strictly necessary <e> <s> the whole point is to try to get people back into the community if at all possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords view runs quite contrary to the views that have been expressed to me on the many visits i have made to mental institutions all round the country during the last three or four months <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered that when i spoke to an earlier supplementary <e> <s> we recognise what the noble lord says and we will consider it in its entirety <e> <s> the government are at the moment looking at the report and will produce a view on it in due course <e>", "<cs> however there is a link between numbers of elderly people and demands on the health service <e> <s> at present patients over already represent a quarter of cases in the acute specialties and per cent <e> <s> of the occupied beds <e> <s> yet an increase of per cent <e> <s> in the numbers of those aged is forecast for the next years <e> <s> the most recent provisional forecasts suggest that even larger increases may occur perhaps over per cent <e> <s> all these facts are quite crucial to any discussion of the future of the national health service <e> <s> this factor of age was brought home to me very forcefully at first hand yesterday when i visited guys hospital and saw some of the patients on the medical wards there <e>", "<cs> my lords am sorry to interrupt the noble lord lord graham of edmonton while he is in full flow but he really should accept that many of the decisions which have to be made are just as agonising for the minister who has to make them <e> <s> the fact remains at the end of the day that decisions come forward from the local authority <e> <s> and it is on the basis of local decisions that recommendations come forward to ministers <e> <s> it is for that reason that such decisions have to be taken and why they come before ministers to make the final choice at the end of the day <e> <s> it is unfair of the noble lord to suggest that it is only the local area which feels concern the minister feels it very much as well <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer the government consider that this is very much a matter for individual consciences <e> <s> however the noble lord spoke about the numbers of people in the general synod of the church of england who voted for it <e> <s> he may like to be aware that of the or so members of synod who could have voted only did leaving who did not even attend <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the first point which the noble lord lord winstanley made <e> <s> so far as his second supplementary is concerned yes there is scope for both the private sector and the public sector <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i reject what the noble earl says <e> <s> it is not the case that the act is being widely abused <e> <s> the statistics which come to the department would verify that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the vote in synod was for two against with abstentions <e> <s> a further did not vote <e> <s> i think that answers the noble lords supplementary <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the chief difficulties about dealing with a matter like this is that it is an extremely emotional one <e> <s> all noble lords will have their own personal views <e> <s> that is why the government maintain the view that it is best to leave this matter to individual conscience <e> <s> they believe that the abortion act was a great improvement on what existed hitherto as the noble lord lord winstanley explained so well just now <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the right reverend prelate says about the attendance at any one time of people given any particular opportunity to vote but i cannot promise that the government could give any time for such a bill <e> <s> in any case that would be a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords that might be a question better addressed to the right reverend prelate on my left <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of abortions is something which the government certainly keep under review <e> <s> so far as late abortions specifically are concerned if the noble lord would like to elucidate the point further at a later date or write to me perhaps i could take an interest in the matter because i have a certain responsibility towards it <e> <s> but i have no other facts to put in front of the noble lord today <e>", "<cs> my lords without notice i simply do not know the answer to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i repeat what has been said in your lordships house on an earlier occasion that is that the government share with the noble lord lord kennet and those other noble lords who have spoken this afternoon the repugnance with which he views the practice of female circumcision <e> <s> i hope that that satisfies to some extent the views of the noble baroness lady gaitskell <e> <s> it is something that has no place in our society and we would never wish it to become accepted among any part of our population <e> <s> that i believe is a view shared also by those who speak for the minority communities in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that i am not in a position to speak with authority on the law in the same way as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept that <e> <s> the fact remains that it is no good trying to prosecute someone if one does not know what has been done <e> <s> i do not think we can take this argument much further as i would need to seek legal advice on this point <e> <s> the noble and learned lord was making a particular point in referring to excision of one part of the anatomy only <e> <s> if the noble lord looks that up he will see what was said <e> <s> we understand that it was considered by the director of public prosecutions but insufficient evidence was available to take action on the particular case to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable friend and honourable friend will note what the noble lord says <e> <s> the government are always willing to hear and consider the views of national health service trade unions on matters of mutual concern but as the noble lord will know at the end of the day it is for the government to make up their mind on health policies <e>", "<cs> no my lords that will not i fear be possible <e> <s> as the noble lord knows the manpower targets for achievement by st march have already been settled with all regional health authorities in england <e>", "<cs> my lords the national health service unions not affiliated to the tuc if they are what the noble lord is referring to do meet ministers from time to time and they account for about people <e> <s> so far as the community health councils are concerned i believe that my honourable friend the minister of health is going to see them today <e>", "<cs> my lords i really think that i answered the noble lords question when i spoke earlier <e>", "<cs> that is another question my lords and we have already debated the nhs at some considerable length last week <e>", "<cs> my lords firm information is hard to come by <e> <s> but it is clear that the ceasefire in <e>", "<cs> my lords indonesia has certainly sent extra troops to east timor but as the noble lord himself made clear estimates of the number vary <e> <s> it seems unlikely that operations have been extensive given the small number of active fretilin guerrillas involved and we would expect that military operations will have to end shortly when the rainy season begins <e> <s> as regards relief organisations yes i am aware and i am aware that my right honourable friend is aware of the situation concerning the icrc but it seems that a number of other relief organisations continue to operate in east timor and these include the united states catholic relief and unicef <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures to which the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos refers are his figures <e> <s> they are speculative <e> <s> of course we will continue to watch the situation closely but no grounds exist at present for formal representation <e> <s> the noble lord may like to know that we are in touch with the indonesian government and they are fully aware of our interest in this matter <e> <s> as regards arms sales this is a difficult matter <e> <s> many factors must be taken into account including the effect of such sales on employment in the united kingdom <e> <s> as the noble lord knows all sales require an export licence and each application is carefully considered <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be appropriate to adopt any arms embargo against indonesia <e> <s> we have excellent relations with indonesia <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not intend getting involved in any discussion about argentina which is the subject of another question altogether <e> <s> i have nothing to add to what i said earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to hear the noble lords anecdotes but i think there is evidence to support what i said that the coming of the rainy season should end these operations <e>", "<cs> my lords all i will say is that i am grateful to the noble lord for his general welcome to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his general welcome to the bill <e> <s> regarding the question of what the provision of oil does for the general state of the economy i do not think i need be drawn any further on that now except to say that the whole economic climate is vastly affected by all that is done in the way of production of north sea oil and that we shall use it to best effect <e> <s> i am also grateful for the noble lords generous tribute to those who work in the north sea <e> <s> i am sure those remarks will be welcomed by all who work in what i know from my own experience is a difficult and challenging environment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement that is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wallace of coslany raised a series of points not altogether welcoming what had been said in the statement <e> <s> first may i pick up the second from last point which he made about old-age pensioners <e> <s> the answer is that at present old-age pensioners are not exempt unless they qualify under the social security provisions <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear also asked about exemptions <e> <s> the answer is that all those who are presently exempt will continue to be exempt <e> <s> so far as the information contained in the <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a great deal of discussion in the medical profession about the provision of glasses <e> <s> the discussions have led us to believe that it is important for us to retain the free sight-testing which i described earlier <e> <s> there is of course divergence among the professional people involved as to exactly what sort of diseases are best found by those who look into these things <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned some and i am sure he is quite right <e> <s> the medical expertise in searching for these diseases will be maintained <e> <s> the provision of the actual lenses is a matter for a much more mechanical process in many cases and not quite so important as the sight testing which will remain <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention is that the duty to supply appliances will cease on st march <e> <s> however it is quite likely that opticians will continue to stock them if they are wanted but they will then have to be privately supplied <e>", "<cs> my lords at the present time anyone who wants glasses has to go to a registered optician to obtain the glasses prescribed but the intention of the legislation to be introduced will be that one will be able to get them over the counter that is the point but only following a recent assessment by an optician to satisfy both himself and the person needing the glasses that that person needs such a prescription <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a figure off the top of my head to answer the noble lords first point but of course advertising will help to lower prices in three main ways <e> <s> first of all the consumer will be able to choose the optician giving best value for money <e> <s> at present consumers can pay as much as more for the same prescription from different opticians <e> <s> advertising will also help the optician seeking to expand by offering a cheaper or quicker service <e> <s> at present it is hard for the optician offering better value to let people know that he is doing that <e> <s> thirdly advertising will help new keener opticians who want to start up on their own <e> <s> at present it is hard for them to tell the public what they offer that existing opticians do not offer <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the present arrangements are that while some lenses have to be specially cut the prescription houses hold stocks of the more regularly used lenses <e> <s> so i do not understand that there can be any question of anybody picking up second-hand lenses <e>", "<cs> my lords by introducing the form of competition which this system will allow spectacles will for some of the reasons i have described to the noble lord lord ross and others become cheaper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the point the noble lord lord donaldson makes about the fact that having the wrong sort of glasses does not do any damage to your eyes but merely means that you cannot see so well and in that case you obviously <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated earlier this is something which will have to be considered but there is no intention that there should be the sort of delay to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> i think it is something which has to be discussed with the expert bodies concerned and again when legislation goes through your lordships house and another place <e> <s> as i understand it there will be no difficulty in obtaining replacement glasses in the way the noble lord describes <e>", "<cs> my lords contact lenses can damage eyes if wrongly fitted <e> <s> we shall continue to limit contact lens fitting to qualified staff <e> <s> the same applies to children <e> <s> which is a point mentioned in the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords it would probably weary your lordships if i were to go through the entire weighty tome which is the report produced by the director-general of fair trading <e> <s> the important points which i have covered deal with the meat of the question which the noble lord asked <e>", "<cs> yes my lords now that we have studied and reported our views on the oft report that supersedes the report to which my noble friend refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i must agree with the noble lord when he says that the rules are complex complex they certainly are <e> <s> so far as his second point is concerned the change in the supplementary benefit rules did not take heating additions away from claimants who needed extra heating <e> <s> the only losers if that is the right word are people whose landlords provide full heating for a fixed charge <e> <s> in those cases that charge is fully reflected in the housing benefit they receive <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are spending well over million this year on extra help with heating costs for those most in need <e> <s> these supplementary benefit heating additions have just been increased in line with the increase in fuel prices to may of this year which was per cent <e> <s> and are now at their highest ever level in real terms <e> <s> they should as in the past be increased again next year in the light of increases in fuel prices to which the noble lord referred during the months ending may <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the answer to the last supplementary that the noble lord asked was covered when i answered his noble friend lord molloy <e> <s> to go to the first part housing benefit has of course resulted in a reduction in supplementary benefit payments to some people because their housing requirements are now met by the local authority <e> <s> although this may have meant that some claimants needed to make changes to their budgeting arrangements the introduction of housing benefit has <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i did not hear the last part of the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords not that i know but if there is one i shall let the noble lord have it <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> apart from anything else that is rather a different question <e> <s> i should say again to the noble lord that the sums of money which this government are spending are over million a year which are far higher than the sums spent by any previous government <e> <s> we introduced extensions to the criteria for the payment of heating additions in so that pensioners over or families with children under five and on supplementary benefit now get a heating addition automatically <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord is overstating the case <e> <s> the fact remains that those who lose out if that is a form of words which is acceptable to the noble lord are those who were in fact over-provided for in the first case <e>", "<cs> my lords that really is another question and i do not think it is one that i ought to go into now <e> <s> of course as i said just now the increases that take place in the prices in both the gas and electricity industries will be reflected in the rises that take place inline with inflation up to may next year <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we share the concern of all those who are worried about the effect that winter could have on the elderly and infirm <e> <s> if there is a form of words that can be used to make it more clear we shall consider it <e> <s> but i should not like to be drawn on whether or not there would be a change in the end <e>", "<cs> my lords if the phrase over-provided for is capable of misinterpretation <e> <s> i apologise <e> <s> i share the noble baronesss concern but the fact remains that those who have now lost in the way that i described were getting double treatment to some extent in what amounts to a complex area and one that i should be delighted to talk to the noble baroness about later or perhaps answer her in writing <e> <s> this is a difficult subject <e> <s> the fact remains that some people were receiving double benefit and that has now gone <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot without notice say categorically whether the figure that the noble lord quotes is right or wrong <e> <s> but any claimant whose fixed charge does not meet all his or her heating needs can still be considered for a heating addition under the normal rules <e> <s> indeed many claimants in this position are better off under the new arrangements than before because they can now get both heating additions from supplementary benefit and a further rebate of a percentage of the amenity charge as part of their housing benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly consider that and see what we can do to help <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are all grateful to the noble lord lord beswick for asking this question tonight <e> <s> when he started his speech the noble lord referred to the history of mental health as fascinating and moving and we have heard some fascinating and certainly some moving speeches tonight <e> <s> he is quite right in what he says that to the uninitiated in this field it often seems a sad and even distressing subject to become involved in and i must confess that to some extent i found this myself when i took up my present responsibilities <e> <s> but i have to say that i have also found a great deal to be encouraged about in the way that the mentally ill are looked after <e> <s> while i would be the last to say that there are no problems at all i do not think that the situation is quite as bleak as some noble lords have made out tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords the closure of some of these hospitals will lead to the repositioning if that is the right word to use of a great deal of cash which is tied up in hospitals which do not necessarily meet the requirements of the people who are in them <e> <s> to give an example of the kind of funds which will be made available from revenue a couple of weeks ago i visited one of the hospitals in surrey which is due to close in due course <e> <s> i believe i am right in saying that the figure i was quoted for heating alone was per patient per year <e> <s> that is a fairly staggering figure <e> <s> if it is possible to divert revenue which is being wasted in some respects in this way and to put it into the community it may be one way in which we can meet the noble lords requests <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend may be under some misapprehension <e> <s> the blood itself is not being charged for <e> <s> it is a handling charge as i think is now widely realised <e> <s> we believe that the independent sector should pay for the cost of services provided by the national health service <e> <s> there has been a rapid growth in the quantity of blood provided to private hospitals and a rising cost to public funds of handling and transporting it <e> <s> we have decided therefore that in line with other services offered to the independent sector it would be equitable and logical to make an economic charge to reimburse the regional health authorities for the cost of collecting processing handling and transporting blood and blood derivatives <e>", "<cs> my lords if they are getting blood at private hospitals it is for them to pay and/or to take the matter up with their insurance companies if that is the way they deal with these things <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can comment on the question of a grant in the way the noble baroness has described it but i can say that we would certainly do everything in our power we have already done quite a lot to make plain to the public at large that we are not charging for blood but merely for the handling of it which i described just now <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not importing blood <e> <s> we are self-sufficient in whole blood but we need to import blood products such as factor viii to which i think the noble lord was referring <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the apprehensions to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> i am quite sure that my right honourable friend will note what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords the national blood transfusion service is equipped and has the expertise to meet all demands for blood and provided we make the optimum use of all the blood received there should be no need for private panels <e> <s> the introductions of such panels which i think is what the noble lord lord wigoder is suggesting whether voluntary or paid could only be detrimental to the services own voluntary system <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can give the noble baroness that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords the precise level of charge is so far not fixed <e> <s> we shall be discussing this together with the operative date when it will come into effect with representatives of the national health service and the private sector but we anticipate that the handling charge per unit of whole blood will be around <e> <s> that is just a projected figure at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall wait until i see whether the noble lord is prepared to deliver some and then i will see what arrangements can be made <e>", "<cs> i think it might be a convenient moment to break for dinner on this bill until a quarter-past nine <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure to which advertisement the noble lord is referring <e> <s> if he will show me any particular advertisement which he thinks is distasteful i shall certainly take up the matter with those concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am convinced that the region will agree with the noble baroness lady robson of kiddington who suggested that patients should not be moved more than once when it comes to their turn and it is suitable for them to move into community care <e> <s> this is a very important point which i am quite certain will be strictly adhered to wherever possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the general welcome which both noble lords have given to the statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord wallace asked about the refund of past excessive profits <e> <s> the pprs provides for excess profits to be recovered either by rebate or by price reductions <e> <s> there have been refunds or excessive profits in the past and in fact a cheque for over million was received from one company only yesterday <e> <s> so i hope that the noble lord is satisfied on that account <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can tell my noble friend that of course the research aspect of the pharmaceutical industry is an important one and that it will not be affected in the way in which my noble friend fears <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am bound to say that i am not quite clear where the questions lay in what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> however he attempted to draw me on the question of prescription charges <e> <s> i think he ought to bear in mind and i am sure that other noble lords will as well that per cent <e> <s> of all prescriptions are in fact exempted from charges anyway whatever might have happened to the rise in prescription charges over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords on the second point which the noble lord lord kilmarnock has raised that is something that i should like to look at rather than respond to immediately <e> <s> on his first question about repayments for sales promotions yes the new proposal is that expenditure over limit would be repaid to the department instead of merely being treated as notional profit for assessing price increases and rebates for excessive profits <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i do not think that i ought to be drawn on what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i must start by saying that i do not have in front of me the figures in relation to the second part of my noble friends question but i shall certainly find out and write to him <e> <s> as regards consultations with the abpi these will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly grateful to the noble lord for the first part of his supplementary question when he referred to the efforts of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can give all the information for which the noble lord asks without notice but i shall find out what the figures are and advise him <e> <s> as regards any excessive cost on the premature retirement scheme this figure is about million <e> <s> the report from the comptroller and auditor general says that the original estimates were understated and this is not in fact in dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in my answer to the noble lords earlier supplementary question there is a difference between redundancies and premature retirements <e> <s> the figures i gave him earlier were for redundancies <e> <s> there were of course rather more for premature retirements <e> <s> the number is <e> <s> that greatly exceeds earlier estimates <e> <s> but the regional health authorities who were responsible for administering the premature retirement scheme <e> <s> were the only bodies in a position to judge how many were needed <e>", "<cs> my lords if the figure which i gave to the noble lord is wrong i shall of course let him know but i understand that that was the approximate cost of the reorganisation to which he refers <e>", "<cs> no my lords the figure of is for premature retirements and that followed reorganisation so it is not part of the figure to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has asked a general question about closures and i do not think that it would be proper for me to be drawn on detailed issues <e> <s> i am aware of the article to which he refers <e> <s> the document referred to in the article is nothing more than a simple working document illustrating the relationship between national health service resources and provision in certain parts of the north-west thames area <e> <s> before any strategic proposals can he implemented they must be the subject of full public consultation <e> <s> where proposals for changes in the use of hospitals are opposed locally the final decision will rest with my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i said just now in answer to my noble friend lord auckland that the government acknowledge the value of these hospitals <e> <s> i am not aware of the point concerning skegness <e> <s> of course health authorities are bound also to look at the cost of the service provided <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the last part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned i am afraid i cannot give him that answer without working it out which would take me more than a minute or two and i have not got the latest figures available <e> <s> so far as the district health authorities are concerned and their responsibility towards local hospitals it is of course health authorities themselves which have got to determine how services should be organised to get the best value from the available resources for all the communities they serve <e> <s> it is up to them to work out in consultation with all others concerned the pattern of services which best suits local needs <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice i am afraid but certainly there are plans to close some mental hospitals because as my noble friend will be aware they are consumers of a considerable amount <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that question goes rather wide of the narrow question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the health authorities concerned will take the point about ambulances into account before they reach any decision on the closure of hospitals <e> <s> but it is of course as i said earlier a matter for the district to decide how they should best use the resources which they have at their disposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with what the noble lord says <e> <s> the fact remains that there are representatives of the professions as members of regions and they of course express their views at regional meetings <e> <s> no doubt these are all taken into account when the district raises the possibility of closing a hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not particularly aware of the point at the place which my noble friend mentions but i entirely deplore that sort of attitude if it prevails <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady jeger and the noble lords lord banks and lord kilmarnock have raised a fair number of points <e> <s> i may not be able to cover all of them <e> <s> certainly the noble lord lord banks raised a great number of points which i should like to study and perhaps i may write to him about them <e> <s> the noble baroness lady jeger asked effectively why raise the contributions at all when the fund is in surplus <e> <s> as i hope i made clearwhen i spoke the class contribution rate is not in fact being raised nor is the class self-employed rate <e> <s> we are raising the upper earnings and profit making limits and the class rate because they are expressed in cash terms and need to be raised each year because the act requires them to be looked at in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness and to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for their comments <e> <s> i will try to answer as many of the points that they raised as possible <e> <s> the noble baroness asked particularly why we have based the ssp up-rating on the historic movement of prices <e> <s> in answering all these points i should say that i understand that she is thoroughly opposed to the scheme anyway but i do not think there is any point in going over that ground again <e> <s> as she will know and as i described both benefits and ssp are now up-rated by reference to the known movement of prices over the year just prior to the announcement of the new rates this is known as the historic method <e> <s> this was always the intended practice for up-rating ssp and it has been generally welcomed and is in line with other up-rating <e> <s> apart from anything else it means that one has a clear picture of what has happened as opposed to the rather haphazard way of guessing what might happen in the future which in the past has more often been wrong than right <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is the case <e> <s> there was a reduction in claims to benefit following the introduction of self-certification but this may be part of what is a general decline in claims since <e> <s> i will study the noble lords remarks in the <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt as the noble earl himself said when he introduced this debate that the primary issue before us is discrimination against disabled people <e> <s> understandably it has aroused a great deal of controversy and interest over recent months <e> <s> it is a very important issue and i welcome the opportunity that your lordships have had to consider it in some depth <e> <s> i have listened with a great deal of interest to the debate <e> <s> it has been a very good debate a balanced one and one that has been helped by much practical experience which has been aired by many noble lords who have taken part <e> <s> i should like particularly to pay a tribute to the noble earl lord longford and to my noble friend lord campbell of croy for introducing their bills <e> <s> as we have heard they are very different in content but both have the interests of disabled people very much at heart <e> <s> i am sure that all of us in this house share my very great respect for the very considerable contribution which both the noble earl and my noble friend have made over the years towards improving the quality of life for disabled citizens in our society <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends intervention <e> <s> perhaps that is something which i can consider afresh but i think i ought now to get on with the rest of my speech because there is quite a lot to cover <e> <s> of course the government want to see what real evidence there is <e> <s> the noble lord lord banks raised the question of research into discrimination <e> <s> we have looked at this but we see considerable difficulty in designing an effective protocol <e> <s> if however a researcher came forward with a proposal which seemed workable we would certainly consider it <e> <s> but one of the problems about research is the time it takes to get useful information from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot tell the noble baroness whether there was a bone specialist on the panel <e> <s> so far as an epidemic of fractures is concerned i do not think that that necessarily has to do with calcium deficiency <e> <s> the departments medical advisers have assured us that there would not be any measurable effect on anyone including the elderly if in the context of a varied diet which i think is important calcium was not added to flour <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said when i answered the original question all views will be taken into account <e> <s> i stress what i said in answer to the noble baroness that the medical advisers to the department have not come up with any conclusive proof that to remove the calcium would cause any great damage <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am only too well aware of that and also that other things including carrots are full of calcium <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can very well follow the noble earls question and the scientific jargon that he used <e> <s> i shall nevertheless study what he has said in <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> but there are methods of getting calcium into the body other than through eating bread with calcium in it <e> <s> i hope that this was the point that i managed to make when answering the earlier question <e>", "<cs> my lords milk is available in any case <e> <s> the noble baroness may like to know although i would not wish to go through the list now that there are a great many forms of food that contain calcium <e> <s> cheese milk fat fish and all sorts of other things are apparently full of calcium and in a normal diet meet the basic need for calcium <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that it does <e>", "<cs> my lord i cannot give an absolute date although i hope that it will be within the next few months perhaps by the spring <e> <s> i would not however like to be held down by that timetable <e> <s> the important matter to bear in mind is that the addition of calcium began in as a wartime measure when it was thought likely that milk and cheese the main sources of calcium in the diet were likely to become scarce <e>", "<cs> my lords where either party to a proposed marriage comes from abroad and particularly where he or she has a limited knowledge of the english language all superintendent registrars have been advised by successive registrars general to inspect a passport or other official travel or identity document in order to verify that the particulars in the notice of marriage have been given correctly <e> <s> this advice has been given since <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of pressing political issues as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> in the particular case to which the noble lord refers the london borough of camden has in fact apologised because what happened was an error <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of amending the practice <e> <s> the practice is necessary and has gone on since <e> <s> i said that in the particular instance in camden to which the noble lord lord brockway referred it was a mistake and it should not in that particular case have occurred <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i suppose it is in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords the definitive version of the classification was published by the world health organisation in geneva in under the title international classification of impairments disabilities and handicaps <e> <s> since then it has been translated into several languages and experiments in its application are being carried out in a number of countries <e> <s> it was also the basic definition used in the world programme of action for disabled people produced by the united nations at the end of the international year of disabled people and in the council of europes own document on <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot give my noble friend that assurance <e> <s> as my noble friend knows the problem of classification is somewhat complicated <e> <s> i could read out a full definition but it might be too lengthy <e> <s> however i can give my noble friend a copy of it <e> <s> perhaps i can illustrate the situation by an example <e> <s> if someone is short-sighted he has an impairment if his sight can be completely corrected by glasses then that is all he has an impairment <e> <s> if his sight cannot be completely corrected then he also has a disability <e> <s> if despite that the disability does not affect his life-style then he is only disabled and not handicapped <e> <s> if however he requires good sight to obtain the job that he would like then he is also handicapped <e> <s> i hope that example shows that it is not easy to make the classification for which the noble baroness asks <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot say that we can adopt that particular definition <e> <s> as i have said it is difficult to employ the classification to define a disabled population particularly for the purposes of legislation <e> <s> to say whether or not someone should have a particular disablement benefit will depend so much upon the individual his circumstances and if he is able and willing to make use of aids <e>", "<cs> no my lords they are not binding resolutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of many representations which have been made about the coin <e> <s> the fact remains that the main impetus for the introduction of the coin was the increasing treatment of the note as if it was a coin it is kept in tills it is not returned to banks by traders and so it is not possible to replace it with the frequency that is desirable in order to keep the note in proper condition <e> <s> as regards plastic notes as my noble friend will be aware <e> <s> the isle of man has recently introduced a plastic note <e> <s> evaluations by the bank of england suggest that plastic notes are not a suitable alternative to paper notes or in the case of the to the coin <e> <s> they are not as secure from forgery as paper notes <e> <s> for that reason we do not propose to go ahead with any idea on that line <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have as many l coins in my pocket as the noble baroness and i suggest that she invites her husband to change his coins for a note <e>", "<cs> my lords extensive consultations established a demand for the coin and in some anticipation of my noble friends question both yesterday and today i have conducted my own private survey round your lordships house and i have found that it is in favour <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that but at another time i could tell the noble lord a similar story in relation to the p piece which i think was introduced by his party when they were in government <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said no announcement has been made about the point at which the note will be removed from circulation <e> <s> however i think it is important to bear in mind that the fact that apart from anything else it costs quite a lot of money to keep the notes in circulation <e> <s> a note lasts for about months and a coin for about years <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot speak for the americans from this dispatch box <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has given me a substantial number of supplementary questions to answer but i shall endeavour to answer them <e> <s> so far as the administrative costs of the schemes are concerned i have to tell my noble friend that on very rough estimates and the estimates are not very precise the annual administrative costs of both the <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in answer to my noble friend the combining of these schemes has been looked at <e> <s> of course the government are prepared to help the unemployed in the ways in which they have already announced and which operate at present <e> <s> as i have said there are three schemes and those three schemes are in operation <e> <s> whether or not it would be sensible to merge them is something which has been considered and we have ruled that it would not be sensible to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said was that the annual administrative costs of both the msc and the supplementary benefits schemes are million and respectively <e> <s> the reason for the msc schemes costing what they do is that one applies to travel only that is to say the benefits that come from the job search scheme cost <e> <s> the other scheme the employment transfer scheme is the one which provides removal expenses as well and it costs considerably more <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i actually said that the whole thing was million or less than million but i shall certainly read what i said and if i got it wrong i shall write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no overlap because the dhss scheme applies to those who are on supplementary benefit <e> <s> not everybody who goes in search of a job is on supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is per cent <e> <s> but i do not think that the noble lords mathematics are right in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i said just now that it was mercury which came to the government with a proposal <e> <s> i do not believe that they so far as i know defeated anybody but if i am wrong i shall let the noble lord know

served by a private monoply if i heard his words correctly <e> <s> no my lords there are arrangements in both the bill and the draft bt licence to safeguard the telecom requirements of defence and national security <e> <s> for example clause of the bill empowers the government to issue directions to operators in the interests of national security for example to require bt to take such steps as

particular point in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i follow the noble lord and the point he was making but i stand by what i said about the sheer impracticability of trying to put or more licences before parliament every time a change has to be made or someone has to be licensed <e> <s> there are finite limits to the amount of work which can be undertaken <e> <s> i stand by what i said earlier but i shall study the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords again if i have the noble lord wrong i shall study it and comment by writing to him about it <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i can assure my noble friend that that will be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather wide of the point that my noble friend lord orr-ewing made and in the interests of time i should get on with some of the other points that have been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i told my noble friend just now that the government intend to publish a consultative document on what to do with the frequencies when they become available when -linetelevision goes <e> <s> no doubt he will be able to respond to that document when it appears <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is why i hesitated before getting involved with access charges which is the next section of my speech <e> <s> i know well of the noble earls interests and of the speech he made just now but if i may i shall cover access charges because they are important to the noble lord lord taylor and the noble lord lord mcintosh referred to them <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of both the points which the noble lord makes <e> <s> the fact remains that expert opinion is divided as to the extent to which lower alcohol intakes are harmful to the foetus and whether there is a threshold below which it is safe to drink at all <e> <s> but there is no doubt as the noble lord will know that alcohol passes from the expectant mother to the foetus <e> <s> regarding birth weight and what effect not drinking alcohol has on it the answer is that in general the less one drinks the better <e> <s> there is no denying that alcohol is harmful but nevertheless there are other reasons which i explained in my original answer which make it not necessarily correct always to condemn those who drink a little <e>", "<cs> my lords not off the top of my head but i think my noble friend knows the answer to that perfectly well herself <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i indicated when i answered the noble lords original question and his supplementary that drinking alcohol does not necessarily do a great deal of good in fact it can do harm <e> <s> however i also explained that to say out loud that any drinking produces dangerous results for babies also presents difficulties because it can lead to unjustified feelings of guilt and anxiety when a baby is born with some problem which might or equally well might not be due to alcohol consumption during pregnancy <e>", "<cs> my lords there are lots of reasons why women have less tolerance if that is the right word to alcohol than men <e> <s> so far as dissemination of knowledge is concerned the health education council in the light of their expertise in health education have been discussing with the department how best the state of knowledge can be passed on to those who need it <e> <s> i have with me and i shall put it in the library a new publication called <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can certainly give my noble friend that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that flies somewhat in the face of the recommendations of the royal college of obstetricians and the british peadiatric association <e> <s> nevertheless i shall make sure that they bear in mind what the noble baroness feels about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i shall be drawn any further by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i will take the noble lords suggestion to my right honourable friend to see what can be done <e> <s> the health education council has published the leaflet to which i have referred but the fact remains that at the end of the day it is up to the woman concerned whether or not she drinks alcohol <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure how to reconcile the noble lords views on what he feels about being pregnant with what others might feel about it <e> <s> nevertheless i am sure that others will take note of his view <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness will be aware a consultative document went out for consultation in march and replies were received by july <e> <s> the public response to that document gave no clear support for any of the proposals put forward <e> <s> as a result it has been necessary to re-examine the whole situation <e> <s> the noble baroness asked when an announcement could be made about the future of the grant <e> <s> all i can say is that an announcement will be made in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question for the consultations which the government are having at the moment and on which i cannot give a pronouncement <e>", "<cs> my lords in when the present rate of grant was fixed the national insurance contributions were flat-rated and since they have been related to earnings <e> <s> there have also been changes to and increases in other benefits so it is not really possible to make a direct comparison in the way that the noble lord asks <e> <s> i could perhaps turn his question round if i may <e> <s> one could ask how far would national insurance contributions have to increase to restore the value of the death grant and the answer to that is about p a week for the average earner <e>", "<cs> my lords to restore it to what it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not agree with all that the noble lord says <e> <s> there are many reasons which have to be taken into consideration by the

prisoners of war are concerned <e> <s> i can assure him that all he says will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i seem to remember hearing various attempts to explain whether in due course was the same as soon or whether soon was the same as in due course and i am afraid that i cannot go further than i have said <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the noble baroness but we are not talking specifically about female circumcision <e> <s> we are talking about legitimate surgical operations as well as female circumcision <e> <s> i thought that i had made that clear as had the noble lord

that the noble lord lord hatch also went to great lengths to explain <e> <s> the noble lord lord kennet and the noble lord lord hatch particularly <e>", "<cs> cruelty or harm is implicit in the custom or ritual in this particular sort of operation <e> <s> as i said this custom or ritual is implicit in the title itself since the term female circumcision has no precise anatomical significance <e> <s> what it does signify is the customary or ritual character of the acts to which it refers <e> <s> i submit that interference with that sort of custom or ritual is inherent in the basic purposes of the bill <e> <s> what we are saying is that these particular customary practices are not compatible with the culture of this country <e> <s> i do not see this as attacking any racial group on the contrary we are saying that girls and women living here should have the protection of the law against practices which whatever sanction they may enjoy in other countries are thoroughly repugnant to our way of life and this seems to be a view which has been expressed by the committee this evening <e>", "<cs> what i am saying is that of course as the noble lord lord kennet said we have seen the comments in the letter to which the noble lord referred we have examined them and they have been discussed by the government <e> <s> but we stand by the view that i had started to express and will continue to expound now <e> <s> i do not want our discussion to dwell at length on unnecessary anatomical or clinical detail but it is important that your lordships should know exactly what would happen if my amendment is not accepted <e>", "<cs> i can expand upon that at length <e> <s> the matter comes later in my speech but in essence the fact is that we are faced with the problem of defining abnormality and if i may i would like to come back to that particular point later on <e>", "<cs> i think that the matter is simpler than the noble lord lord hatch says <e> <s> we all seem to be agreed that female circumcision is a thoroughly unsavoury practice <e> <s> in effect we are saying we do not like you doing it anywhere in the world and we will do our best to stop it but we shall certainly not allow you to do it over here <e> <s> however although we say that we are not prepared to allow legitimate surgical operations of the sort i have described to be circumscribed by the law being changed in a

therefore that is not quite so bad as my noble friend might think <e> <s> so far as advertising is concerned my noble friend will be aware that the government like their predecessors have preferred to proceed by voluntary agreement with the tobacco industry <e> <s> this approach has been very successful in progressively reducing expenditure on cinema and poster advertising <e> <s> the current voluntary agreement expires on st march <e> <s> the reductions in that advertising to which i referred will have been respectively per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> by then <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be the last person to try to prevent the noble lord lord shinwell from smoking a pipe <e> <s> he is the living proof and he looks extremely well on it too that smoking does not kill everybody

good and interesting point <e> <s> i shall certainly make sure that the noble lords views are brought to the attention of those who produced the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept that all

of this government and of the government of which the noble lord was a part have had an effect <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the case in some countries but certainly there are other countries which show that the voluntary agreements we have had have been just as effective as in those countries which have introduced a ban <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree to some extent but only to a limited extent with my noble friend <e> <s> the fact remains that the government the noble lord lord ennals brought this out do realise that the cost <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right that in the end we shall all die of something but there are other financial facts which i think really are pertinent <e> <s> for example smoking accounts for nearly million lost working days each year and that certainly has an effect on the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords if i trespassed on that particular bit of ground i should be in very difficult trouble indeed and therefore i do not propose to follow the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take the suggestion of the noble baroness away with me and see what can be done about television programmes <e> <s> we are most concerned about the level of smoking among secondary school children and we are taking steps to combat it <e> <s> the government have over the past two or three years given the health education council an extra million to spend on educating the public especially children on the dangers of cigarettes and we are encouraging the council to maintain its efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely share the noble viscounts view as one who does not smoke <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is more to that question than meets the eye <e> <s> i should like a minute or two to think about it <e> <s> perhaps i may write to the noble lord and expand on it <e> <s> but the point is that the voluntary agreement we have had has been proving effective and the government do not propose to legislate against tobacco advertising or any other form of promotion in the way suggested by the noble lord lord ennals and others <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have made clear in my original answer so far as the last part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned that it has been agreed and the government have welcomed the decision to amalgamate the charing cross hospital medical school with the westminster hospital medical school <e>", "<cs> my lords documents have been issued by the victoria health authority but these have been of an informative nature setting out the context in which strategic proposals need to be developed <e> <s> the most recent of these which was issued in june last year mentioned that a variety of options had been the subject of public speculation including closure of one or more hospitals in the district the document made it clear that further consideration and discussion would be needed before proposals were issued for public consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord reads the answer in <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state and my right honourable friend the minister for health are of course in touch with the victoria health authority on these proposals <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lords claim that it is not aware of what is going on is the case at all <e> <s> for the longer term my right honourable friend the secretary of state awaits the strategic proposals now being developed by the victoria health authority for the future of health services for which that authority is responsible and also the strategic plan being prepared by the north west thames regional health authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asked if there were any firm plans to close westminster hospital and the answer that i gave was that there are no firm plans to close it but there are proposals that are being considered which may or may not include closure <e> <s> no decision has been taken <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i am not familiar off the top of my head with the proposals which the noble lord mentions <e> <s> i will of course look at them and if i can answer that question in writing i shall do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his comments about the amalgamation <e> <s> he asked one or two other questions and i may not be able to follow up all of them without reading what he said <e> <s> as regards the implication that the university grants committee was responsible for the so-called rationalisation of the london medical schools the answer is no not at all <e> <s> the proposals to combine some of the london medical schools into larger and more viable units were discussed by the university of london long before the reductions in funding referred to <e> <s> i note that despite the reduced level of funding the london medical schools were able to expand their intake by nearly per cent <e> <s> between and <e>", "<cs> my lords as i hope i explained earlier no firm decisions have been reached and therefore rumours will circulate as they always do <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but as i said there is sometimes also the problem of rationalising services within the national health service generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord bruce and lord diamond for their <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that that will be possible but i am sure that my honourable friend in another place will note the noble lords views <e> <s> only a small number could be chosen and so inevitably many applicants have had to be disappointed <e> <s> some of them were good and some of them were not so good <e> <s> but we are confident that we have chosen those experimental sites which give a reasonable mix to allow the freeport concept to be properly tested <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i made it clear when i repeated the statement that there are reasons which really preclude my going into why any particular port was not successful in its application <e> <s> i understand that there were two applications for the north-east <e> <s> newcastle airport and immingham are the two that would probably be in the area to which my noble friend referred but i do not think that i can be drawn any further about the reasons why any particular site was or was not chosen <e> <s> suffice it to say that my honourable friend when considering all applications took into account a great many factors and we believe that it was right in the end to choose the six that were in fact chosen <e>", "<cs> yes my lords consideration was given to this matter <e> <s> the isle of man freeport is being developed under existing freely available customs duty relief arrangements <e> <s> there is an agreement between the isle of man authorities and the united kingdom which requires a common approach to customs procedures and so the designation as such of a freeport will follow the introduction of legislation in the finance bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat in answer to my noble friend what i said to my noble friend lord gisborough these factors were taken into consideration <e> <s> it would be wrong of me and i expressed this when i repeated the statement to go into any detail about why either was chosen or why one was chosen and another was not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of course of the noble lords interest in the north-west <e> <s> as i have already explained i cannot really say any more about the reasons why any particular site was chosen <e> <s> but this is an experiment and if the experiment is successful then perhaps in due time it may be possible to have a freeport in the north-west <e> <s> however the isle of man is tied so far as i understand it to certain customs procedures in the rest of the united kingdom and that is why it will not be possible to designate the isle of man as such until the united kingdom has legislated in the finance bill <e> <s> i hope that that clears up the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not aware of any significant unemployment among general practitioners <e> <s> the evidence available to us is that unemployment among doctors in general is largely frictional and concentrated on junior doctors in the south-east where competition for hospital jobs is most intense <e> <s> as in other areas of medical employment openings may not be readily available where the doctor may prefer to live but that does not mean that openings are not available <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give my noble friend any facts so far as general dental practitioners are concerned <e> <s> i think that in my answer to lord molloys supplementary question i referred to unemployment among general practitioners and not just doctors <e>", "<cs> my lords when i answered my noble friend lady gardner i referred to the figures for dentists which are i think slightly different <e> <s> but the rate of growth in the number of family doctors in general practice has doubled in recent years and is now running at about per cent <e> <s> per annum and the overall average patient list size continues to fall <e> <s> at st october there were what are technically called unrestricted principals that is to say family doctors working in england and the overall average patient list size was <e> <s> the noble lord also asked about early retirement <e> <s> as regards that matter my right honourable friend the secretary of state is awaiting the outcome of some research which is being undertaken at present <e>", "<cs> of course my lords the government take seriously the employment of doctors but as i tried to indicate to the noble lord there is not the evidence to suggest that vast numbers of doctors are unemployed <e> <s> it is a local matter and is one that is generally considered to be frictional <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord lord molloy accepted that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on my noble friends views to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i think it is true to say that there are parts of the united kingdom which do not attract doctors in the same way as other parts do <e> <s> i believe that that touches on the point raised by the noble lord lord molloy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable friend will note what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords we have received a report from the social security advisory committee and comments from the local authority associations which were formally consulted about the proposals <e> <s> we have also received a number of other representations <e>", "<cs> my lords a very great number of representations have been made <e> <s> i do not have the full list in front of me now but i shall have it in front of me later on in the afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords a new district general hospital has been completed since at bodelwyddan in clwyd and major district general hospital developments have been completed on the sites of the royal gwent and st woolos hospitals in newport gwent <e> <s> the cost of these developments at current prices is about million <e> <s> in addition the new district general hospital at bangor in clwyd is virtually complete and will be opened in the spring and major construction is in progress on new hospitals at bridgend and llanelli and the redevelopment of existing hospitals at wrexham and morriston <e> <s> the estimated cost of these at current prices is million <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a good record but to be quite fair to the opposition i do not think that they necessarily had a very bad one <e> <s> major construction works can seldom be attributed solely to any particular government because they go through a process starting with identifying a need and running right through to commissioning and getting patients treated in the hospital <e> <s> in wales her majestys government have vigorously pursued the hospital building plans which they inherited and have pursued positive initiatives to improve services for the handicapped and the elderly and to develop regional services <e> <s> if a commitment can be judged in purely financial terms total expenditure on the national health service in wales this year is expected to be nearly million an increase in real terms of per cent <e> <s> on the spending plans we inherited <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely sure whether the figure that my noble friend gives is correct but certainly there are plans which indicate that the amount that has been spent by this present government has been in excess of what was inherited towards the end of the period of government of the party opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords what i can tell the noble lord is that the estimate in capital expenditure for this year is million and in it was million which was inherited from his governments time <e> <s> the noble lord asked me some other questions about the wrexham hospital <e> <s> perhaps he could repeat them <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the complications in answering a question about wales is that some of the answers which i have are written in the welsh language and some in english so i have to translate them back again <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord is not stretching me any further with my welsh pronunciation <e> <s> i think what the noble lord says is correct <e> <s> if he is in fact not correct and i am sure he is i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords they are in prices <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall repeat a statement which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady jeger and to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for their comments on the statement which i have repeated <e> <s> first perhaps i may deal with the questions asked by the noble baroness lady jeger <e> <s> the noble baroness queried whether or <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept what the noble lord lord stallard says about chaos and the way he has referred to it <e> <s> we have to contain public expenditure now <e> <s> we cannot necessarily contain it only in the future and therefore it is important that these adjustments are made now <e> <s> so far as the problems faced by local authorities are concerned what i have repeated this afternoon indicates that only two major changes are going to go ahead in april that is the change in the tapers and the non-dependant deductions <e> <s> that of course simplifies the matter for local authorities <e> <s> in any case our advice is that local authorities will be able to cope with the limited changes which are now being implemented <e> <s> this is commented upon by the management consultants who have been looking at the matter with local authorities and they are satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness asks about tapers <e> <s> she suggested if i understood her drift correctly that taking two slices at it would have the effect of increasing the work for local authorities <e> <s> the social security advisory committee made the recommendation that the taper changes should carry some transitional protection <e> <s> that is a recommen <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene briefly to say that i am advised that it is a matter of printing and nothing more complicated than that <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord monson will accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords first perhaps i may say to those noble lords who have so far taken part in the debate that the government of course entirely share the sentiments expressed by the noble baroness lady gaitskell <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i did not make myself audible to the noble baroness <e> <s> i should like to make it perfectly plain to all noble lords who have taken part that of course the government share the noble baronesss distaste for female circumcision <e> <s> what we are trying to do is not to allow female circumcision but not to disallow one or two simple procedures which are nowadays carried out or have been carried out for a number of years by doctors quite openly quite legitimately and quite sensibly <e> <s> that is the purpose of many of the discussions that we have had not just tonight but also during the committee stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there are currently about people in receipt of mobility allowance <e> <s> the estimated annual cost of the benefit is approaching million <e> <s> this government brought the to age group into mobility allowance in earlier than had been planned previously helping more people <e>", "<cs> my lords the report has been received and has been circulated to interested organisations for comment <e> <s> the recommendations made in the report will be considered in the light of the comments which we receive <e> <s> as far as delays are concerned it might appear that there have been delays but that has been due to the fact that there have been many more claimants rather than because any claim has been held up for other reasons <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i have listened with care to what noble lords opposite have said <e> <s> if i can first of all pick up the point made by the noble lord lord mcintosh about the man-hours that of course refers to charges it does not refer to the practicability of provision <e> <s> nor does the amendment itself relate to reasonableness of demand it relates specifically to the reasonable practicability and those are separate things <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord bruce will accept that <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> condition refers to one or two other things including reasonableness of demand <e> <s> lord bruces argument does not strictly relate to the condition of practicability which the amendment specifically refers to <e>", "<cs> i do not think that is the point at all if the noble lord will forgive me <e> <s> we are trying to put into the new act exactly the same facts about reasonable practicability of physical provision as exist under the act <e> <s> so the situation is exactly the same there will not be any particular difference as far as that is concerned <e>", "<cs> before we go any further perhaps i may explain that condition to which the noble lord lord bruce referred and which the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon also mentioned applies to services other than voice telephony services <e> <s> i know that noble lords opposite are concerned about the provision of a telephone the basic instrument and that is covered in condition which makes it perfectly plain that <e>", "<cs> the question of prices for rural services in the future is clearly a matter which particularly exercises many of your lordships <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh described himself as a dyed-in-the-wool inhabitant of the metropolitan area i think that that is roughly right and i suppose that i ought to declare myself as a dyed-in-the-wool inhabitant of a rural area <e> <s> however i hope that i shall be able to explain the proposals that are contained in the bill a little more fully <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord reads the bill he will see that clause imposes a duty upon the secretary of state and that duty is far stronger than anything which has existed hitherto <e> <s> that was the point that i was going to make at the end of my remarks but i have now made it rather sooner <e>", "<cs> on the first question which the noble lord lord donaldson raised the fact is that at the moment the service as such is under-used <e> <s> i hope that i made that plain in my opening remarks in answering the amendment <e> <s> at the moment telephones of residential subscribers are not used a great deal and therefore it would not help bt or anyone else to increase charges in such a way that the system is used even less <e> <s> i hope that that makes sense <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord could remind me of the other point he raised because i have forgotten it <e>", "<cs> the question of competition in rural areas is a matter on which i touched <e> <s> the fact remains that certainly for the foreseeable future british telecom will be the main provider of services and competition will emerge in due course <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies on his point about general discrimination <e> <s> i would hesitate to argue if it is a very technical legal point but as i understand it in this amendment we are talking about general discrimination <e> <s> i am advised that the amendment as written would have the effect that i described <e> <s> for that reason apart from anything else i do not think that it would be sensible to allow the amendment in the form suggested <e> <s> my noble friend lord hawke cited an example of being able to complain to the postmaster general in the case of post not arriving <e> <s> when this bill becomes an act my noble friend will have a contract of service and i submit to him that that will be much more effective than what exists at the present <e>", "<cs> i think that the question of charges as they stand at the present time is a matter for british telecom and not for me <e> <s> but the principle of extending the use of a system in order to derive the best financial benefit from it is a perfectly sound one and that is what the bill will achieve <e>", "<cs> the question of electricity is entirely different and not a matter upon which i shall get drawn now <e>", "<cs> your lordships have raised a number of points <e> <s> perhaps i may start with the easy one first <e> <s> my noble friend lord morris asked about the licensed area <e> <s> i should refer him to condition of the licence where the interpretation is <e>", "<cs> what i said when i started to speak earlier was that the government recognise the concern that people have about the effects of the bill on rural areas <e> <s> what i have tried to do and i may not have done it as successfully as i might have done was to explain that they need not be concerned because for the first time in legislation clause imposes a duty to <e>", "<cs> this amendment would alter the duty imposed on the secretary of state and the director under clause in a subtle but important way <e> <s> the demand for telecommunication services can be measured with reasonable precision <e> <s> for example one can identify how many people are prepared to meet the extra cost of a more sophisticated and versatile domestic telephone <e> <s> our intention is that those licensed to run telecommunication systems should respond vigorously and efficiently to the demands of the market <e>", "<cs> i shall be the first person to endorse everything which my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said in response to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and his comparison of this service with the national health service <e> <s> i do not think i can add a word to what my noble friend said he made the point admirably <e> <s> i must also disappoint the noble lord lord bruce of donington and say that i am not going to give up i am going to continue with it <e> <s> although the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge referred to the difference between needs and reasonable as being very narrow again that makes the case for not accepting the amendment very strong <e> <s> in that case i cannot see what is the point of pushing the amendment in the way in which noble lords opposite seek to do <e> <s> the fact remains that demands is measurable <e> <s> needs in the way that the noble lord lord bruce of donington and others have described it effectively means an open-ended <e>", "<cs> there is certainly no disagreement between us over the need for telecommunications operators to research into and apply new techniques <e> <s> we all know that telecommunications is an extremely fast-changing technology and it is essential for united kingdom operators to keep in the forefront of technological developments and to reflect these in their services and apparatus <e> <s> this is why subsection <e>", "<cs> this amendment is as the noble lord lord bruce of donington has described an attempt to put into the bill the rpi-minus- <e>", "<cs> i am absolutely certain that the noble lord lord kaldor knows quite well what competition means and i do not propose to be drawn into a lesson on economics with him when he knows far more about economics than i do <e> <s> he knows and so do his noble friends opposite in general what will be achieved by the bill <e>", "<cs> in due course after a period of time other competitors may be licensed to take part in telephone communications throughout the country <e> <s> that is the whole purpose of the bill and i am sure the noble lord is fully aware of it <e>", "<cs> this is a matter of a fundamental difference in approach as regards economics in general between the government and the noble lord opposite so i do not really think we are going to get very far on the particular amendment which is before us now <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asked me whether i could tell him what competition is <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him whether he has read the bill because the parts with which he is concerned are perfectly adequately covered later in the bill and no doubt we shall reach them in due course <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord is now embarking upon a subject which is so general that it ought to have been part of a second reading speech but it is certainly wide of the amendment on the marshalled list <e> <s> competition will be provided by mercury by cellular radio and by local cable systems <e> <s> they will be interconnected and will not go through a central exchange <e> <s> we shall be dealing with a separate amendment relating to that specific subject in due course <e> <s> i should like to concentrate on the amendment tabled by noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> we are dealing with a specific amendment and not the general effect of the bill which is what the noble lord seems to be dealing with <e> <s> the noble lord lord kaldor is prolonging this discussion unnecessarily i think when we are shortly to change to another topic <e> <s> i hope that what i have said has at least helped to explain how the rpi-minus- <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be the first person to recognise that there are many hard-working devoted spouses of general practitioners and that they do to some extent suffer but as i have already said the professions representatives will be raising the matter in the near future with the department <e> <s> it is fair to say that successive governments have taken the view that it is not possible to reimburse wives or relatives in exactly the same way as it is possible to reimburse non-relatives for the simple reason that the risk of abuse is i am afraid to say unacceptably high <e> <s> for that reason it is best to leave it to the discussions which are to take place in march <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all those views will be taken into account in the consideration which is to take place in march and if it can be arranged through the usual channels i am sure that the matter can then be discussed in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords those points will certainly be borne in mind when the discussions occur in march <e>", "<cs> my lords that poses a rather different question and i do not think that i am going to be drawn this afternoon on the question of the salaries of members of parliament or the remuneration of the wives of members of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer the noble lord lord leatherland first of all by saying yes they are exactly the same substance <e> <s> if i can explain a little bit further the kernels of these various fruits contain substances which when extracted are dangerous <e> <s> if you were to eat the equivalent of about apricot stones i believe you would probably be taking a fatal dose or it might well be a fatal dose especially if eaten in conjunction with certain other foods <e> <s> it is as bad as that <e> <s> that is why it is necessary to make this order <e> <s> people are extracting the substance putting it into pill form and selling it over the counter <e>", "<cs> my lords the report to which the noble lord has referred made a number of recommendations on factors which influence general practitioner prescribing <e> <s> we are considering these in the context of our planned campaign <e> <s> it suggests however that there are savings to be made through generic prescribing <e> <s> this is a view which we share <e> <s> so far as the presentational characteristics are concerned the colouring the shape and the size of drugs the greenfield report noted that some patients might have reservations about differences in size shape and colour but there is no evidence that such differences are a major problem <e> <s> i am sure that the manufacturers of generic drugs will respond to demand should it become a major problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have said that they will encourage generic prescribing but that there are problems associated with generic substitution <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly true that not only the effect of generic prescribing but also the quantity of drugs which are prescribed account for a very great deal of the cost <e> <s> i have seen evidence about information stored on computers which can be recalled to show when a patient was last prescribed a drug and when he comes for a repeat prescription whether or not it is right that he should have it <e> <s> that is looked at on its merits by the doctor at the time but certainly the department will take note of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point which will certainly be borne in mind by the manufacturers <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have decided not to adopt generic substitution <e> <s> the greenfield report recommended that pharmacists should wherever possible substitute near equivalents <e> <s> this is already widely practised in hospitals but in general practice it was felt by many retail pharmacists and doctors that it was impracticable for a number of reasons not least of which were the problems of quality control and divided responsibility for the treatment of patients <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the information which the noble lord requests is not available centrally <e> <s> there may be some local difficulties but no serious problems in newly-qualified nurses finding jobs have been brought to our attention <e>", "<cs> my lords nurses have never been guaranteed posts on the completion of their training and there has always been the need for a certain amount of mobility among newly-qualified staff <e> <s> it is the case at the moment that more nurses have to move from the localities in which they train to obtain posts <e> <s> i ought to tell the noble lord also that a good proportion of recorded unemployment in nursing occurs among people whose availability for employment is somewhat restricted <e> <s> they include for example those seeking to return to the nursing service after a break in their careers <e> <s> as nursing is basically a female occupation family ties also produce problems of which the noble lord will be aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot speak specifically about westminster hospital but i will certainly bear in mind the point that the noble lord makes <e> <s> i revert however to what i said in answer to his noble friend lord molloy that some measure of mobility will be necessary in many cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unable to give a figure because the information to which the noble lord referred was supplied by the department of employment but following the introduction of the voluntary registration procedure in october of which the noble lord will be aware information about occupation is not available in the unemployment benefit office records on which the unemployment count is now based <e>", "<cs> my lords i said when i answered the noble lord lord molloy that there would he a period of time perhaps when a few people after they had finished their period of training would be unemployed <e> <s> the number of qualified nursing and midwifery staff registered as unemployed in england in september which is the last date for which figures are available was <e> <s> that was an increase of over the previous year <e> <s> the number registered as unemployed then represented about per cent <e> <s> of qualified staff and those in training and we have no reason to believe that that figure of per cent <e> <s> is any different now <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i covered that point too in answer to an earlier supplementary question <e> <s> the fact remains that the important task in the health service at the moment is to make the best use of the manpower facilities which are available generally and to make sure that they are more efficiently employed then would be the case if one just hired people to take on responsibilities which could be filled by people already in post <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure to whom the noble lord is married <e> <s> on the other hand i am quite sure that he is right <e>", "<cs> my lords essentially that is a matter for the local health authority concerned <e> <s> i am sure the chairman of the local health authority will note my noble friends remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords facilities do exist for representatives of cohse to talk to the regions concerned and of course the regions are in direct contact with the department <e>", "<cs> the noble lords who have proposed and supported this amendment have put forward a convincing case as to why the interests of consumers must be safeguarded <e> <s> i quite agree that they should be safeguarded <e> <s> but i suggest to the committee that they already are and i should like to explain how <e>", "<cs> after listening to the supporters of this amendment i perhaps ought to start by saying that this amendment or at least remarks made by members of the committee impinges to some extent on amendments which are to follow <e> <s> i am thinking particularly of amendment no <e> <s> that might provide a more appropriate opportunity to talk about the role of the radio regulatory department than this amendment does <e> <s> i hope that when i have spoken to this amendment other noble lords will feel that also <e> <s> i should also like to say to my noble friend lord torphichen that the radio regulatory department has now been transferred from the home office to the department of trade and industry <e>", "<cs> as i understand it that is not the whole purpose of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we shall be taking this matter quite a lot further on amendment no <e> <s> and i think things will be revealed to him then <e>", "<cs> may i say at the outset that the government are fully aware of the concern expressed about the continued provision of public call boxes <e> <s> we too are determined that call boxes shall continue and clause as drafted and as my noble friend lady macleod of borve says together with the draft bt licence contains very clear provisions to achieve this <e>", "<cs> the noble lord must understand that the figure could not necessarily be laid down <e> <s> the point is that it is for the director to decide what the figure should be <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly intervene and say that the figure of which is the figure at the moment which dictates whether or not a telephone is to be or could be removed subject to pouncs views on it is not in any sense meant to be a break-even figure <e> <s> that is a totally different thing <e> <s> a break-even figure and a minimum figure under which a telephone box might be withdrawn are not the same <e>", "<cs> what i hope i said to the noble lord was that the figure would be decided by the director and that it was up to him to decide <e> <s> the figure could not be put in the bill because apart from anything else the director might want to change it and if the figure were in the bill the bill would then have to be changed <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i misunderstood the noble lord but i thought that that was the point he was making <e>", "<cs> so far they have made little contribution but it is a fact that they can subsidise and clause expands on that <e>", "<cs> i fully accept that the telecommunications industry needs to attract and retain able and dedicated employees <e> <s> i would certainly join with the noble countess lady mar in paying tribute to those hard-working members of british telecom as it is at the moment <e> <s> but i also understand the very real fears that many people have about potential job losses <e> <s> i certainly have very grave doubts about whether this amendment would assist in achieving the noble lords objective <e> <s> is it right that the secretary of state or the director should be under a duty <e>", "<cs> the government certainly appreciate the need for the radio frequency spectrum to he so managed that efficient usage of the spectrum is promoted <e> <s> we also recognise that in allocating frequencies between different types of radio service and between different users there is a need to avoid appearing to favour one above another for no good reason <e>", "<cs> the noble lord explained at some length the purpose that lay behind his series of amendments when he spoke to an earlier amendment <e> <s> does the noble lord wish to intervene <e>", "<cs> not at greater length than has been the case with other amendments no but it is a question of comparison <e> <s> what i want to put across without wishing in any way to pre-empt the amendments which are going to come in later on is that this amendment rather than the earlier ones to which he spoke is probably in a way setting the tone for the others <e>", "<cs> certainly there must be clear and adequate safeguards to protect the environment in the context of telecommunications development but we believe that those safeguards are best provided by means of licence conditions constructed under the general powers of clause rather than by limitations in the code itself <e> <s> the code is designed to replace the telegraph acts <e> <s> we do not think that the case has been made for a change of approach of the kind which the amendment proposes <e>", "<cs> i think that this point is already met <e> <s> i should like to study what the noble lord has <e>", "<cs> we have certainly heard a powerful defence of the rights of property owners from the noble lord who moved this amendment and those who supported him but no government could be more concerned than this one to defend these rights <e> <s> but before your lordships leap to the conclusion that the telecommunications code overlooks or ignores the rights of landowners i ought to explain the background to our proposals <e> <s> the code is intended to replace and update the telegraph acts <e> <s> i think that it is generally agreed that these are archaic and highly unsatisfactory as the statutory framework for modern telecommunications development dating as they do hack to <e> <s> in updating them the government had to decide what general principles should govern the installation of telecommunication apparatus at a time when telecommunication services are of increasing importance to all aspects of life <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot answer that particular point at the moment <e> <s> i shall certainly find out and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> the government have made it clear that the conditions in the bt licence represent a minimum standard to which other licences applying powers under the telecommunications code will conform <e> <s> there has to be full public consultation before other licences are granted and it will be possible to deal with matters of the kind covered by this amendment in that context <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can reassure the noble lord that there is no danger of the powers of the telecommunications code being used in a way which would damage the interests of statutory undertakers such as water authorities by interfering with their activities on their operational land <e>", "<cs> paragraph <e>", "<cs> paragraph of the code enables a potential subscriber to give notice to an operator requiring him to take certain steps to afford the potential subscriber access to his system <e> <s> the paragraph also enables the operator to apply to the court to have such a notice set aside on certain specified grounds <e> <s> this amendment tries to add to those specified grounds that the works necessary to afford the potential subscriber access to the operators system would cause undue damage to the physical environment <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> which the noble lord lord mcintosh has proposed is related to amendment no <e> <s> b in the name of the noble lord lord howard <e> <s> both are concerned with the same point namely the disapplication of paragraph of the code in circumstances where it is thought that special environmental factors have to be taken into account in the context of the installation of telecommunications apparatus <e> <s> with the committees permission i should like to relate my remarks to both of those amendments <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord howard is happy with that but they are substantially the same points <e>", "<cs> i see that he is <e> <s> in connection with an earlier amendment i have explained why the government believe that the principle of occupier-only consent is necessary in order to enable telecommunications operators to provide services without delay when they are requested to do so <e> <s> it is not possible to look at paragraph of the telecommunications code which both amendments seek to amend without looking at paragraph which establishes that principle <e>", "<cs> when i spoke to lord mcintoshs amendment i gave a special commitment to consider <e>", "<cs> this amendment raises an important issue in relation to the responsibility of local authorities for ensuring in particular that the highways for which they are responsible are free from obstruction and abandoned apparatus that may be undesirable in environmental terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord feels that it has been a generous gesture <e> <s> it was certainly on purpose that it was done in this way <e> <s> so far as figures are concerned as the noble lord will appreciate it is a little early yet but at the end of the year there will be a return and that will tell us how much statutory sick pay had been paid out in the financial year <e> <s> perhaps when i have those details i can let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can give the noble baroness information on the sspe but i shall certainly find out and let her know <e> <s> will the noble baroness repeat the second part of her supplementary question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords in due course but of course the figures are not fully available yet <e> <s> when they are i shall let the noble baroness know <e>", "<cs> my lords national insurance widows have always been able to claim and qualify for sickness benefit under the normal rules but as my noble friend says the amount of benefit payable is limited under the overlapping benefit provisions to the greater of the sickness benefit and the widows benefit <e> <s> it is not really a question of having gained entitlement but it is certainly a question of having gained more money <e>", "<cs> having listened to my noble friends explanation of the intention of his amendment i can certainly say that the government sympathise with the intentions behind it and agree that there is a need for some security of tenure when wireless telegraphy licences are issued to holders of public telecommunication licences such as mercury the cellular radio consortia and of course british telecom <e> <s> the government would like to table an amendment on report which i fear will be rather longer than the amendment of my noble friend but which i think will more certainly achieve his desired aims <e> <s> i hope that with that undertaking he will see fit to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i am afraid that the amendment is not acceptable in the way that the noble lord describes <e> <s> the aim of the amendment is to ensure that parliament is informed about research and development of telecommunications apparatus especially constructed for the disabled <e> <s> i agree that this is a legitimate aim but i think that it is already achieved by amendments to clauses and which the noble lord was told about just now <e> <s> in particular <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> aa obliges the director to include in his report a general view of development in telecommunications in respect of the directors <e>", "<cs> i have certainly listened to what the noble lord has said in support of his amendment but i think that his proposals may be based on a <e>", "<cs> i think i can be equally brief <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> in amplification of what the noble lord said i presume that by this amendment he intends to ensure that any expenditure by a local authority under clause does not count towards its expenditure target and therefore could not cause grant penalties <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> refers to the general rate act but i think that this must be a mistake as expenditure targets are set under the local government finance act <e>", "<cs> i am sure that if it was possible to cut out a clause from this bill under any circumstances the government would be only too pleased to do so <e> <s> but the fact remains that the description of the reason for retaining clause which i gave to the noble lord opposite just now applies and the government think it is only right that if a local authority should want to contribute towards the maintenance of a telephone box in any particular area it should be able to do so <e> <s> therefore i am afraid that i cannot agree with what my noble friend says <e>", "<cs> sub-paragraph of paragraph of schedule is a transitional provision <e> <s> it is intended to provide that when a road is diverted or closed under the drainage northern ireland order before the appointed day the savings for the rights of british telecom under the existing legislation will remain in effect after the appointed day <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to bind the successor companys pensions policy towards recruits taken on after privatisation <e> <s> bts pension policy is not controlled in this way at present and to attempt to bind the successor companys future pensions policy could be wholly inappropriate to its private sector status <e> <s> the amendment is in any case defective in many respects since paragraph of schedule deals with pension obligations which exist at the time of transfer and cannot include future pension rights of new recruits after transfer <e>", "<cs> without going into the detail of the amendment which my noble friend proposes i can confirm that officials from the department of trade and industry have been in touch with the department of the environment about the arrangements for putting into effect the assurances given to the chief executives of the regional water authorities in the circular letter <e> <s> the department of trade and industry have just written to the water authorities to begin the process of negotiating the licences that will need to be in place when the bill becomes law <e> <s> i hope that that reassures my noble friend and that he will be able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether my noble friend is aware of the contents of the letter but under section of schedule to the water act the water authorities were given power to install telegraphic systems for their own internal use <e> <s> schedule to the bill proposes the repeal of this power and the amendment he has proposed seeks to delete that repeal <e> <s> a circular letter from the department of the environment on th january informed chief executives of the regional water authorities of the governments decision to seek to repeal this power and the reasons for that decision <e> <s> the main reason was that given the rationalisation being effected by the telecommunications bill it made little real sense having one-off provisions standing outside it <e> <s> the circular letter however explained that it was the governments intention that the water authorities should be enabled to continue to install and run telecommunications systems which they have had power to install under the water act <e> <s> this will be done by authorising the water authorities to operate the telecommunications code <e> <s> i should like to confirm that this is the governments intention <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly agree with my noble friend that all the evidence clearly shows that the nhs is not ailing <e> <s> to some extent waiting lists represent the problems of success <e> <s> the wider range of treatments available greater life expectancy and the increasing proportion of old people have all added to peoples expectations and thus their demands on the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords in many ways the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> but recently there have come to the fore other operations i am thinking in particular of hip replacements and other such operations which take rather longer than the time that the noble lord mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we want shorter waiting lists <e> <s> that is why the government have concentrated the attention of health authorities on the need to make the best use of all of their resources and we see this as one of the major tasks of the new management initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely share the noble baronesss views <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give without notice the figures for which the noble lord asks <e> <s> so far as local authorities and personal social services are concerned local authorities certainly have difficult decisions to make but there is every indication that they have sought to protect the most vulnerable people including the disabled and the elderly in the community <e> <s> taking this years budgeted expenditure into account personal social services expenditure overall will have risen by per cent <e> <s> in real terms over the past five years <e>", "<cs> my lords what i can tell the noble lord is that nearly half a million more people were visited at home by health visitors or district nurses <e> <s> as for the other information that the noble lord seeks i shall have to provide it for him in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i do not share the noble lords views <e> <s> spending on the national health service is at a record level <e> <s> since we came to office we have doubled spending on the health service from billion to some billion <e>", "<cs> my lords leeds western health authority are responsible for the pattern and delivery of health services within their boundaries <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services announced the distribution of resources to regional health authorities in early january and particular emphasis was laid on the need to develop services for joint replacement <e> <s> leeds western health authority have set up a series of meetings to consider action to reduce the orthopaedic waiting list <e> <s> i understand that it is hoped this year to adapt a ward at chapel allerton hospital which can be earmarked as the initial base there for the orthopaedic specialty <e>", "<cs> my lords representatives of the leeds western health district management team <e>", "<cs> my lords this is essentially a local matter and not one in which i could intervene at this moment <e> <s> the fact is that if chapel allerton is to be opened in the way that i suggested it might be then of course funding will be dependent upon the release of revenue from elsewhere <e> <s> but i do not think that it would be right for me to talk any further about the margarita hepton hospital to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of my noble friends interest in chiropractic and i share many of his views but i am not sure that a waiting list like the one referred to in the question would be cut if it were possible to recognise chiropractic <e> <s> first it is by no means clear that the people awaiting in-patient admission in leeds need or are seeking the type of help which chiropractors offer because one of the many problems that they are there for involve hip replacements <e> <s> secondly there are relatively few chiropractors in the country and there is no certainty that they would wish to work in the way in which the noble lord hopes that they might <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is nearly as bad as the noble lord makes out <e> <s> during the period of the last labour government the total number of nhs patients waiting for in-patient admission rose from in june to a peak of in march <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i certainly do not have figures with me that go back to but i can tell <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord said if he said then i misheard him and i apologise <e> <s> however the fact is that the total number of nhs patients awaiting in-patient admission is lower at at st march than it was in march <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the whole subject of chiropractic and professions of that sort is rather a different matter <e> <s> if my noble friend would like to put down an unstarred question on the subject i should certainly do my best to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with those who have spoken earlier in thanking the noble lord lord banks for asking this question this evening <e> <s> i know only too well that over the years the noble lord has taken more than a keen interest in a great range of social security matters not least that of the interests of the blind <e>", "<cs> my lords of course <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady jeger and to the noble lords lord banks and lord kilmarnock for their comments on this package and also to the noble baroness lady fisher <e> <s> they have raised a number of points and i shall try to deal with as many as i can <e> <s> the noble baroness lady jeger spoke about the whole business of housing not being looked at in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble baroness might have to wait rather longer <e> <s> as i said my right honourable friend will be making a statement <e> <s> however i am sure that the views which the noble baroness has expressed on this very wide and complex area will be taken into account by my right honourable friend before he makes his statement <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i shall certainly do that and will write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the government welcome the paper to which the noble lady has referred as a contribution towards the discussion about diet and health <e> <s> the james advice regarding the direction in which people should change their diet is very similar to the departments advice given in a pamphlet called <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly share with the noble lord the feeling that if we paid attention to every single comment that is made on health we probably would all end up in the way he described <e> <s> as far as fibre is concerned the government entirely share his view <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the james report was an <e>", "<cs> my lords on a day like this how could i possibly say otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord is entirely right and i know of his particular interest in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord looks very well to me but if he has any complaints i am sure that somebody will be able to look after him <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i daresay that the noble lady is right but i would still ask her to await the definitive result of the report to which i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords regulations enable bus operators to enforce a ban on smoking in any part of a public service vehicle <e> <s> but it is a matter for the bus operators taking full account of public opinion to decide whether they will implement such a ban <e> <s> the government welcome the trend towards further restrictions on smoking in buses <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding yesterdays day for no-smoking i certainly congratulate the organisers but it is too early of course to say whether it has been a success <e> <s> so far as members of your lordships house who smoke are concerned i certainly would not like to be the person who turns for example to my noble friend the deputy chief whip and says that he has just smoked his last cigar <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the government will do their best to discourage people from smoking for the reasons which i think i have made quite clear and which were also made clear when a similar question was asked two or three weeks ago <e> <s> so far as bus passengers are concerned surveys seem to suggest that comparatively few people consider smoking on buses to be a serious problem or a serious deterrent to travelling by bus <e> <s> i dare say that if long-distance bus operators were to ban smoking on their buses then they probably would not get all the customers they want <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know that question would be better directed to my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer and i certainly do not propose to be drawn into answering it now <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that the noble lord lord mishcon had been involved in that committee but i take the point that he makes <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course the government are keen on freedom of choice <e> <s> however it is a matter for the bus companies to decide for themselves whether it is appropriate to ban or discourage smoking in any particular part of a bus because there are those among the public who do not like smoking as much as others <e>", "<cs> my lords i would hesitate before getting into the middle of a discussion between the noble lord lord shinwell and his noble friend lord mishcon but i can tell him that this is not in our manifesto either <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is successful as my noble friend suggests it is then i have no doubt that other bus companies will follow <e> <s> there are other examples which i could give but i do not think it would be appropriate necessarily to compare those bus companies outside london with those bus companies within it <e> <s> the message is much the same <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it on the underground one has the choice of going into a smoking or a non-smoking compartment <e>", "<cs> my lords he can do that only if he owns a public bus and uses it for public transport <e>", "<cs> my lords of course individuals are entitled to do what they please but the fact is that as i said in answer to a question a couple of weeks ago a great deal of money and a great many working days are lost as a result of smoking and i do not think one can escape those facts <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to tell the noble baroness that this is a peripheral matter for general practitioners it is more for the cardiac departments who have a prime interest in it <e> <s> it is they who fit the devices in the first place <e> <s> re-use is also a matter for them <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly true that more sophisticated pacemakers using the techniques which the noble lord has described are becoming available both here and in other countries <e> <s> there is also a great deal to be said for fitting those who need them with the relatively simple devices in greater numbers than could possibly be afforded using the more expensive techniques <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> that is the reason why i answered the question as i did <e>", "<cs> my lords that is essentially another question but i can tell the noble baroness that in the united kingdom in pacemakers were in place <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that i had just explained to the noble baroness that the access committee is being set up and is about to start its work <e> <s> we shall have to see how it goes before i can answer the question which has been raised by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i cannot really comment any more than i have already <e> <s> i made the governments position perfectly plain on second reading <e> <s> we believe that the situation as it stands is the best way in which to cope with the problem <e> <s> i shall certainly read the noble viscounts comments but beyond that i have nothing further to say <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend thinks that i made his point rather better for him than he made it himself he might like to know that the other three countries of the united kingdom have already established access committees <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble earl has a particular interest in the marie foster home at barnet because he kindly gave me forewarning that it concerned him <e> <s> so far as other homes of that sort are concerned i cannot comment but as regards this one i can say that the health authority in whose area it is is already aware of the problem and has consulted british telecom to obtain expert advice on the equipment needed to meet the noble earls concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely take the point which the noble lord lord ennals makes <e> <s> of course <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i shall certainly bear what my noble friend says closely in mind <e> <s> so far as outgoing calls are concerned i understand that in most hospitals patients are able to make them from either fixed or mobile coin-operated telephones so presumably the charges levied on the coin-operated machines are the same as those levied elsewhere on coin-operated machines <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the contribution made by the league of friends <e> <s> that of course will continue to be something for which we have high regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely sure of the question about which the noble lord is particulary asking <e>", "<cs> my lords when i answered the noble earl and indeed the noble lord lord ennals i hope i indicated that we were taking steps to try to make those arrangements for hospitals that are built in the future <e> <s> but there are difficulties in using coin operated telephones for incoming calls because people can reverse charges on those and the charges may be met in an improper way <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter for the health authorities concerned <e> <s> we do not hold the information centrally but i shall certainly make inquiries and if we can provide the information i shall <e>", "<cs> my lords i join those who have spoken before me in thanking the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for initiating this debate and for bringing to it the depth of his knowledge and experience especially as a member of the pearson commission <e> <s> the vaccine damage payments act was introduced in as a response to the pearson commissions recommendations and it is particularly apt that the noble lord lord allen as the sole member of the commission still in this house should have asked this particular question <e>", "<cs> my lords we

subsequently denied by the bma <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that i understand that a further survey is to be carried out by the bma juniors this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that they do exactly that <e>", "<cs> my lords ministers are studying the binder hamlyn report at the moment and there is nothing more that i can say about it <e>", "<cs> my lords there is of course

particular to help in projecting the supply of and demand for doctors <e> <s> we are reviewing the entire range of information collected but at present as i have said we see no need to collect additional statistics <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to give the noble lord any indication of timescale <e> <s> as for a statement that is of course a matter for my right honourable friend and the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the statistics and the split among the various groups that might be unemployed are no longer collected in the way that they were <e> <s> this of course is a matter which more directly affects my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment but nevertheless as i said the dhss is involved in it <e> <s> i am sure that my right honourable friend will note the noble lords comments but i very much doubt whether anything can be done about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>

subsection and subsection on the other hand confer a concurrent jurisdiction on both directors general in relation to monopoly situations and anticompetitive practices <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not

into pharmacists discounts showed clearly that they had been over-reimbursed and their negotiators agreed that that was so <e> <s> a technical irregularity has so far prevented us from going ahead to

that what my noble and learned friend said yesterday will apply and i will do just that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i need respond at great length to this amendment and the amendment that is consequential to it <e> <s> as my noble friend said it would enable the secretary of state to amend by order subject to the negative resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am afraid i do not know the answer to that point but in any case it is wide of this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord mcintosh feels unable to move quite as speedily with this amendment as he hoped to do with others and i am afraid that as a result i shall have to explain my point at rather greater length <e> <s> when we previously considered this amendment i indicated that the government would be willing to consider an amendment to clause of the bill to refine the existing description of the physical description in subsection <e> <s> i should like to explain in a little more detail than i did on that occasion why we think that that would be a more appropriate course than to adopt the present amendment and those for which it is intended to provide a base <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i respond briefly to the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i did not speak to no <e> <s> bn <e> <s> i could do so in a moment <e> <s> the second half of no <e> <s> bn is addressed to a concern raised by both the noble lord and the noble lord lord howard namely that bodies like the national trust having the benefit of certain types of covenants or agreements the object of the amendment is to avoid any possibility that a defence of statutory authority could be invoked by an operator relating to the inaction over agreements of this kind that might be designed to protect the environment <e> <s> i hope that is some reassurance <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should start by saying that when i first met this bill in its very early form i was a practising pilot and was probably the last person to understand how a line could possibly fly <e> <s> however perhaps i may explain that the code itself does give operators the right to fly lines that is to hang wires from a post or other fixing on one piece of land so that they pass or fly over other land without the consent of the person owning or occupying the second piece of land above which the lines pass <e>", "<cs> my lords we considered amendments at an earlier stage which referred to the concept of undue damage to the physical environment <e> <s> i made the point then that it was very difficult to provide a meaningful description of what undue physical damage constitutes <e> <s> i think that the noble lord has probably recognised the validity of the criticism which was levelled then for this amendment apparently qualifies the concept by reference to safety or reasonable welfare <e> <s> however these refinements make matters worse rather than better <e> <s> i do not have too much difficulty with the concept of safety but reasonable welfare is a matter on which views might differ considerably <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the responsibility exhibited by doctors and i am also aware of the concern which the noble lord expresses <e> <s> i know that my right honourable friend the secretary of state will note what he says but the fact is that the report requires further consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the report may be published in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no obligation on the secretary of state to publish the report anyway and he is further considering it <e> <s> that is why it has not been published <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord and the house that there is no question of treating the profession in an offhand way <e> <s> the fact remains that this report which has been produced is being considered by ministers and when that consideration has been completed it may be published <e>", "<cs> no my lords it means that the noble lord and i each put a different interpretation on what soon means <e>", "<cs> my lords it is because my right honourable friend the secretary of state commissioned the report and it is up to him to decide when to publish it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to say anything about what the report contains <e>", "<cs> my lords all that the noble lord says about drugs is of course important but it is not directly connected with the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend certainly for the first part of his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given a perfectly clear statement on what is the position <e> <s> the fact is that my right honourable friend the secretary of state said on th december that we hoped to publish the report shortly <e> <s> for various reasons it has been decided not yet to publish the report since it is being further considered so i have nothing further to add <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable friend the secretary of state will read what has taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the best thing would be for the noble lord to wait and see the outcome of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords the most arduous rotas which required junior hospital doctors to be on duty for hours a week or more have been banned <e> <s> in addition health authorities have managed to reduce the number of juniors contracted for more than hours a week from to with prospects for a further reduction <e> <s> of these only about half are on rotas which are likely to require significant amounts of work when on-call <e> <s> overall less than per cent <e> <s> of junior hospital doctors are now on rotas which would generally be considered hard-pressed <e> <s> this is a significant improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of health and social security has issued guidance setting a one in three rota which equates roughly to hours a week as the target maximum commitment for the future <e> <s> authorities will be pursuing this as part of the normal management process <e>", "<cs> my lords the average junior is contracted for almost hours a week but works about <e> <s> the remainder of the time is quite often spent at home on standby <e> <s> many junior doctors have said that the really tiring element is not the number of <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already on numerous occasions answered questions dealing with the unemployment of doctors <e> <s> the statistics which have been displayed have not been verified by the department <e>", "<cs> my lords i obviously cannot commit anybody as to whether doctors qualifying in june will find jobs but there is no evidence to suggest that there is unemployment in the way that i think lies behind the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper refers to doctors and not to the other staff the noble lord refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to give the figures which the noble baroness asks for without notice <e> <s> an increase in the posts for junior doctors would not necessarily be the answer to reducing hours either <e>", "<cs> my lords that question is not particularly relevant to the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that point will be borne in mind by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the shortages which have occurred have been as i have said for the higher-powered hearing aids <e> <s> these aids proved to be very popular demand for them was higher than expected and delays have occurred as i said <e> <s> the fact is that to some extent we were the victim of our own success in improving considerably the range of devices available under the national health service <e> <s> as soon as we became aware of the problems estimates were revised and additional funds were made available <e> <s> the report of the royal national institute for the deaf acknowledges that there was already evidence of improvement when the survey was undertaken <e> <s> indications are that supplies are now adequate to meet the current demand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the second part of his supplementary question <e> <s> so far as the first part is concerned my right honourable friend the minister for the disabled has already responded to the report referred to in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords direct referral by general practitioners does operate in some places <e> <s> it is always done under the general authority of a consultant who remains responsible for the course of diagnosis and treatment and who alone can prescribe the hearing aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i know of no such plans <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that what my noble friend says is correct as far as miss keller is concerned <e> <s> the delays have largely been removed and increased resources have been made available <e> <s> communication with hearing aid centres has been improved and most patients receive their hearing aids in only a few weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord that the number of ent consultants increased from in to in <e>", "<cs> my lords i would entirely agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear what my noble friend says <e>", "<cs> my lords now that we have almost completed our consideration of the bill your lordships will want to know as the noble lord lord kilmarnock suggested what the governments attitude is to its further progress <e> <s> when i spoke on second reading i said that the government supported the principle of the bill <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that we still stand foursquare behind that principle <e> <s> however i also made it clear that we did see certain deficiencies in the bill as it was first presented and that these would have to be put right if it were to reach the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i respond to one or two of the remarks which have been made <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble baroness lady lockwood felt that i ought to have said what i did say about a particular aspect of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may reply first to the noble earl lord attlee <e> <s> subsection b clarifies among the other points that i made when i spoke earlier exactly to whom subsection a applies <e> <s> they are those who are <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly note what the noble lord says rather than go into it any more now <e> <s> if it needs to be in any way amended at a later stage i will see whether that is possible <e> <s> but at the moment all i can say is that i am happy that the main intention behind the amendment as proposed meets the concern which has been expressed on all sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the general welcome given to the statement by the noble baroness lady jeger and the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> i shall try to answer some of the questions they have raised <e> <s> as to the noble baronesss question relating to the holding of a debate this as she will realise is a matter for the usual channels <e> <s> i understand the noble baronesss feelings over the involvement of <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards publishing the reports the government will announce their proposals and that would be to publish separate results <e> <s> clearly there will be a need to bring together the separate work of the reviews <e> <s> essentially it is a matter for my right honourable friend to decide but i am certain that the conclusions even if not the whole of the reportswill be published in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the usual procedure is that the questions put after the two front benches have spoken should be answered individually <e> <s> perhaps i may answer the noble lord lord stallard first <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly share the noble lords concern about the complexity of the issues which these reviews are to examine <e> <s> as to the question of evidence on the competence of those who are to carry them out the party of which the noble lord is a member started its own inquiry in september <e>", "<cs> my lords low take-up is certainly something that will be considered <e> <s> as to the other point raised by the noble baroness i think i will need to refer myself back to the statement i made <e> <s> perhaps i can let her know <e>", "<cs> my lords of course representation by trade union members is important but so also is flexibility to overcome delays that have been caused by the shortage of trade union members in some cases <e> <s> the new legislation should give sufficient flexibility to avoid these problems in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords having sat mute on the government front bench throughout most of this bills passage and been gently chided on some occasions for doing so i feel that the noble earl lord longford and those others who have taken part would expect me to say a little at this stage <e> <s> i of course share fully on behalf of the government the concern expressed generally for the well-being of disabled people <e> <s> the government understand entirely the reasons lying behind the noble earls wish to legislate in this way <e> <s> additionally i would of course be the first to acknowledge the work which he and others have done to improve as they see it the bill during its examination in your lordships house <e> <s> but i have to tell your lordships that the governments view remains the same as i expressed previously <e> <s> the government set great store by the other routes that they are exploring and developing to improve the lot of disabled people <e> <s> however worthy and sincere the motives behind the bill we do not believe that it would be right to adopt the legislative framework which the bill proposes <e> <s> i would rather urge the noble earl and those who share his views to continue to give their support and encouragement to the schemes that the government already promote so that they may bear more of the fruit which the disabled so richly deserve <e>", "<cs> my lords when the greenfield report was published the government said that we were anxious to avoid continuing uncertainty but it soon became quite clear that generic substitution could not be separated from more general steps that we were considering and have now taken to make savings on the drugs bill <e> <s> all the potential saving came out of the same pharmaceutical company profits and there is a limit to how much we can take without endangering the industry <e> <s> we had to wait until it was clear how much we could save through changes in the pprs before coming to a final decision on generic substitution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that recommendation has been considered but as the noble lord lord sainsbury will know it is very much a matter for individual drug companies <e> <s> their views too have to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a method by which those that need repeat prescriptions can pay a block rate <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot remember the actual term for it but i will certainly let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last point which the noble lord raises there were i think recommendations of greenfield all but one of which were accepted by the government <e> <s> on the one to which the noble lord attributed the figure no <e> <s> i am afraid the noble lord is not correct <e> <s> there is a strong view among doctors that it would be an infringement of their freedom to prescribe drugs of their choice <e> <s> so far as the prescription charge is concerned the noble lord will remember that per cent <e> <s> of all prescriptions are free anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords our belief is that it is better to educate rather than coerce doctors in this particular way and that is why we propose to encourage generic prescribing and not substitution <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures for prescription charges are what the noble lord describes but there is no change in the categories of people who are entitled to free prescriptions <e> <s> along with the p increase in the prescription charge the income level at which people may be exempted from prescription charges will be raised by the same amount <e> <s> this ensures that no one currently on low income exemption which refers to the point that the noble lord lord ennals made will lose out due to the increase in prescription charges <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of what the noble lord says <e> <s> so far as the second part of his question is concerned when we consulted we found that there was no general support for what he suggests <e> <s> the recommendation could not be implemented without the agreement of the medical profession and and this too relates to the point raised by the noble lord lord ennals they objected to the element of compulsion involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly grateful to the noble lord lord sainsbury for his contribution <e> <s> but the fact remains that some drugs have extremely complex names and i do not think that it would necessarily be right nor convenient to the patients who have these drugs to use these sometimes extremely long and complex terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly study the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter of generic substitution has been raised and so it will not be ruled out forever but whether or not there is a possibility of further savings in the way that the noble lord suggests remains to be seen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i could not give that figure without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble countess for her remarks <e> <s> i am well aware of that kind of situation i have also come across it myself <e>", "<cs> my lords the government value the important contribution made by gp hospitals to the national health service <e> <s> their place in the pattern of district services is primarily a matter for health authorities to decide in consultation with others concerned at local level <e> <s> many hospitals closure proposals are resolved locally but in every case where the community health council opposes a closure a ministerial decision is required before closure can take place <e> <s> every case referred to ministers is considered on its merits and closure is approved only if we are satisfied that on the balance of the arguments patient services would benefit either directly or by the release of resources for developments in other parts of the service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my department will have studied all the documents to which the noble lord has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord with his experience will know quite well the government certainly do take a positive view about hospitals <e> <s> the fact is that hospitals might have to be closed for a number of different reasons for example for repairs because of staffing shortages to remove a risk of infection or for reasons of reallocation of resources <e> <s> i do not think the noble lord will find that the hospitals or the to which the noble lord lord kilmarnock referred will necessarily all meet the fate that noble lords opposite seem to think they might meet <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord refers essentially to what might be temporary closures for a variety of different reasons to which i think i gave some answer in my reply to the noble lord lord ennals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the importance of the hospitals or homes to which the noble baroness refers and to the importance of gp hospitals generally <e> <s> the essential factor is that the need for gp hospitals or anything of that sort depends very much on local conditions and it should be local health authorities that make decisions about them <e>", "<cs> my lords for several years now there has been an annual net reduction in the number of hospital beds <e> <s> however changes in the practice of medicine mean that we are now treating more patients in a fewer number of beds <e>", "<cs> my lords again much will depend on local health authorities and it is really a matter for them <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said i fully endorse the remarks of the noble lord lord cledwyn about the valuable service that these hospitals undertake <e> <s> but the fact is that the government attach importance to controlling public expenditure and health authorities have a statutory duty to remain within their allocations <e> <s> that is why it is a matter for <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly send to the noble lord a copy of the consultation procedures that lead or could lead to the closure of any small hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall send a copy of what i am sending to the noble lord lord rea to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been no reversal of the policy to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords the technical facilities required to undertake screening of blood samples for sickle cell anaemia are already available in national health service hospital laboratories <e> <s> the health education council has recently published guidance for members of the health professions and others concerned with the care of children on the problems of people with sickle cell anaemia <e> <s> the organisation of screening programmes is for health authorities to decide in the light of local needs but i understand that it is increasingly the practice to screen those at risk when they come into contact with the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that sickle cell anaemia is most likely to occur among people whose families come from or originate from west africa or the caribbean and the eastern part of the mediterranean seaboard <e> <s> i am not in a position to comment on the circumstances of the tragic case of the lambeth boy to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> i understand however that there are now arrangements at kings college hospital which serves part of the lambeth area to screen the new-born for sickle cell anaemia and at st thomas hospital for the screening of children considered at risk <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the party opposite we are at least trying to work within the limits of the money that is available <e> <s> it does not grow on trees <e> <s> that is why we believe in trying to put the duty particularly onto the local health authorities so that they can decide the priorites and the needs of their own areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the conference to which the noble lord refers and will certainly note with interest the differing schemes designed to screen the new-born that are being evaluated <e> <s> again it will be a matter for local decision based on the local needs of the population <e> <s> the noble lord lord hatch raised the fact that it was coloured children who suffered from the disease <e> <s> that varies the problem in density throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the report has been studied by the department but experience of attempts in the united states at general population screening of at-risk groups has not been favourable <e> <s> i should however like to see the report if the noble baroness has a copy <e> <s> so far as genetic counselling is concerned my noble friend will be aware that there is at present no cure for sickle cell anaemia although palliative measures can reduce mortality <e> <s> counselling and advice to prospective parents who may be carriers of the disease are thus no less important than the screening of the disease itself <e>", "<cs> my lords genetic counselling can be undertaken by obstetricians haematologists and paediatricians and in the more complicated cases the advice of a clinical geneticist can be sought and a special genetic advisory service is available in each region <e> <s> the government provide funds for the health education council and i have already mentioned the councils recent guidance for the health-care professions and others concerned with children <e> <s> we also give grants to the two main voluntary bodies in this field the sickle cell society and the organisation for sickle cell anaemia and research which are making a very valuable contribution to education information and counselling services <e>", "<cs> my lords there was no intention on my part that the answer should be curt or abrasive <e> <s> it may have been short but there is no evidence to suggest that unemployment exists as the noble lord has described it <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords manpower targets were introduced to ensure that effective use of manpower resources could be attained and the targets provide for a cut of one-half of per cent <e> <s> of the total work force by the st march that was staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i was talking specifically about employment within the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that a large number of the charges that are made about <e>", "<cs> my lords an inquiry would not change the fact that the unemployment to which i have just referred is caused by such things as personal circumstances and for example preferences for work in various locations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give my noble friend any figures <e> <s> there may be some local difficulties about newly qualified nurses but certainly no serious problems have been brought to the attention of the department <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that it was not meant to be a highly sexist comment <e> <s> it is a fact that those who are married and who are nurses may not find it convenient to move around the country to take up work in other places <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a continuing dialogue among all those to whom the noble lord referred in his question but no inquiry is intended <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the noble lords intervention is one of many interventions that will help all sorts of factors in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords as i hoped i indicated when i moved the motion would be a realistic figure but gives us adequate headroom in view of the fact that it is an administrative burden to re-set it <e> <s> there is no question of suggesting that the rate of inflation will rise as perhaps lies behind the noble lords question <e> <s> we are simply setting that limit because reviews involving or so departments are a fairly large administrative burden to bear <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for asking this question this evening even if he did so in his characteristically strident tone so late in the night after a lengthy debate on scottish affairs <e> <s> it will at least give me the opportunity to set the record straight on the fact that there are those who say that the relationship between the government and the pharmaceutical industry is not good <e> <s> i think it is better than the noble lord believes it to be despite the changes in the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme which were announced on th december last and which as he knows will reduce the profitability of that industry <e> <s> having said that of course no industry likes to have its profitability forcibly reduced <e> <s> and so the noble lord is probably right if his question means that the relationship between my department and the industry is not quite as good as it was although that will please the noble lord lord ennals who has said our relationship was probably too cosy <e>", "<cs> exactly my lords and it was in that vein that i was replying to the noble lord who was expressing the fears of all the people he had referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords in that i am entirely on the side of the noble lord lord molloy as well <e> <s> the last thing anyone wants to see is that sort of threat repeated but at the moment we have a satisfactory system <e> <s> no doubt it is impossible for any of us to say that any system is perfect and when it can be improved it will be but the fact is that we are content at present that the system is working <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord gave me a lot of figures <e> <s> as far as i can tell those figures are founded on the figures that i gave him earlier <e> <s> i talked about average losses and those are the ones which are really important <e> <s> as far as the national association of citizens advice bureaux are concerned to whom the noble lord referred i am aware that they have comments but i would not accept the remarks that they have made <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned yes the idea was to try to put two schemes into one and that achieves both aims suggested by the noble lord <e> <s> the fact is that these changes have to be kept in perspective <e> <s> it will still help over million households <e> <s> some million of the poorest pensioners with incomes up to nearly above the state retirement pensions will not be affected and over one-quarter of those affected by the taper and minimum losses will lose less than p a week <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that many local authorities for a variety of reasons experienced difficulties and delays in reassessing their million existing cases and in taking on the million supplementary benefit cases <e> <s> transitional regulations allowed benefits to continue under the old rules while problems were resolved <e> <s> the department has set up a working group as i think the noble baroness knows with the local authority association to review all the forms and pieces of paper that are involved <e>", "<cs> no my lords i entirely reject what the noble lord suggests <e> <s> as he knows full well it is part of our overall economic strategy to reduce public expenditure <e> <s> in that we are successful and we have been extremely successful in reducing inflation <e> <s> the social security budget cannot be immune from these efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords in the space of a minute or two i cannot look up the exact figures to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> he will be well aware of the complexity of the scheme in any case <e> <s> what i initially said was that of those who will lose over half will lose p a week or less and well over three-quarters or less <e> <s> those figures speak for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with others of your lordships who have congratulated the noble lord lord hunter of newington for choosing this important subject for debate today and for succeeding in getting his name drawn out of the hat <e> <s> i particularly welcome the opportunity that it has given all of us to hear the thoughtful stimulating sometimes even emotional comments mostly based on direct experience of the national health service which he and others have made on the many far-reaching issues raised by the report of mr griffiths <e> <s> this is the first time apart from at the initial announcement that the report has been discussed either on the floor of your lordships house or in another place <e> <s> therefore it will enable your lordships to participate in the process of consultation <e> <s> but i have to say that the government are not yet in a position to respond to many of the detailed points which have been raised here and in other fora <e> <s> no final decisions have been reached on how precisely to carry forward all the recommendations contained in the griffiths report <e> <s> however i am pleased to have the chance to make some more general observations about the governments views on the report and i shall do my best to clarify any of the more specific points that i can <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord ennals will agree that everything in life develops and the national health service cannot be immune from that <e> <s> the fact remains that what we hope to do with griffiths is to try to improve what was started in and that is the purpose of the griffiths report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad the noble lord is pleased with that <e> <s> i ought also to make it clear that of course there is no intention to appoint the personnel director before the general manager is in post <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lords last supplementary question i would say the very fact that my right honourable friend is taking the steps that he is indicates his concern about precisely that point <e> <s> so far as payment is concerned information is not available about payments to individual doctors or specifically to those who have re-entered national health service employment <e> <s> by st october a total of doctors had been retired <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot tell my noble friend what additional costs would be incurred in each case but i shall try to find out and let her know <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time have i answered questions on the employment level of doctors <e> <s> the fact is that the levels of employment to which the noble lord refers have not been justified <e> <s> i referred earlier to further surveys that are being carried out to look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper relates to re-employment <e> <s> i do not think that it would be particularly profitable to follow the line of the noble lords argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i sincerly hope that it will <e> <s> but the fact is that the payments were made under the remuneration and conditions of service regulations which as the noble lord will know are negotiatied by the general whitley council and approved by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> the regulations governing the payments provide for the abatement or cessation of pension payments if a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i misunderstood the noble lord <e> <s> the fact is that my right honourable friend has taken the action that i have described which i think indicates that he is just as concerned as is the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it might be best if we wait for the second question before i answer that point <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the governments intention to abolish the earnings rule as soon as resources and competing priorities allow <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government will adhere to their manifesto commitments <e> <s> our commitment to the abolition of the earnings rule remains firm <e>", "<cs> my lords i really think the noble baroness and her party are in no position to criticise <e> <s> in they froze the limit at when it was due to rise to <e> <s> we raised the limit from to in november and again to in november <e> <s> at a time of high unemployment and many competing demands for additional resources we take the view that those over pension age in full-time work or with substantial part-time earnings could not be given priority over those less well placed <e> <s> nevertheless as i have said the earnings limit was increased from a week in to in <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply have to revert to what i said earlier in answer to the noble lord and repeat that our commitment to abolish it in due course remains firm <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i do not propose to get drawn in the direction the noble baroness suggests <e> <s> there have been many ways in which the government have vastly increased the benefit of pensions to individuals over the lifetime of the last parliament <e> <s> the retirement pension has increased by per cent <e> <s> compared with a movement in rpi of per cent <e> <s> and at a time of world recession and a further pensioners that is by no means a small achievement <e>", "<cs> my lords i stress to my noble friend our commitment to abolish the earnings rule in due course <e> <s> that remains firm <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that none of us on this side of the house feels in any way that we are being anything but supported by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that there are various ways in which this could be done <e> <s> i do not know how far i can go in elucidating what i have already said to the noble lord <e> <s> the fact is that if the earnings limit had increased fully in line with the movement of prices since november it would now stand at <e> <s> but the november increase of per cent <e> <s> in the limit helped to make up some of the ground which had been lost in the two years and when it was necessary to leave the limit unchanged as an economy measure <e>", "<cs> my lords the indications are that in most of those who were eligible for but not claiming supplementary benefit were receiving housing rebates or allowances <e> <s> the introduction of the housing benefits scheme should have improved the position <e> <s> the local authorities also have a formula to identify housing benefit claimants who might also have entitlement to supplementary benefit or to housing benefit supplement <e> <s> all new pensioners are in any case issued with a claim form for supplementary benefit <e> <s> pilot schemes are currently assessing the introduction of postal claiming and these will be looked at in due course <e> <s> the addition of a freefone information and advice service across the whole range of social security benefits is now also available and that is helping the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords without notice i should not like to delve too deeply into the question of over-claiming versus under-claiming as the noble baroness suggests <e> <s> but so far as the pension books are concerned and the size of the print that is certainly a matter at which i will look to see whether anything can be done <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there was a welcome improvement between and <e> <s> in an estimated pensioners were not claiming benefits to which they were entitled <e> <s> that compares with in <e> <s> so far as projecting it forward is concerned if one were to use the old formula because the two are not directly comparable the figures would show a take-up of approximately per cent <e> <s> at the end of <e>", "<cs> my lords the reasons are rather complex and there are a number of them <e> <s> it may be that some pensioners perceive no need to claim or indeed prefer not to claim especially if their entitlement is a comparatively small one or if they are living with relatives in reasonably well-off households <e> <s> research regarding pensioners receiving rent and rate rebates and allowances shows that of pensioners informed of their entitlement to supplementary benefit only in fact claimed at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take note of my noble friends remarks and will look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the government are concerned thought and care certainly go into all these aspects <e> <s> it is also true of course that the inquiry into the provision for retirement which at the moment is being chaired by my right honourable friend will look at this matter as well and it is hoped that that might produce some answers <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason that these figures are so out of date is that they come from the biennial family expenditure survey which has not yet been looked at other than in draft for the year ending <e> <s> however they will be available in due course <e> <s> with regard to equipment this is a matter at which the department is looking and in due course it may be able to help on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that is another question which essentially relates to a different subject <e> <s> however the fact remains that this government have done a great deal to preserve the benefits that pensioners receive by sorting out the problems of inflation which of course vastly contributed to the discomfort which they felt in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords to some extent the noble lord may be correct and we are trying to do what we can to encourage those who are entitled to claim to do so in the way that i described in my answer to an earlier supplementary question <e>", "<cs> most people my lords will themselves be able to reach a judgment about their glasses and tell whether they are significantly wrong <e> <s> but the bill ensures that young developing eyes which can be damaged by incorrect glasses are dealt with only by qualified persons <e> <s> the bill requires that all glasses sold by non-opticians shall accord with a written prescription following a sight test <e> <s> this ensures that all wearers of glasses will have a periodic screening for glaucoma and certain other eye and general diseases which can be detected by a sight examination <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i hate to interrupt the noble lord but he is slightly misrepresenting what has been said <e> <s> what has been said in many cases is that we are trying to achieve better value for money <e> <s> how the noble lord can say that we are not spending more money when the sda is costing another million i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord continues how does he square his vicious attack on this governments record on the national health service with the fact <e> <s> which he knows as well as i do that this government have increased spending on the national health service by about per cent <e> <s> in real terms from billion to billion since they came to office <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords challenges are so excessively wild that i must ask him to sa how they have been affected in the way that he suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord justify his charge that nurses midwives and others have been affected in the way that he suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i share my noble friends concern about people travelling home late at night in london and especially young girls but i think it is important to remember that only a relatively small proportion of nurses use health authority accommodation <e> <s> i think that what my noble friend suggests is primarily a matter for the local health authorities and i am sure they will note her views <e>", "<cs> my lords that will all form part of the consultation process <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had answered most of those questions in the first place <e> <s> the report will be published probably later this month it is for my right honourable friend to decide precisely when and the noble lord will be aware of that <e> <s> so far as students in training and temporary accommodation are concerned these are all matters that will be taken into account in the consultative process <e>", "<cs> yes my lords there is no question of anybody being suddenly turned out onto the streets <e> <s> we shall consult on what should be the health services policy on accommodation for staff <e> <s> if it is decided to reduce the existing stock the reduction will of course be achieved over a period of years <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of what the noble baroness says about yorkshire but certainly it is true that the needs differ throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords the role of the supplementary benefit scheme in supporting homeless people in board and lodging accommodation is to pay sufficient benefit to enable the claimant to meet the charge for the accommodation of his or her choice subject to a locally determined limit which ensures that payment is restricted to a reasonable level for the area concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness will be aware responsibilities in the matter are split between local authorities on the one hand and the department of health and social security on the other <e> <s> local authorities have wide powers under the housing acts to require improvements in standards of board and lodging accommodation <e> <s> the department of health and social security plans to remind supplementary benefit staff that they should inform the local authority of any establishment that they visit where there seems to them to be cause for concern <e> <s> i note the noble baronesss point about leaflets but so far as the issue of vouchers is concerned it is for the benefit claimant to find his own accommodation <e> <s> if the landlord insists on the issue of a voucher before he will accept him as a resident then a voucher will be issued whatever the standard of the accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that this particular matter will form part of my right honourable friends survey <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the picture is as black as the noble baroness points out <e> <s> this government have a record of selling council houses to those who need them which has been a highly popular move the noble baroness will be well aware of that <e> <s> local authorities are beginning to build particularly sheltered houses <e> <s> furthermore there are a great many joint schemes in conjunction with the dhss which are also beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that some landlords make excessively high charges and this is something which we must draw to the attention of the local authorities when these matters arise <e> <s> but as i said just now in answer to the noble baroness on the front bench this government have done a great deal and are continuing to develop means of improving the housing situation throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely sure what point the noble lord makes but as i said in the cases where excessive charges have been made by landlords every step that can be taken to bring it to the attention of the local authority is being taken <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not apply just to the dhss it also applies to the local authorities <e> <s> that is why in answer to an earlier supplementary i said that when the supplementary benefit officers go round and look at the accommodation they will draw to the attention of the authority standards which are not satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for her helpful supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the situation with single payments but i can say to the noble baroness that this is a question to be decided jointly between the local authorities who provide the houses and the supplementary benefit authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that what the noble lord says about the dedication of these people is perfectly correct <e> <s> i understand that the professions representatives and no doubt they could include the people to whom the noble lord particularly refers will be raising the matter shortly with officials <e> <s> i cannot say whether it will be possible to make any improvement in the current arrangements but at this stage i must say that i think it is fairly unlikely that given the resources available and the competing demands upon them that will be possible <e> <s> however i should not like the noble lord to go away with the impression that the matter is entirely closed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i fully share with the noble lords lord wallace and lord molloy their views on the precious nature of sight <e> <s> i am fortunate enough at the moment not to need glasses <e> <s> but perhaps it would help if i reminded the committee of the origin of the existing restrictions on sales of optical appliances in section of the opticians act <e>", "<cs> since a pair of glasses will not be available without the prescription in the first place the fact that the person concerned goes to a qualified person to get the prescription means that his eyes will be tested <e> <s> i hope that that will answer the point that my noble friend makes <e> <s> as to the frequency of those tests that is a matter for a regulation on which we are consulting at the moment <e>", "<cs> i should like first to deal with the question of old age pensioners <e> <s> there are no medical grounds for excluding the over-s from unregistered suppliers <e> <s> their eyes are no more capable of permanent damage from inappropriate glasses than are those of younger adults <e> <s> it is probably true as the noble lord <e> <s> lord banks suggests that a higher proportion of this age group require more powerful lenses but this does not of itself make unregistered sellers undesirable <e> <s> indeed patients with high-powered lenses are more likely to notice visual distortions <e> <s> there is no argument for excluding pensioners from the benefit of greater competition and the lower prices that this will bring <e>", "<cs> not for the first time have i or many of my noble friends stood at this dispatch box and discussed the question of affirmative versus negative resolution <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord northfield knows what i am talking about <e> <s> i cannot share my noble friends enthusiasm for the affirmative resolution procedure in this case either <e> <s> the bill as drafted provides an adequate means of parliamentary scrutiny <e> <s> the orders which can be made under it can be the subject of a prayer by either house <e> <s> the government have been open minded on this subject <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord is twisting my argument <e> <s> what i said was that these are mainstream examples of subordinate legislation not unusual orders and i think the noble lord in the way that he put it is in fact misrepresenting the argument <e>", "<cs> i have listened with care to what the noble lord lord rugby said in moving his amendment and to what my noble friend lord mottistone said also <e> <s> i have to tell lord rugby that i do not believe that this amendment actually achieves his intentions <e> <s> as i see it having carefully looked at the opticians act and the bill his amendment would merely alter the nature of the proof required when someone sought to use the defence that they sold glasses as an antique rather than to correct or whatever a defect of sight or as the amendment would make it to correct an optical abnormality or disease <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord wanted this amendment to allow a general defence against prosecution on the grounds that the glasses concerned were only intended to correct the results of the natural ageing process of the eye or presbyopia <e>", "<cs> i certainly shall come back to the noble lord <e> <s> i think that probably he is correct but i need to seek advice on that <e> <s> section is probably the appropriate place but i shall need to confirm it in writing <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with the intention which lies behind the amendment of the noble lord lord rugby <e> <s> in future many people will probably keep prescriptions for glasses upon their persons but if not it will not be too onerous to have to go to a registered optician <e> <s> one of the benefits of increased competition will be that the prices charged by opticians will become more reasonable <e> <s> also increased competition will make all suppliers more customer-conscious and give a faster service <e>", "<cs> if i can return to the noble lord the point is that if he is referring to frames there is nothing to suggest that the repair of frames is illegal <e> <s> i accept the fact that hinges come undone and that damage can be done to the plastic <e> <s> we have all seen examples of repairs which have been made to glasses <e> <s> the noble lord in praying in aid the point about damage suggested that it would not be possible for someone to get a repair to his glasses over the weekend <e> <s> i understand the intention behind the amendment but i think we should be going a little too far in this case particularly in view of the fact that frames can be repaired at the present time while broken lenses cannot be repaired anyway <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i do have some sympathy with the point of the noble lord lord winstanley and my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> when i have been asked to do anything in this line i have found a very thin piece of fuse wire to be an answer and it has worked quite well <e> <s> i cannot give an undertaking that it will be possible to do anything but i shall take away what the noble lord has said and study it in the <e>", "<cs> i note what the noble baroness said in proposing her amendment but i have to tell her that i feel that her amendments are unnecessary <e> <s> the clause already requires that where changes are made without the gocs consent the orders shall have to be approved by both houses of parliament <e> <s> in other cases either house can pray against the orders <e> <s> members of your lordships house and of another place represent the public <e> <s> to require affirmative resolution procedure unless both the goc and bodies representing the public have indicated consent might well require all orders to be so treated <e> <s> the goc and the other bodies might well take up opposed views <e> <s> it is more satisfactory for the government to perform their usual role in such matters and reach their own judgment after carefully considering all viewpoints <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that st thomas is at risk in the way the noble lord suggests under any of the options proposed in the district health authoritys consultative paper <e> <s> the options range from a very small reduction in the number of beds that is minus at st thomas to a large increase in the number of beds that is plus if south western and tooting bec hospitals were to close <e>", "<cs> my lords these matters are looked at in a broad perspective but the fact is that they are also matters which affect people who live locally and that is why it is appropriate that they should discuss them locally first before they come before ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords they are not serious in the way the noble lord suggests <e> <s> the closure of both the south western and tooting bec hospitals is only one of four options in the document to which this all relates <e> <s> the other options would involve closure of one or other of these two hospitals or moderate reductions at all three hospitals in the district <e> <s> it would not be right for me to comment in detail on the options because they are still being discussed publicly <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals mentioned in particular the mentally ill and the intention is quite rightly to improve local services for mentally ill people <e> <s> the services for them will not necessarily be made worse just by closing hospitals but will be improved by returning these people to the community <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i fully accept that and i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we all have to live within our means and it is for the west lambeth health authority to consider how best to live within its cash limit and to identify areas of waste and priorities for development <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that much of what my noble friend says is quite true <e> <s> rawp has a history and has sometimes over-provided <e> <s> it is difficult to forecast exactly how populations will shift <e> <s> nevertheless we have to base plans on something and it has been done through rawp <e>", "<cs> my lords as i thought i had earlier made clear there is no risk to st thomas in the way the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures i gave in answer to an earlier supplementary do not go quite so far as the noble lord lord annan suggests <e> <s> the four options vary between a reduction at the least of beds to an increase of <e> <s> therefore what the noble lord says i do not think is necessarily correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must say that i find the noble lords remarks so exaggerated that i do not think that they will help the issue at all <e> <s> the fact remains that this is out for consultation <e> <s> it is a matter for local concern to establish the needs and the concern and interest expressed will be based on the options i have described <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord an answer about the dermatology unit but i shall find out and let him know <e> <s> the main point is that spending on the health service is now at a record level and we intend to increase it still further but we are also committed as the noble lord is aware to achieving a greater equality of access to health care throughout the country <e> <s> it is therefore essential that londons health authorities plan for changes in the pattern of services in line with their reduced populations <e> <s> this was the point brought out by my noble friend lady gardner <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i do not think that it would serve any useful purpose for me to stand at the dispatch box and go through each of the london health districts describing what their plans are <e> <s> i would remind the noble lord opposite that there were hospital closures under the last labour government which compares with only during the present administration and a large increase in capital expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my words of congratulation to the noble lord lord henderson on so lucidly introducing this important debate on smoking and health <e> <s> sadly as we have heard and there is no doubt about it cigarette smoking is still the greatest avoidable cause of illness and death in our society <e> <s> as such there can be no more important subject in the whole field of preventive health care to bring before your lordships <e> <s> i welcome the chance that it has given us to consider an issue which is central to the nations health and well-being and to explain the governments intentions and success <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly do not share the view which has sometimes been expressed that the only way things can be improved is by massive injections of money though expenditure has doubled in cash terms and represents per cent <e> <s> more than <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that more than one conclusion can be reached from it <e> <s> waiting lists as the noble lord will know are for us still a cause of concern but the fact is that the record waiting lists which we inherited have been reduced and we want to bring them down further <e> <s> capital spending has been increased by per cent <e> <s> the party opposite cut it by per cent <e> <s> thirty-nine new hospital schemes worth more than million have been started since april <e> <s> i could go on for a long time but the fact is that the improvements in the way people can be treated are bound to result in an increase in waiting lists because there are now facilities which were not previously available <e> <s> so to some extent it is success nothing else which has caused the increases in waiting lists <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not accept what the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot without notice give an answer to the first supplementary question of my noble friend <e> <s> so far as attendances by new accident and emergency patients are concerned the figure in was and in it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for that supplementary question <e> <s> what he says about england is a great credit to the present administration <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not have the figures for scotland because of course i do not have any responsibilities for scotland in this respect it is managed by the scottish office <e> <s> however i can find out and i shall try to let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness has a point there <e> <s> this is a matter on which my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary for health made an announcement fairly recently <e> <s> i believe that this is the kind of thing we can do to help <e> <s> my honourable friend yesterday made an announcement a copy of which i can certainly let the noble baroness have <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give my noble friend figures on that but it is certainly true that some people who have appointments do not keep them and that of course is no great help <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of that but it is a matter which should be drawn to the attention of the health authorities concerned <e> <s> i think the noble baroness would agree that this is a matter for the local health authorities to deal with and i am sure they will note her remarks <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the total number of nhs patients waiting for in-patient treatment on th september was fewer than at th march <e> <s> it would have been lower still but for the industrial action in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to go as far as we possibly can and i am sure that other members of your lordships house feel the same <e> <s> i certainly hope that we shall get to the severe disablement allowance but i honestly cannot give an undertaking as to exactly how far we shall go <e> <s> it is up to all those who wish to take part in the debates on the amendments <e>", "<cs> having listened to the noble lord lord ennals i have to say that i fear there may be a basic misconception among those who have spoken to this amendment about pensioners and their glasses that the ending of general optical service glasses will be a financial disadvantage to them <e> <s> it is certainly true that many pensioners prefer already to purchase private glasses or private frames <e> <s> among users of general optical service glasses the average subsidy these figures are important is around or to put it another way about p a week over two years <e>", "<cs> i cannot share or really understand the desire to monitor and control with all the bureaucracy which it implies and to which the noble lord lord monson refers <e> <s> numerous products of all sorts are sold in this country day in and day out <e> <s> the belief that glasses are a product requiring elaborate special controls has reached something of a myth over the past few months <e> <s> we are not talking about explosives or dangerous drugs <e> <s> as has been said numerous times in the passage of this bill badly dispensed glasses cannot do harm to adult eyes <e>", "<cs> i understand the point that the noble baroness is making but again that is something which will be obvious to the person who wears the glasses <e>", "<cs> if that is the case i cannot see that that will do any particular damage <e> <s> i dare say that it is something that will be considered in the orders <e> <s> but i have to tell the noble baroness that i am not quite clear in what way if a lens became swapped around for example that it could do any damage to eyes <e> <s> i should have thought and i think that this is confirmed by all the experts that it would become quite apparent to the person wearing the glasses that they were the wrong way round <e>", "<cs> i think that this was something that we covered earlier <e> <s> i do not think that there is reason to be as concerned as the noble baroness is about accidents <e> <s> this was something that we covered when we were last in committee <e> <s> i do not believe that her concerns are all that well founded <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i am not an expert on the sale of goods act <e> <s> that act and the supply of goods and services act are there <e> <s> despite any length of time that they may take the fact is that those procedures are available to people who wish to complain in the way that the noble lord suggests they might <e> <s> i do not think that such problems are quite as strong as the noble lord fears them to be <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt my noble friend but may i just answer the specific point of the noble lord lord prys-davies <e> <s> one thing of which i was not aware is that there are small claims procedures in county courts which are both cheap and quick <e> <s> i hope that that reassures him on the sale of goods act <e>", "<cs> i think the first thing i ought to say is that i share with the noble lord lord ennals and my noble friend a very real concern for those who are mentally ill or detained in any way under the mental health act <e> <s> as i think both my noble friend and the noble lord know it is one of my particular responsibilities <e> <s> but i have to tell the noble baroness lady robson that this amendment is an unnecessary one for some of the reasons which have already been expressed <e>", "<cs> i am sure it will not be frittered away and so far as i know the idea is that it should be spent in a way that she wants it to be spent but if i am wrong i shall let her know as soon as i can <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i did not hear everything that the noble lord said <e> <s> i wonder whether he could kindly repeat it <e>", "<cs> i do not think that that is necessarily true <e> <s> those who are detained under the mental health act for whatever reason will get their glasses free <e> <s> they will be in a hospital of one sort or another <e> <s> they will be looked after by people who have a great deal of experience in these matters and they will he taken care of <e> <s> as i understand it the fears of the noble lord lord kilmarnock do not stand on solid ground <e> <s> but this is an issue that i shall look into <e> <s> i do not think that he is right <e> <s> however if he is i shall let him know <e>", "<cs> i am sure that i can give the noble baroness that assurance <e> <s> it is again an issue that falls into my particular area <e> <s> i shall therefore take an especial note of what she says and do what i can to ensure that all these conditions are complied with <e> <s> however i should not like to be drawn on what the noble lord lord kilmarnock said without re-reading and studying that part in great detail <e> <s> i cannot give an answer without some notice <e>", "<cs> the amendment as we have heard is essentially similar to that advocated on behalf of the mentally ill a few minutes ago and extends to the elderly to the disabled and to those needing complicated glasses <e> <s> i think that the principle at stake is essentially the same <e> <s> in brief the argument is whether financial assistance or subsidies should be given on any other basis than that of financial need <e> <s> the government say <e> <s> no <e> <s> among the registered disabled of whatever disability there will be some who are on low incomes and others who are not <e> <s> we believe that no one should be denied access to the glasses they need on financial grounds <e> <s> the bill achieves this objective <e> <s> the amendment tackles all types of disabled person <e> <s> among those who need glasses many will require quite ordinary ones <e> <s> we believe that these may well cost less in a competitive private market than they do today under the national health service <e> <s> already some private glasses from a qualified optician cost less than the average charge for nhs glasses <e> <s> competition i think will make this the norm <e>", "<cs> i am not sure of the technical features of the types of glasses which will be in that particular category <e> <s> i think i might be right in saying that this will feature in subordinate legislation in the form of the orders which will come out in due course <e> <s> i really have to leave it to my right honourable friend to carry out the promise which he made at report stage that it will not severely disadvantage or disadvantage in any way those who need these peculiarly expensive glasses <e> <s> i hope that reassures the noble baroness <e> <s> it is something i can look at get more details on and let her know about <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is right and perhaps this will reassure the noble baroness too <e> <s> possibly it will cover those now subsidised by or more <e> <s> i say possibly advisedly because no final <e>", "<cs> i am well aware of my noble friends particular interest in drafting <e> <s> i must say that i too find the words used by draftsmen are more often than not extremely tortuous <e> <s> i shall have a look at it to see whether it can be changed <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot meet my noble friend on the matter of principle to which he referred just now because in formulating this clause the government were intent on striking a balance between two objectives <e> <s> the first objective which my noble friend and the government clearly share is to ensure that the public have an informed choice between the registered or enrolled optician and alternative retailers <e> <s> we believe this is achieved by the continuation of the registers and lists maintained by the goc and by preventing anyone from implying that they are on those registers or lists when they are not <e> <s> our other objective is to allow people who sell glasses to use the historically accepted word for that occupation which is the term optician <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i misrepresented my noble friend i had no intention of doing so <e> <s> what i meant was what my noble friend has just said <e>", "<cs> take it from what the noble lord lord ennals said earlier that he proposes to deal entirely separately with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> so if that is the case what i propose to do is to give my answer to amendments nos <e> <s> and and come back to amendment no <e> <s> after he has spoken to it and in doing so i shall comment on each of those amendments <e>", "<cs> the national recall system was not so effective as the noble baroness and the noble lord lord ennals have made it out to he <e> <s> that is why it was stopped and that is why we are setting up new arrangements <e> <s> new ages for women to be screened are also proposed <e> <s> the noble baroness may be aware of them <e> <s> the recall scheme as the noble baroness knows is no longer centrally organised <e> <s> responsibility for it has passed to the local district health authorities most of which have schemes running or in an advanced state of planning <e> <s> the reason for this as i have said is that the national scheme was not so effective as it should have been <e> <s> while many use fpcs on an agency basis and will no doubt continue to do so it is for the dha to determine the most appropriate local recall arrangements <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent a health authority from developing its own recall system if it is felt to be a local priority and the resources for it are available <e>", "<cs> i cannot give the noble lord the figures for which he asks now but perhaps i may find them out and then let him know them <e> <s> before i sit down perhaps i may refer to a point raised by the noble baroness lady robson concerning cervical screening because it is important that i should clarify what i said <e>", "<cs> i recognise the important role which general practitioners have in regard to the screening of women in the way which the noble lord describes <e> <s> however as i said earlier the district health authorities have in many cases quite advanced recall schemes going ahead and they also have responsibility for the laboratory service <e> <s> i am more than satisfied i have seen some of these schemes being prepared or in action that they work perfectly well so i do not share the noble lords view that screening should be passed to the fpcs <e>", "<cs> i am <e>", "<cs> i hate to disappoint the noble lord but i am not going to make a concession <e> <s> the important thing is that the deputising services as they have been arranged and as they have been examined by my right honourable friend the minister for health are given a chance to work <e> <s> i cannot suggest that it would be right for me to accept amendment no <e> <s> in any way <e> <s> my right honourable friend has made strenuous efforts to make sure that the deputising services do improve and they must be given the chance to work <e>", "<cs> the good news that i am going to give the noble lord is that the changes proposed by the bill will take the accountability for looking after deputising services rather further <e> <s> ministers will have responsibility for monitoring the standards of deputising services <e> <s> the inclusion of lay members in the committees responsible has been widely welcomed by those who commented on the original proposals <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness herself described the effect of this amendment but i have to tell her that such an extension is unnecessary

which we already have in hand <e> <s> we shall consult very widely when looking for names for new members but of course in order to preserve continuity and expertise there is likely to be a substantial number of reappointments of those who are serving at present and are willing to continue to do so <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness will be aware it is the object of this provision to simplify and strengthen the administrative arrangements for the provision of family practitioner services <e> <s> the noble baroness has set out her views quite clearly and i hope that the committee will bear with me if i set out mine equally clear but i fear at slightly greater length <e> <s> the present arrangments were made in with the best of intentions <e> <s> it was hoped that the administrative links with dhas would create opportunities for bringing hospital family practitioner and other community services together within an integrated health service <e> <s> however it has become increasingly apparent that the administrative dependence of fpc <e>", "<cs> i ought to respond to some of the points that have been raised from the benches <e>", "<cs> if i misrepresented the noble lord i apologise for doing so but the fact is that he did not take many of the steps which we have now taken <e> <s> competitive tendering is one <e> <s> the griffiths inquiry is another <e> <s> there has also been the korner inquiry and the rayner scrutiny of the national health service <e> <s> these all point to greater efficiency <e> <s> none of us can sit back and say that the system is perfect and does not require improvement because the noble lord knows as well as i do that the nhs is a bottomless pit into which one could pour almost the entire gnp and still people would not be satisfied with it <e> <s> this is why it is essential that all aspects of the national health service should receive very careful scrutiny to achieve the best possible value for money <e>", "<cs> no it will not be at greater cost <e> <s> the whole point is that we are trying to achieve greater efficiency and greater value for the money that is spent <e> <s> that applies to the family practitioner committees as well as to the other arrangements <e>", "<cs> is the noble baroness referring to griffiths <e>", "<cs> griffiths is not going to be expensive <e> <s> we ought not to debate griffiths now because it is an entirely different subject <e> <s> the important point is that accountability and responsibility for managing the national health service has not featured so prominently in the past as it ought to do in the future <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord <e> <s> lord prys-davies has said <e> <s> although the government endorse wholeheartedly the intentions of both parts of this amendment i have to tell the noble lord that it is in our view unnecessary <e> <s> schedule to the bill amends section to the national health service act so as to require health authorities and fpcs to co-operate with one another in order to secure and advance the health and welfare of the people of england and wales <e> <s> such co-operation would certainly involve a two-way traffic of necessary information between the two authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer the extent of the problem in terms of addiction is difficult to measure <e> <s> it is not actually addictive in the same way as drugs or cigarette smoking are it is more of a dependency <e> <s> we have no firm information on numbers but all the indications are that of all those who sniff per cent <e> <s> give it up and only per cent <e> <s> require special help <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord will be more familiar than i am with the differences between scottish law and english law but the fact is that the common law in scotland does allow the imposition of a penalty in the way that he described <e> <s> but so far as legislation is concerned the solvent abuse scotland act states that the misuse of volatile substances is grounds for a referral for compulsory care whereas in england and wales the existing legislative framework under the children and young persons act allows for a child or young person below the age of to be detained in a place of safety if his health is being avoidably impaired or neglected or if he is being mistreated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that in his consultation my right honourable friend will take note of that point <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend may have a point <e> <s> that is why i think it is important that these things are tackled gently and not in too harsh a fashion in the way suggested by those who say that immediate legislation might solve the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that but i think it sounds an excellent idea and i certainly commend it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords there are a great many substances of which we are aware which have the same effect and we shall certainly note what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the media can help in this respect but i think we have to await the results of the initiative which my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for health announced last december <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know specifically whether any direct correlation between the two has been investigated <e> <s> i am sure there is merit in looking at it and shall draw my right honourable friends attention to what has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be true <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the information is that deaths totalled in as against in but the increase should not necessarily be interpreted as an increase in the practice because there are all sorts of compounding variables <e> <s> for example it may be that more deaths are reported because of a greater awareness of the practice which has been brought about through media coverage <e>", "<cs> my lords we debated snuff and smoking last week and i am sure that noble lords had an opportunity then to discuss this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the present policy lays emphasis on routine screening for cervical cancer every five years for all women over years of age and younger women who have been pregnant on three or more occasions <e> <s> the committee on gynaecological psychology which is an independent committee of experts has recommended that for younger women a smear should be taken when they are first coming forward for contraceptive advice or when otherwise requested and thereafter at ages and but at no other ages except during pregnancy <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords if there have been delays they are probably delays in the laboratory work which is needed to produce the results of the tests <e>", "<cs> my lords there is not the backlog which the noble baroness suggests that there is <e> <s> we are aware that there have been some local difficulties in certain laboratories in some parts of the country i am thinking particularly of greenwich and waltham forest but there are no general fears of a backlog in the way that is suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords there is not the evidence to suggest that there is any backlog in the provision of these tests because they are provided in the way i described in the original answer <e> <s> so far as the recall system is concerned the noble lord will be aware that the national health service centralised recall system did not work effectively <e> <s> in fact only about per cent <e> <s> of all recall forms actually achieved a response so that system was as he knows abandoned and the idea now is that health authorities should set up their own schemes <e> <s> they were asked to provide alternative arrangements in conjunction with family pactitioner committees by april <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the view of the right reverend prelate but the fact is that after this particular rate was introduced by a labour government in no labour government extended the long-term rate to the unemployed <e> <s> but since this government came into office we have reduced the qualifying period from two years to one year and we have given automatic entitlement to the long-term rate to all men aged and over <e> <s> we have also made receipt of long-term incapacity benefits a qualification for eligibility to the long-term scale rate <e> <s> it is not possible with the means available to us to do everything but those are certainly steps in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the latter figures for which the noble baroness asked <e> <s> the fact is that the government are aware of the advice of the ssac but nevertheless for the reason i gave in my original answer it is not possible to extend the benefit with the means at our disposal <e> <s> the noble baroness will be aware that the review which my right honourable friend is now conducting into the supplementary benefits scheme will include an examination of the schemes structure and that will inevitably involve looking at the provisions made for different groups of claimants <e>", "<cs> my lords various suggestions have been made for extending the long-term scale rate to different groups of unemployed claimants those with children those whom the noble lord lord kilmarnock mentioned and older people <e> <s> but they would all involve a substantial cost and i am afraid that the money is not available <e>", "<cs> my lords there will of course be cases throughout the country where some people who claim supplementary benefit are in a worse way of being than others <e> <s> but it is not possible to produce money out of a hat in the way that the party opposite so often claims that it is possible to do <e> <s> if we are talking about excessively large sums of money then they have to be found at times when the conditions are right for <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware that we have already taken steps to reduce the poverty trap and these were made quite clear in the up-rating statement last year <e> <s> the fact that we have been able to achieve so much for all sorts of people by reducing the rate of inflation which was so prevalent at the time when the party opposite was in power has done a great deal to help many people including those on supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i have not actually seen the report to which the noble baroness refers but i shall certainly look at it <e> <s> the fact is that in addition to supplementary benefit as such claimants can also get additions and single payments for all sorts of different facilities <e> <s> the noble baroness will be aware of the enormous list of benefits of that type which are available and that is also a considerable help to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have many obligations some of them are moral and some of them have to be based on economic fact <e> <s> only on monday my noble friend lord gowrie explained to your lordships at question time that while the problem of the long-term unemployed is a real one the solution to it lies in the economic policies which the government are adopting <e>", "<cs> i of course entirely accept that it is undesirable for health authorities to have to cope with changes in their spending position late on in the financial year <e> <s> therefore i have some sympathy with the spirit of the amendment of the noble baroness but i have to say to her that despite that sympathy it would in practice be an unnecessarily restrictive measure in ways in which i think that the noble baroness herself would not intend although i am well aware as the noble lord lord ennals has said of her experience in these matters <e>", "<cs> i accept of course the views expressed by several of your lordships that retrospective legislation is not looked upon favourably by this house or generally <e> <s> but clause of the bill puts beyond argument the remuneration arrangements for the four national health service contractor professions the general medical practitioners the dentists the opticians and the pharmacists <e> <s> the effect of the proposed amendment which has been tabled by the noble lord lord ennals would be to exempt from the operation of the clause any determination which would result in a retrospective adjustment of renumeration in respect of more than one year <e> <s> perhaps i should explain what that would mean <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene briefly to say that after years of agreeing with a system which had long operated in relation to the pharmacists and other professions and which i am sure the noble lord himself must have noted when he was in the position he then held the psnc suddenly claimed that the secretary of state did not have the power <e> <s> the noble lord himself held this power but apparently it is not power in statute <e> <s> we do not accept that but clearly it is desirable for the position to be clarified <e>", "<cs> first i entirely share the view of my noble friend lady hornsby-smith that in this case we are talking about taxpayers money <e> <s> of course to have to claim repayments for four years is unsatisfactory but the pharmacists knew when they agreed to the inquiry that the day of reckoning would eventually come <e> <s> unfortunately lack of co-operation with the inquiry by some pharmacists succeeded in postponing the day excessively <e>", "<cs> i must say that i find myself skating on ice sometimes which feels to be a little thin under my feet when we are dealing with legal matters upon which my noble friend lord renton is such an expert <e> <s> i hope that i said nothing in my earlier remarks which in any way could be interpreted as being improper in the light of the fact that there is an appeal pending <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can come back on one particular point about the expedition of the leave to appeal <e> <s> i have to say that the psnc s case as i said earlier was heard and rejected by the high court on th february and its application for expedition of its appeal was rejected on st may <e> <s> i do not know whether that will colour my noble friend s views <e>", "<cs> it is relevant in so far as we maintain and it has so far been upheld by the high court that what we are doing is within the law and as such has been practised for many years in the past <e>", "<cs> the employment protection consolidation act provides for continuity of employment between associated employers but continuity is broken when an employee moves to the employment of another employer who is not associated <e> <s> it has been established in employment case law that health authorities are not associated employers <e>", "<cs> the answer to that is employees in all sorts of other parts of the public service such as education and water <e> <s> i could go on for some time <e>", "<cs> i think i would need notice of that question but i am under the impression that it does not <e> <s> that is the reason for what is involved here <e> <s> if i am incorrect i should let the noble lord know but i do not think the act extends in the way he suggests <e>", "<cs> before i deal specifically with the amendments i too feel as the noble lord lord ennals did that i ought to make one or two general observations about sda which are relevant to the consideration of any of the other amendments to follow which we shall discuss in due course <e> <s> first i think that it is important to remember that these new benefit proposals will initially bring an extra disabled people to benefit for the first time <e> <s> i know that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for the way he has received the comments that have answered i hope some of the points that have been raised <e> <s> of course i understand that this is a complicated area and that it might be possible to reassure people by a detailed explanation which is not always possible across the floor of the committee i understand that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene briefly to reassure the noble lord <e> <s> there is absolutely no intention that the public discussion should be in any way curtailed <e> <s> it is merely a question of trying to clarify certain points which would otherwise form the basis of an amendment which was not necessary at a later stage in the bill <e> <s> i think that the suggestion of the noble lord lord ennals is a very good one and it is one that i should like to adopt <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment is in many ways similar to that of the group which we discussed just now namely amendments nos <e> <s> to in that it would extend the easier under- qualifying rule to two specific categories of claimant who might first become incapable of work after the age of without having had the opportunity to build up an adequate contribution record <e> <s> i do not think that i need repeat all the points that i have already made but will simply re-emphasise the fact that we do not consider it right to single out particular groups for such concessions in this way <e>", "<cs> i fully accept that at the end of the day when we have discussed these matters in a less formal forum we may not necessarily be able to agree in which case it is fairly obvious that we shall have to consider discussions in your lordships house <e> <s> but it is important that the areas of misunderstanding are cleared up <e> <s> in any case some of the points which the noble lord lord henderson raised have been covered by the answer i gave <e>", "<cs> the additional disablement test for those who first become incapable of work after the age of is intended to concentrate the available resources on the most severely disabled <e> <s> in assessing disablement we propose to use the same criteria as currently apply with success in the industrial injuries and war pensions fields <e> <s> i shall elaborate on that in a moment <e>", "<cs> the issues at the heart of these amendments have received considerable attention during the course of the debate today and i do not propose to go over all that ground in detail again <e> <s> we have never made any secret of the fact and this seems to be something shared by the noble lord lord ennals and i am sure that the noble lord lord stallard <e> <s> heard him earlier that abolishing the household duties test and permitting married women to receive ncip simply on the basis of incapacity for work was not a viable option <e> <s> it was not a viable option because it would bring in about additional beneficiaries over and above those already drawing ncip and hncip and it would increase expenditure by million a year at current benefit rates <e> <s> we have continually made clear that money on this scale is not available and even if jit was i am far from convinced that spending it in this way would be the best use of scarce resources <e> <s> there are many competing pressures for improvements in the field of benefits for disabled people and the extension of ncip to married women is only one <e> <s> perhaps i can give the noble lord a few examples million in all would pay for the introduction of a blindness allowance at million the extension of invalid care allowance to married women at million and a partial incapacity benefit along the lines of that suggested by the social security advisory committee <e> <s> it would go a considerable way towards paying for the removal of upper age limits for mobility allowance <e> <s> for those who <e>", "<cs> the short-term child dependency addition is paid mainly with unemployment and sickness benefits and it has been steadily reducing over the past few years as child benefit has been going up <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that there would be any merit in having a lengthy debate at this time of night on the relative attendance of either side of the committee <e> <s> nor do i need to speak at considerable length about this particular issue <e> <s> as the noble baroness knows this matter was raised yesterday <e> <s> i then explained that although the government are well aware of the arguments and they have been explained admirably tonight for extending the long-term scale rate to unemployed claimants after they have been receiving supplementary benefit at the ordinary rate for a year which is the usual proposal this would cost million and that on cost grounds alone it would have to be ruled out <e>", "<cs> no one is suggesting that anybody is a second-rate citizen <e> <s> the noble lord is stepping very wide of the amendment <e> <s> he is starting a debate on a totally different and much wider matter of economic policy and on questions concerning foreign affairs which have nothing to do with our debate on this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not have the figures for that group but this is something we shall look at and we shall do some calculations <e>", "<cs> my lords the proportion of supplementary pensioners with heating additions has gone up from about per cent <e> <s> in to about per cent <e> <s> in and the proportion of unemployed people with heating additions has gone up from about <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the charges made by companies such as the electricity boards and the gas hoards for the provision of their services is something which has been discussed in your lordships house on several occasions at question time <e> <s> and the case has been made perfectly clearly for the increases which were made by them <e> <s> in regard to the article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect both those questions are different questions and they go wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the fuel industries themselves to decide within their code of practice whether or not to disconnect a debtors supply <e> <s> and we have no power to intervene in individual cases <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> between november and november the rates of supplementary benefit were increased in value by per cent <e> <s> in real terms and my right honourable friend the secretary of state announced in another place on th june that the rates will be increased in november in line with the rise in the retail price index less housing costs <e> <s> in comparison under the last administration of the party opposite no real increase in these rates occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the views expressed by the committee <e> <s> but on the other hand as i said there has been considerable correspondence between my right honourable friend the minister of state for health and the committee and the fact is that the claims they make are not substantiated <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that they make a series of different claims <e> <s> another of their claims is that there are many doctors out of work <e> <s> on many occasions at the dispatch box i have answered questions about exactly that and there is not the evidence to support the claims they make <e> <s> certainly i am very happy to let the noble lord have a copy of the correspondence which deals very effectively with the claims that they make <e> <s> perhaps i ought to say also that i am aware of the fact that yesterday my right honourable friend met the junior hospital doctors committee <e> <s> i do not know what was the outcome of that but no doubt they made their claims then and they would have been dealt with by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i share entirely the noble baronesss views of the importance of the health service and those who work within it <e> <s> the fact is that there are improvements that can be made within the health service there always are and i am glad to see that the noble baroness agrees with me <e> <s> the fact is that the hospital junior staff committees claims have not been substantiated but my right honourable friend the minister of state for health has been in consultation with them and has explained the facts to them <e>", "<cs> my lords if the committee are able to produce any clear evidence then of course my right honourable friend will look into it but so far they have not been able to do so <e> <s> so far as excessive hours are concerned the problem is recognised and it is being tackled <e> <s> first of all the government have banned on-call rotas requiring junior doctors to be on duty more than one night and one weekend in two <e> <s> any such rotas are subject to strict central control as the noble lord will be aware <e> <s> secondly last year we asked health authorities to conduct a major review of the continuing need for rotas which were worse than a one-in-three basis and over the past months they succeeded in reducing these by per cent <e> <s> from approximately to <e> <s> finally we expect authorities to keep their rotas under close scrutiny especially where the doctors concerned spend a high proportion of their on-duty time working rather than just standing by <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may respond to the noble lord i should like to say that on the question of unemployment among doctors the bma distanced itself from what the junior hospital doctors claimed when they made their report last time <e> <s> as we know they are about to produce another report and certainly we shall be very interested to see what it says <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly work is being done on that but of course <e>", "<cs> it is strictly another question but i would be delighted to answer it if the noble lord would care to table a question on it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can respond to the noble lord by taking the amendment in two parts <e> <s> first perhaps i can explain that the provisions in subparagraphs and a in this amendment are superfluous <e> <s> it is a condition in clause that the panel as a whole should be representative of the area for which it sits <e> <s> it is therefore implicit that the groups mentioned in the noble lords amendment should be included on the panels and should be able to put forward nominations for members <e> <s> therefore we recognise the points that the noble lord lord dean of beswick makes but we consider that those points have already been met <e>", "<cs> the point that i made is that we want to broaden representation <e> <s> that is why i suggested that there were other groups such as the disabled single parents and others who could equally well be part of the group <e> <s> i do not for a moment imagine that i shall change the mind of the noble lord lord dean <e> <s> i am sure that he will divide the committee on this but there are one or two points on this that i can usefully make <e>", "<cs> no one is more aware than i am of the view that your lordships have expressed on numerous occasions let us hope not too numerous when retrospective legislation was discussed <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot match my noble friend lord morris with his mastery of latin but the noble lord has explained in moving the amendment that it is concerned with that part of the bill that would abolish the practice of franking as adopted by some occupational pension schemes <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend <e> <s> he asked for an assurance that the legislative change would not result in anyones pension being reduced <e> <s> i say to him that if the scheme is properly funded then no one will suffer <e> <s> if the scheme is not properly funded then all will suffer <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend has understood one point about it <e> <s> i appreciate as he does that it is an extremely complex area and i must confess that i do not even know whether my noble friend is total master of it i am not sure that i am myself <e> <s> but i think the point is that the legislation we are talking about affects future early leavers only <e> <s> it is retrospective only for their benefits which were understood to be provided as part of the contracting-out arrangements and it does not put a burden on schemes for past leavers <e> <s> i hope that is some reassurance for my noble friend <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend remind me precisely what that point was <e> <s> would that be the reduction in pension that i referred to <e> <s> does he want me to elaborate on that <e>", "<cs> i think i follow the noble lord but i do not think i can usefully add to what i have already said on this matter <e> <s> i think it would be best if i studied my noble friends remarks and wrote to him about this <e> <s> i am afraid that i stand by what i said earlier and i hope that with the assurance that i will write to explain matters my noble friend will see fit to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i fully accept the strong views of my noble friend lord ferrier and indeed my noble friend lord mottistone and the noble lord lord monson to say nothing of the opposition front bench so far as this particular amendment is concerned but the fact is that it would be a mistake to adopt this course innocuous as it does in fact seem because the words which form the short title of any bill do not have any particularly special significance <e> <s> the short title is not intended to detail all the contents of a bill <e> <s> as the noble lord described when he moved the amendment the long title covers a great many other aspects of a bill <e>", "<cs> i shall most certainly examine the matter again although i am afraid i shall probably find as my noble friend will expect that a great many other bills have passed through your lordships house over the years which do not in their short title encapsulate every part of the bill which is encapsulated in the long title <e> <s> the fact is that the long title is the fully descriptive title of the bill <e> <s> i will certainly examine what my noble friend has said but the title health and social security bill is for reference purposes and it is not designed to include every item which the bill proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords it has increased partly because the benefits too have increased enormously <e> <s> my noble friend lord cockfield referred to property owned by households fridges and so on <e> <s> i agree that the examples he gave are hardly signs of an impoverished nation <e> <s> they come to seem unremarkable because we so rapidly take for granted what previously were distant aspirations <e> <s> but of course there will always be some who are unable to provide for themselves the standards of living that the more fortunate regard as the norm <e> <s> this government have not turned their face against them nor flinched from the difficult task of steadily improving their lot <e> <s> across the whole field of social security and of health and personal social services our record stands comparison with that of any previous government and notably with that of the party opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for raising this important issue and to assure him that the government are fully committed to the rsu programme <e> <s> the establishment of a network of regional secure units is an integral part of a comprehensive range of services for care and treatment and it should not be seen in isolation from the mainstream of psychiatric care <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the quote but i shall certainly look into it and let the noble earl know <e> <s> on the capital side some million has been set aside for the building of permanent regional secure units of which over million has now been allocated <e> <s> a further million is likely to be allocated in the current financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a good point <e> <s> i should like to look into that i think it makes sense <e> <s> it works well so far as the special hospitals are concerned and i am thinking particularly of rampton <e> <s> i see no reason why it should not work and i shall look into it and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of course of the noble lords concern which i share for those who i think very rightly now leave the large mental hospitals and go into the community <e> <s> i do not think the situation is quite as bad generally as the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to tell the noble baroness in a short answer how it is going across the country specifically but generally it is working quite well <e> <s> we are taking steps to monitor this in the same way as we are taking steps to monitor specific cases such as those which the noble lord lord molloy mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper relates to the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to put down a question on the elderly i shall be delighted to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been the policy of successive governments to move mentally ill and mentally handicapped people who do not need to be in hospital into the community <e> <s> so far as residential mental nursing homes standards are concerned failure to maintain adequate standards could lead to registration being cancelled <e> <s> unregistered premises <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i certainly agree with my noble friend that only a very small number of people fall into this particular group <e> <s> as my noble friend will know this is a contributory benefit as opposed to a non-contributory one <e> <s> i have some sympathy with the view which my noble friend expresses <e> <s> but as she is aware a review is being undertaken at the moment by the department details of which were announced by my honourable friend the parliamentary secretary for social security on th may which will encompass the maternity benefits and payments administered by the department and the maternity pay scheme administered by the department of employment <e> <s> it will examine the scope for simplified administration and for making more effective use of the present resources <e> <s> i am sure that my honourable friend will wish the review to consider the suggestion of the eligibility of widowed mothers for overlapping benefits which i think is what my noble friend is looking for <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely share the views which the noble baroness expresses <e> <s> that is why the review has been set up to look into this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the last part of the supplementary question i am not sure of the answer but i will check and let the noble baroness know <e> <s> i know the dispute is affecting certain things but i do not know if it is particularly affecting those we are discussing <e> <s> so far as the comparative rates are concerned i do not think it would necessarily be right for me to give a table of the rates now but i can certainly let the noble baroness have them <e> <s> however the point is that it has always been the rule of our rather comprehensive social security system that there should not be two payments of benefit for the same purpose <e> <s> the point that we are essentially talking about here is the beneficiarys maintenance <e> <s> where a person qualifies for two national insurance benefits such as widows benefit and maternity allowance both of which are intended for that maintenance only the amount of the higher benefit is paid <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly ask my right honourable friend to look into this matter <e> <s> i am sure that he will read the exchanges <e> <s> i am well aware of my noble friends work for the national association of widows and i am sure that he will bear all that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are not aware of any undue stress produced by nurses working conditions <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but is is not just a question of giving it up <e> <s> there are those who take it up as well and the reasons for that are fairly complex <e> <s> there have been a number of reports on the matter and i think there is general agreement <e> <s> if i may quote from the introduction to a report in called <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords point but the fact is that they are not under the stress from which the noble lord describes them as suffering <e> <s> more nurses have been employed over the years as the noble lord knows <e> <s> i am well aware that there are certain parts of the nursing service which are stressful such as working with patients in psychiatry with patients in intensive care and so on but there is not the evidence to support the fact that they are taking up smoking because of stress particularly in these fields <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the underground is concerned i am delighted but that is a personal point of view <e> <s> so far as discouraging smoking among nurses is concerned the health education council which the government fund have taken a number of steps to discourage smoking among nurses and to develop their role in educating patients about the dangers of smoking which i think was a <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a feeling that anyway there are probably many nurses who take part in these operations who are smokers <e> <s> but anything that can be done to reduce smoking for the benefit both of people who smoke and for the health service is to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords lots of factors give rise to stress <e> <s> i am sure that in the end working conditions are more important than their accommodation where people relax and probably smoke at will anyway but i think the noble lords question is really a different one <e>", "<cs> my lords bullying and badgering is one thing encouragement is another <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not have a breakdown of the respective figures as between male and female nurses <e> <s> so far as snuff is concerned i know the noble lords particular views on snuff and there are others who support them <e> <s> i am sure that the nurses will note his view <e>", "<cs> my lords i would but i am not sure that everybody would agree with me <e>", "<cs> my lords there are hospitals with general accident and emergency or casualty departments within a three-mile radius of charing cross <e> <s> information on waiting times is not available centrally <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no departmental standards on what is an acceptable time for accident and emergency patients to wait <e> <s> clearly it depends very largely on the nature of the patients condition and that can be assessed as a matter of medical judgment only by the doctor on the spot <e> <s> one of the key jobs of the accident and emergency departments is to sort out the really ill patients who must be seen without delay from those who can safely wait for a little longer <e> <s> it is the health authoritys job to gear staffing to the workload of the department but peaks in numbers cannot always be predicted and at these times some delays may be unavoidable <e> <s> certainly it is a feature of the planning of the accident and emergency services that account is taken of the workload arising from the type of people to whom the noble baroness referred such as commuter influx holidaymakers and other casual attenders <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly the acheson report came up with a number of recommendations aimed at improving primary health care reducing the inappropriate use of a and e departments and improving communications between hospital and primary health care services <e> <s> the report has been recommended to health authorities and to family practitioner committees as well as a basis for action on those recommendations which fall within their sphere of responsibility <e> <s> additionally i ought to say that the government have made available an additional million in total over four years to improve primary health care services in inner cities <e>", "<cs> my lords the government certainly take it seriously as a matter of policy to ensure that there are sufficient facilities generally to cope with the problem <e> <s> but it is not always right as i think the noble lord will appreciate to lay down from the elephant and castle exactly how best a particular district health authority should meet problems in its area <e> <s> the departments policy is that an accident and emergency department should normally serve a population of at least but as i said in answer to the noble baroness lady masham this is not a rigid figure <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice i am afraid <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper specifically refers to hospitals in central london and i reject entirely the criticisms that the noble lord makes of the destruction of the health service so far as this and other matters are concerned <e> <s> over half-a-million more in-patients and day cases were treated in than in so that gives some weight to the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment specifically on the closure <e> <s> what i can say about st leonards is that i understand that some demonstrators there are protesting at the change of use of the hospital which was recently agreed by my right honourable friend the minister for health <e> <s> they are preventing certain staff from entering the hospital and the authority is seeking to have them removed <e> <s> but i have to say to the noble lord that the change of use was agreed after full consultation and referral to ministers <e> <s> so far as other hospitals are concerned i have no facts or figures on them but i shall find out and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the regional health authorities concerned will always be willing to speak to the people to whom the noble lord referred <e> <s> as he knows my right honourable friend the minister of state for health is also regularly in touch with the bma the junior doctors and so on <e> <s> but the fact remains that we are talking here about accident and emergency services only and not about general hospital closures <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to my noble friend lord cullen of ashbourne <e> <s> i understand and respect the strength of feeling behind his arguments <e> <s> what he said and what his amendment encapsulates is the quite different perceptions of what my noble friend and the government feel in the matter of optical appliances and their sale <e> <s> he seemed to indicate that he thinks we have gone too far yet the noble lord lord northfield does not feel that we have gone far enough <e> <s> but i do not think there is great merit in following that theme which is basically a second reading theme in much greater detail this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may respond to the noble lord <e> <s> that is a question of the implementation of british standards in the way that i have described to the noble lord <e> <s> i do not think that i have it wrong but as i understand it once the regulations have been made and british standards apply the local standards people presumably can look at them <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a little difficult to return to the dispatch box too often at report stage <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord lord northfield said that at all <e> <s> i thought that he did not follow the arguments which my noble friend lord cullen produced on this <e> <s> the fact is that every two years someone who is going to get glasses will have their eyes checked by someone who can test for the various factors and the things we discussed on the earlier amendments <e> <s> lenses will come from a prescription house <e> <s> there is a perfectly sound means of testing these lenses or prescribing them according to the prescriptions available and i do not think that i can really usefully add anything to what i said earlier <e> <s> we do not share the views and the worries which have been expressed by my noble friend lord cullen and others <e> <s> we believe that what we are adopting is the <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord ennals will know there are two aspects to our policy on the supply of glasses under the national health service <e> <s> clause of the bill represents one strand <e> <s> it will liberalise the private market and enable the present system of state provision of antiquated glasses supplied at a subsidised price to cease <e> <s> the other strand is schedule <e> <s> it demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that there will be no financial barrier placed between vulnerable sections of the public and the glasses they need <e>", "<cs> my lords it is <e> <s> i am unable to find it in the bill at the moment but perhaps i may come back to the point in a minute or two <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals also raised a different point relating to complex lenses <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it this provision is not contained in the bill <e> <s> it is included in existing legislation which covers the way in which these lenses are prescribed through the hospital service <e> <s> if i have misled the noble lord that is entirely my fault and i accept that it is my fault <e> <s> however the fact is that it is for the hospital to supply what is needed to patients who have had operations to their eyes <e>", "<cs> my lords if with the leave of the house i may respond again i am not sure that the noble lord lord ross of marnock is entirely correct <e> <s> i do not know about his particular circumstances and it would be wrong of me to go into them but the fact is that under the national health service act it is up to the hospital to continue this treatment <e> <s> if the noble lord has a particular problem because the system has not worked in his particular case i should be very happy to look into it <e> <s> however those who have had cataract operations are provided for <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house may i say that i am in some difficulty at report stage in having to jump up and down in order to answer a point which relates specifically to a problem experienced by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> it seems to me that that is what i am being asked to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly look into any particular problem which the noble lord has experienced <e> <s> however it does not affect people generally <e> <s> the law relating to hospital services has not been changed <e> <s> the bill affects only the general ophthalmic services <e> <s> hospital eye service glasses can be dispensed by private opticians but the health authority meets the cost <e> <s> if i can help the noble lord over a particular problem <e> <s> i shall be delighted to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it i am sure that i am not wrong about this the problems which follow an operation are dealt with in the way i have described <e> <s> the noble lord shakes his head but i am afraid tht the noble lord is not necessarily correct in shaking his head <e> <s> the matter is covered by the provisions which i have just described <e> <s> the bill in no way affects them because the bill is concerned with the general ophthalmic service <e> <s> it is not concerned with the law relating to the hospital services which are maintained under the national health service act <e> <s> whether or not the eyes settle down after a period of one year or two years depends very much upon the eyes of the individual person <e> <s> i do not think that i can usefully follow that particular point any further <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to tell my noble friend that i have no objection to his amendments on grounds of policy <e> <s> they would make no material difference to the effect of the clause <e> <s> the main effect would be to use in this statute the somewhat archaic if that is the right word drafting style of the act with its redundant phrases <e> <s> changing the word using of the title optician to taking or using would not add any real protection since without using the title the taking of it would be ineffective <e> <s> similarly adding the wording either alone or with other words adds nothing of substance <e> <s> it merely uses several words in place of a few <e> <s> similarly the use of the positive expression have been unreasonable in place of not have been reasonable is merely i suggest to my noble friend a matter of taste more than substance <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i can respond to one or two points <e> <s> the noble lord lord northfield knows as well as i do that really we are leaving this amendment and going back to a matter of principle which has been discussed on more than one occasion <e> <s> i hope your lordships will forgive me if i do not follow him down that road <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to consider the case of old age pensioners <e> <s> as a group old age pensioners have never received free glasses <e> <s> they have been liable to the same charges as any other users of national health service glasses <e> <s> entitlement to remission of charges has been linked to income since <e> <s> i suggest that there is even less reason for free glasses for pensioners in than in <e> <s> the charge for a simple pair of lenses in was <e> <s> the pension for a single person was <e> <s> in other words it took over five days pension to pay for those lenses <e> <s> today a simple pair of private glasses can be bought in london for <e> <s> the pension is now <e> <s> such glasses therefore cost under three days pension <e> <s> there is every reason to believe that following the injection of greater competition this will become the norm <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the concern which the noble baroness expresses in bringing forward this amendment again that the government should operate the control of cash limits in a way which encourages sound financial management and value for money <e> <s> i understand that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may explain that <e> <s> the problem here is one of disagreement <e> <s> if there is a disagreement on this particular matter between the health authority and the secretary of state then it would have to come before parliament to be resolved because that is the effect of sub-paragraph ii of the amendment which says <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may in approaching these two amendments together deal particularly first with the question of opticians which was one of the points which the noble lord lord ennals raised <e> <s> i shall then come on to the main theme of the arguments of the noble lords lord renton and lord ennals <e> <s> i know that the opticians are apprehensive about this clause so far as it affects them specifically and its possible application to the question of the discounts they have received on the prices paid for spectacle frames and lenses <e> <s> the rates at which they are reimbursed for these items are intended to cover only the cost of the opticians but we believe that the opticians may have profited from discounts from their suppliers <e> <s> the sum of million is currently being withheld from arrears of fees until we can establish how much may have been overpaid <e> <s> an inquiry into the actual amounts paid by opticians for their supplies has recently been completed and we shall now be discussing with the opticians representatives the scale of the problem <e> <s> we shall await the outcome of these negotiations before deciding the extent if any to which remuneration should be adjusted to cover any amounts overpaid <e> <s> but i must make it clear that the government has a duty to <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i offered my noble friend an explanation about the drafting <e> <s> i will certainly ask the draftsmen to look <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house there is a difficulty in my following the course which the noble lord asks me to follow <e> <s> that is for the reasons which i explained when we debated the matter earlier and which i think my noble friend lord renton accepts <e> <s> i do understand the position that in this case the court did not allow the expedition but the noble lord will be aware that it is very difficult for me to talk as my noble friend lord renton says about the merits of the legislation because it is still to some extent in train and the case does not come up until december <e> <s> so i would be stepping out of line if i were to go further than i have gone in discussing the legal position <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am not sure really that there is much to be gained by hypothecating on what might be the case if this particular clause were not in the bill <e> <s> the fact is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether i am in order or not but as i understand it the deputy speaker has said that it would not be possible to accept amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am sure he is right so i do not think the noble baroness is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth and the noble lord lord henderson and others have expressed an understandable concern over the way that the easier age rule for sda will operate in relation to those in further education or training <e> <s> perhaps the first point to emphasise therefore is that someone undergoing a course of education would not necessarily be unable to qualify for sda on the easier rules <e> <s> having said that i hope i shall answer all the points that the noble baroness asked me to not i hasten to add necessarily in the order in which she asked them but i hope that what i have said will at the end of the day be at least clear <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to say to the noble baroness that as she realises i cannot go on at too great length at this stage <e> <s> we discussed some of this before <e> <s> severe disablement allowance is intended to be an income maintenance benefit primarily for people of working age who are congenitally handicapped and have never been capable of work <e> <s> given this priority the logical cut-off point i think we covered this ground before for the easier qualifying condition is rather than <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i say that i share the desire which underlies this amendment to increase the understanding of the general public and of those organisations representing disabled people about sda and in particular about the way in which the disablement test will apply <e> <s> in this connection i hope that the explanations which i have already given at earlier stages to your lordships and which have also been made in another place and in meetings and correspondence with the various voluntary organisations will have gone a long way towards easing the concerns which have been expressed <e>", "<cs> negative my lords <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord morris started by asking why the stages of the bill had been compressed <e> <s> it is quite true that the interval which has elapsed since the end of the committee stage is only seven days whereas the recommended minimum interval is days <e> <s> i regret very much any inconvenience that as a result might have been caused to your lordships but i think i should point out that it was necessary at the committee stage to arrange for more time to be set aside than had originally been contemplated <e> <s> in particular the very last part of the committee stage was deferred until a week ago but all the rest of the bill had been considered by st june since when some two weeks and five days have elapsed <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i answer one point that the noble baroness lady jeger raised <e> <s> she asked whether anyones pension would be reduced as a result of these proposals <e> <s> pensions can only be reduced if the scheme rules permit them to he reduced <e> <s> it depends on the scheme <e> <s> most scheme rules refuse amendments which will cause a beneficiary to be worse off as a result of a change in the rules <e> <s> to that extent future pension increases will be reduced without the proposals which we have included in this bill <e> <s> i hope that that answers the point that she raised <e>", "<cs> my lords our amendments to the opticians act remove the total ban on the sale or <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i must get this absolutely right <e> <s> i was not aware that anyone had insulted anybody at committee stage <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend lord mottistone is not suggesting that my noble friend lord caithness insulted him <e>", "<cs> my lords in the past rawp targets were calculated on historical population data although we did take account of population growth in making actual allocations <e> <s> next year we shall be using population projections in the formula and this should take a better account of expected population growths <e> <s> i hope that that answers my noble friends first question <e>", "<cs> my lords rawp stands for the resource allocation working party <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not accept that because the thames regions are receiving no growth this year and can expect reduced allocations in future they have no scope for improving services <e> <s> that is of course the important fact <e> <s> we are requiring all authorities to undertake a sustained cost improvement programme to release resources for improving patient service and we shall look to the thames regions to tackle that vigorously <e> <s> i think that there is still too much emphasis on the need for additional resources without making the best use of what we already have <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but we are talking about the fact that historically london has been overprovided because there has been a move away from london and the regions have been underfunded <e> <s> that is why it is necessary to do it this way <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps progress towards rawp has been too slow <e> <s> as the noble lord will appreciate the fact is that it is not a perfect science <e> <s> he will also know that i have on many occasions rehearsed the achievements towards not just increased expenditure to the national health service throughout the country but also in particular as against closing hospitals opening new ones <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the generous remarks of the noble lord lord ennals when he started his speech in support of this amendment <e> <s> i am afraid i shall to some extent have to disappoint him <e> <s> to deal first of all with the drafting point clause puts beyond argument the existing long-standing remuneration arrangements and they are long-standing for the four nhs contractor professions <e> <s> the amendment seeks to delete this subsection of clause which provides a general validation of the established remuneration arrangements and is i am afraid rather technical <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not think i can go very far but one of the major reasons for the present position as i have already described is that the agreed discount inquiry was delayed by the pharmacists themselves and when the results eventually became available the sums owed b pharmacists were extremely large <e> <s> in an effort to avoid a repetition of such a state negotiations have commenced as i have said on a new form of contract with the pharmacists <e> <s> one of the major features of the new contract is expected to be negotiations to set an annual timetable linked to regular and frequent inquiries thus avoiding for the future the build-up of large over- and under-payments <e> <s> i do not really think i can go much farther than that but i hope it is some comfort to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i fully understand and accept my noble friends earlier remarks <e> <s> he need not worry that offence was taken <e> <s> it was late at night and it is also fairly late in the parliamentary year <e> <s> everybody tends to get rather exhausted at that time of night <e>", "<cs> noble lords and noble baronesses opposite look very happy with that and i am delighted to see it <e> <s> but as i said on two earlier occasions the intention of subsections and of this clause is to carry into the public sector the wider <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i was looking for a moment to stand up to give an answer to the noble baroness <e> <s> the situation is that dispensing opticians contracted to the general optical service under the national health service act are those who are registered with the general optical council <e> <s> this clause will allow those who sell glasses privately without being registered to supply them also as national health service contractors <e> <s> sight testing is the role of ophthalmic opticians <e> <s> nothing in the bill affects who can test sight i am sure the noble baroness is aware of that or who can test sight under the national health service <e> <s> i hope that that explains the point which the noble baroness made <e> <s> we are talking about two slightly different matters <e> <s> when she reads what i have said i hope that it will make sense to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that my noble friend lord morris feels it necessary to raise this matter again <e> <s> for the benefit of your lordships who may have forgotten if they were here when some of the issues were discussed i think i ought to make one or two things plain <e>", "<cs> my lords did i <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend has got it wrong <e> <s> such a person will eventually reach the age known as the state pensionable age <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness it is the last thing i want to do but the fact is that other members of your lordships house have not had the benefit of reading all that this letter contains <e> <s> the fact is that it deals with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am the first to recognise that this is a wide-ranging bill <e> <s> i do not think it would he appropriate for me to detain your lordships at this stage for yet another detailed exposition of its contents or even of what its contents might have been had the noble baroness lady jeger had her way <e> <s> i was chided by the noble lord lord kilmarnock to the effect not that it was a ragbag of a bill which my noble friend lord ferrier said but that it was a dogs breakfast <e> <s> all i can say is that if it had had the various additions which the noble baroness lady jeger had wanted the dog would have done very well in the morning <e>", "<cs> my lords the facts do not support what the noble lord says and there are plenty of facts <e> <s> if the noble lord wants me to rehearse a whole list of improvements that have been made to the health service since this government came to office i could do so but i do not think that it would necessarily benefit the rest of the house <e> <s> to turn to the unemployment of doctors the fact is that if there is significant unemployment and there are no indications to say that there is it is probably in those parts of the country where doctors do not want to work and the unemployment is also probably temporary <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows the fact is that the system for recording these vacancies was changed to a voluntary one and that is the reason why those figures are not now available <e> <s> but the fact also is that the number of staff unemployed is not what the noble lord says it is <e> <s> i could certainly give the noble lord a long list of figures but i would rather give them to him in writing than quote them to him now over the dispatch box <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for my noble friends remarks <e> <s> the fact is that a total of nearly million cases are dealt with at hospitals as <e>", "<cs> my lords there are various estimates floating around one of which has been as the noble lord says that the bma suggested that there were people unemployed <e> <s> it was the bma junior doctors who completed that survey <e> <s> it is also interesting to note that the bma distanced itself from those figures <e>", "<cs> yes my lords they did <e> <s> there has been no evidence to suggest that those figures are correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for my noble friends intervention <e> <s> whereas capital spending under the labour government was slashed and that is not too strong a word by per cent <e> <s> it is now up by over per cent <e> <s> since <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the fact is that i shall now have to start swapping further statistics with the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> the facts do not support the allegations at all <e> <s> the fact is that employment has gone up and the fact is too that the number of patients who have been treated in hospital and in other ways has also increased <e> <s> if there have been cuts they have been in waste and not in anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have told the noble lord lord molloy on numerous occasions there are continual contacts between the department of health and social security and all the representatives that he has just named <e> <s> that will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i share all my noble friends views on how awful it is for all those who are concerned with cot deaths <e> <s> the foundation for the study of infant deaths plays a key role in promoting research into sudden infant deaths and the department encourages the foundation in its work <e> <s> to help the foundation cope with an increased demand for its welfare and counselling activities we have awarded a grant of towards the cost of appointing a full-time professional officer <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will find that encouraging <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be true in regard to a small proportion of sudden infant deaths <e> <s> the fact is that there is no precise cause of cot deaths or at least none which has been isolated so far <e> <s> in fact there may be several associated factors <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think there is <e> <s> perinatal deaths are another matter but in regard to cot deaths there does not apppear to be any particular geographical disposition <e>", "<cs> my lords dr morleys current work is in the field of infant lung coatings and respiratory distress syndrome among premature babies rather than in the field of what is commonly referred to as cot deaths <e> <s> the medical research council declined to fund his recent application to pursue a hypothesis linking this work with cot deaths <e> <s> that decision was made on scientific grounds <e> <s> it is unfortunate that the current medical research council funded work should have been so firmly identified in the media with cot deaths <e> <s> i think there has been misrepresentation to some extent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord is not correct on that <e> <s> the fact is that the three proposals were not connected with cot deaths <e> <s> one was merely linked with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of that <e> <s> but certainly i shall look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in answer to the noble lady lady saltoun there are many factors which lead to these deaths and i dare say that the factors to which the noble lord has referred are included <e> <s> but a great deal of important data has been brought together on the subject and officials at the department of health are considering with a team at sheffield how the material can be best further analysed and exploited <e> <s> following their report which is expected by the end of the year the department is intending to sponsor a seminar to discuss possible future studies based on the information which is now available <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that that is possibly another question because when it comes to sudden infant deaths if the child is not well anyway then presumably he will be under the care of his own doctor <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be one of the factors that contribute to some of these cot deaths but we do not really know <e> <s> so far as passing on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft social security benefits up-rating order be approved <e> <s> the order is accompanied by a report from the government actuary on the effects of the up-rating on the national insurance fund and by a statement on the uprating of mobility allowance <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady jeger said this is the last opportunity to discuss these rather complex matters in this session <e> <s> i have to say that there was an opportunity which was not taken up to go through the subject when the up-rating statement was made <e> <s> if i am unable to answer all the points that have been raised on the seven motions i shall follow them up in correspondence <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a feeling that i gave the figure to the noble lord before <e> <s> it was the figure i was given <e> <s> i will certainly check on it and if it was wrong or misleading i will come back to him in writing <e> <s> i should say to the noble baroness that since we came into office we have managed to increase the real value of the scale rates by some per cent <e> <s> those with children have done even better with an increase of some per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said was that the short term surpluses and deficits on the national insurance fund have never been a factor in setting benefit rates <e>", "<cs> my lords it really turns on the general question which was asked by the noble earl lord longford and that was if i understood him correctly that this government in the noble earls words seek to reduce public expenditure <e> <s> the fact remains that there are a number of benefits which are being reviewed by my right honourable friend at the moment with a view it is hoped to trying to make them less complex which will probably help all of us in this house and others as well <e> <s> but money does not grow on trees and the important point is to target the benefits in the right direction <e> <s> they are very expensive <e> <s> as i said when i moved the orders <e> <s> they account now for a total bill of million a year <e> <s> that is a considerable sum of money <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may return to that question in a moment becase it is a complex area and one in which i should like to be particularly certain that i give the noble lord the right answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that perhaps the noble baroness reads rather too much into the report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords there is something to be said for being in credit rather than being in debt <e> <s> the fact is as i have said that this is invested in government stock <e> <s> we have to maintain a balance in the fund <e> <s> it is taken into account as i said when the rates are looked at <e> <s> i agree that it is a highly technical area and one in which the noble lord in his wisdom <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> if i have the noble lord wrong <e> <s> i will study his particular remarks and come back to him <e>", "<cs> yes my lords per week <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilmarnock inquired about unemployment benefit payments in arrears <e> <s> the fact is that at the start of a claim most people have just finished work and they have money in their pockets <e> <s> this change with extra money at the end of the claim will mean that fewer people need to claim supplementary benefit for deferred earnings <e> <s> the only exceptions are people who are now over-paid and they will lose the over-payments <e> <s> so the only losses are the overpayments which are stopped <e> <s> that is the meat of it my lords at most one weeks benefit per person or about and the average loss is likely to be around <e> <s> the fact is that when a person starts his period of unemployment he is more likely to have money in his pocket than he is at the end of the period <e> <s> that is why this change which is essentially an administrative one has been carried out <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend that this is a very serious matter <e> <s> but because drug misuse is largely illegal prevalence is difficult to measure and the main indicators available relate to seizures and to notifications to the home office <e> <s> in seizures were the highest ever recorded and as my noble friend said notifications were up by per cent <e> <s> on <e> <s> i think my noble friend will be aware that both the home office and the department of health and social security have taken a number of steps to try to meet this very serious problem <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the customs as the noble lord will know the uniformed branch was not achieving the results which ought to have been achieved <e> <s> that is why it has been necessary to re-target these people to the intelligence world if that is the right word to use which might meet the problem rather better <e> <s> but as it is the home office has doubled our contribution to the united nations fund for drug abuse control it has provided another million for rural development programmes and to strengthen law enforcement efforts in pakistan it has posted a british customs liaison officer to karachi it has posted a senior british police officer to the netherlands and it has decided to ratify the convention on psychotropic substances which of course extends controls to synthetic drugs <e> <s> so far as <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the circular to which i referred was so that the health authorities could liaise with the local authorities on just that type of problem and so yes they will be involved <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am sure that will be possible <e> <s> that sort of thing will be taken into account and i shall see that that is arranged <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i shall certainly make sure that that is looked into <e> <s> i was not aware that there was a variation in price in the way that the right reverend prelate describes but i shall look into it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i share my noble friends view <e> <s> in response to the prevention report from the advisory council my right honourable friend the home secretary has set up an interdepartmental group chaired by my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state at the home office to develop the governments overall strategy in the fight against drug abuse and i am sure this will prove a great success <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i entirely agree <e> <s> it is a terrible business and that is why we are taking the action which we have embarked upon <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot go further than i have already gone <e> <s> but as the noble lord will be aware the binder hamlyn report is concerned with the financial control of family practitioner services overall and as i have said it is just one of the issues which need to be considered in relation to the development of primary health care <e> <s> the purpose of the green paper to which i referred in the original answer and that approach is to bring these particular strands together and the binder hamlyn report is being studied in this wider context <e>", "<cs> my lords it really is a matter for my right honourable friend to decide when he wishes and if he wishes to publish a particular report <e> <s> as i have said a green paper is being published <e> <s> what goes into that green paper will no doubt to some extent reflect what is in the binder hamlyn report <e> <s> the two are interconnected <e> <s> in that respect while i am quite sure that my right honourable friend will note the concern of the noble lord lord ennals i can give no further commitment than i have already given <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is aware of what my right honourable friend said earlier on this year and also of what has been said subsequently <e> <s> i am afraid that i have nothing to add to either of those statements <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the noble lords particular expertise in this matter <e> <s> but the question of cash limiting the family practitioner services was one of the options which binder hamlyn were asked to look at and until we have completed our study of the report and the other issues which are related to it no decisions will be taken on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i can go no further than i have already gone and the noble lord will have to wait and see <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i did not hear the first part of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> if he would like to repeat it i will try to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government commission reports from all sorts of sources from time to time and i see no reason why this report should be treated in any way differently from the others <e> <s> so i am sorry but the noble lord will have to wait and see when and if it is published <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is surmising at what might be done <e>

the noble lord opposite <e> <s> what my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer announced at the end of july was that expenditure was then between some million to million <e> <s> i have no more up-to-date figures at the present time to give the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the reserve to which the noble lord refers is set at billion in last years public expenditure white paper <e> <s> so far programme increases amounting to some billion have have been charged to the reserve to meet part of the cost of various other items <e> <s> there are other potential charges of which i suppose the miners strike is one but amounts are less certain <e> <s> the total position is being monitored closely <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for those who made that assessment <e>

expenditure that had then been incurred <e> <s> it is not quite what the noble lord lord bruce would understand as a book figure because if we take the total overall cost figure the figure that i gave is reduced by the stock rundown and cut back in capital investment programmes <e> <s> so the figures will not actually show up in the profit and loss account <e> <s> however i hope that answers the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords it includes those costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that those responsible will note the noble lords remarks <e> <s> i am well aware of the noble lords particular interest and experience in financial matters <e> <s> the fact is that it is best to wait until the end of the day to establish exactly what has been the total cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will realise that the government will of course act within the law when it comes to considering what is to be done about the costs <e> <s> as i have said no decisions on electricity price increases have been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i think that he is absolutely right <e> <s> the principle is an all-important one that is why we must do all that we possibly can to ensure that this dispute is brought to a speedy conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord will realise that that is a different question <e>", "<cs> my lords we all deplore the fact that the strike at newcastle has caused such worry and inconvenience to the public <e> <s> we have however managed to maintain a service to beneficiaries and we are making every effort to end the dispute <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not <e> <s> i certainly shall from this dispatch box deplore the fact that people are being inconvenienced in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the first thing to say to the noble baroness is that certainly in no way are we doing anything other than to try to bring the dispute to a speedy conclusion <e> <s> the fact is that acas has been involved <e> <s> the noble baroness might like to know that this is a move unprecedented in the civil service and that the department remains prepared to resume negotiations at any time and of course as i said earlier we hope for a speedy settlement <e> <s> i should like to join with the noble baroness in paying tribute to the dhss and the post office staff who are making a great effort to allow us to operate the contingency arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said acas has already been involved in the strike <e> <s> as i have also said we are prepared to resume negotiations at any time <e> <s> we hope for an early settlement <e> <s> the fact is that the offer made to the unions means that no existing shift workers need lose take-home pay if they accept the new arrangements <e> <s> as to the effect of the dispute on overseas pensioners i can tell the noble lord that about pensioners are affected of whom approximately per cent <e> <s> are being paid following application to the overseas branch at newcastle and this figure is rising all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that there is <e> <s> i do not actually have the details with me <e> <s> the fact is that the normal procedures were exhausted <e> <s> that is why it was necessary to take the unprecedented step of involving acas <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not accept what the noble lord says <e> <s> in this dispute the unions appear to want the existing shift patterns to be set for all time <e> <s> obviously this questions managements right to manage <e> <s> this is something that the department cannot and should not accept <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i agree entirely with my noble friend <e> <s> i have had a vast amount of correspondence on the subject <e> <s> many people have been very distressed by it <e> <s> nevertheless i think it is true that the emergency arrangements which we put in train for these occasions have been working better and better as time has gone by <e> <s> i only hope as i said earlier that the strike can be brought to a speedy conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords it would take me more than a minute or two to go into the details for the noble baroness but i should be very happy to correspond with her on this particular point <e> <s> the fact is that recently only last week my department wrote yet again to the general secretary of cpsa outlining the various factors which were involved and hoping that it would be possible to make some sensible progress <e> <s> i have not got in front of me the details of the acas arrangements but i can say yes acas has been involved <e>", "<cs> my lords we are getting fairly wide of the mark on this but the post office has announced that it would be wrong to close post offices while the additional work resulting from the dispute which the post office estimates at some per cent <e> <s> was causing long queues and increased waiting times <e> <s> further closure of crown offices will therefore be deferred until the dispute and its aftermath have been resolved <e> <s> similarly in regard to sub-postmasters who have agreed to closure the post office will be seeking to persuade as many as possible to remain open until the dispute is resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords no general guidelines have been issued but in some cases there is a statutory requirement for industries to consult consumer interests before changes in tariffs are implemented <e> <s> additionally i understand that non-statutory arrangements for consultation exist in a number of industries <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness is hinting that bt may not have complied with the conditions of its licence in terms of the recently announced prices increases i have to tell her that this is a matter for the director general of telecommunications <e> <s> british telecommunications profits were million in <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that british telecom made a profit of million has to be seen in the context of the rate of return that that represents upon the net current cost assets employed <e> <s> i think too that the noble baroness will realise that when we are talking about a profit of million for bt bts massive investments and the massive scale of its business requirements are such that that kind of profit is not as extravagant or as vast as the noble baroness suggests it is <e> <s> the fact is that bt accounted for some per cent <e> <s> of the income-based gross domestic product in <e> <s> that is a very substantial amount <e> <s> i think that the figures which i have quoted simply illustrate the fact that the investment and the size of the operation are so enormous <e>", "<cs> my lords i remember having many exchanges with the noble lord lord bruce over the passage of that bill <e> <s> as he will know bt is a public limited company <e> <s> it is wholly owned by the government operating under the terms and conditions of a licence granted by the secretary of state for trade and industry <e> <s> there are restrictions on the extent to which bt can increase the prices of certain of its telephone services but those controls are monitored and enforced by the director general of telecommunications <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i had better wait until next week but i shall look forward to what the noble baroness has to say then <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> off the top of my head i am not quite clear how precisely it could be done but i should have thought that this is a matter which could be given consideration by the industries concerned particularly when they produce rather easily understood glossy brochures illustrating exactly what their profits have been <e> <s> i am sure that they will bear my noble friends remarks in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord that in regard to the electricity industry the rate of return was about per cent <e> <s> and i think that the figure for the gas industry was about per cent <e> <s> but i might need to check on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly echo the views of all those who have expressed gratitude to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for raising this important matter this evening <e> <s> i do so because the government have always recognised that the contribution of the voluntary sector is an essential complement and supplement to the work of the statutory services <e> <s> i would be the first to agree with the right reverend prelate the bishop of chichester about their long history in this field <e> <s> a significant feature of the governments policy has been to encourage greater co-operation between the statutory and voluntary sectors <e> <s> as my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services said when addressing the social services conference at buxton recently the increasing pressures which we face in the health and personal social services make it essential for <e>", "<cs> my lords if i can just continue with what i was going to say i hope that might be clear to the noble earl in a moment <e> <s> while not superseding the close links which individual voluntary organisations have with the government departments with which they deal the voluntary services unit is the core funding body for organisations whose activities cover the interests of several departments for example the national council for voluntary organisations and the volunteer centre <e> <s> organisations like these provide the essential networks for government initiatives in the voluntary sector <e> <s> these bodies such as the ncvo and the volunteer centre do liaise with all departments as my noble friend lady faithfull would like them to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the point which the noble baroness makes <e> <s> i am not quite sure what the answer is but perhaps i can let her know <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i could usefully follow the noble lord down the road which he seeks to take me at the moment on this theme <e> <s> perhaps i may say that the rates act makes ample provision for any authority which considers that it cannot live within the expenditure level determined for it to apply for such a redetermination <e> <s> if however an authority chooses not to apply for a redetermination we can only assume that it does not do so because it considers that it can live within the external limit determined for it and then the secretary of state is denied that opportunity to have regard to contributions to charities in reaching a decision as to the authoritys expenditure level <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the first question for obvious reasons i have not in front of me the relevant quotations for all the debates which took place in your lordships house <e> <s> i shall study my noble friends points and let her know the answer and i shall read the remarks to see what was said on those occasions <e> <s> as she indicated the debate goes far wider than just the dhss the home office or indeed the department of the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly shall <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his kind remarks but i do not think that i can give him all the details that he wants in a short answer now from the dispatch box <e> <s> regarding the extra money the level of our contributions to the multilateral organisations concerned will be decided in the light of our assessment of the individual programmes <e> <s> the most general need is to give help to developing country governments in understanding population issues in dealing with their problems and in assisting individual couples to choose voluntarily the number and spacing of their children <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the first part of the noble baronesss supplementary question <e> <s> if one looks at population trends throughout the world the population will have risen to million by the end of the year <e> <s> that is almost double what it was in <e> <s> regarding increasing aid this is more a matter for my honourable friend the minister for overseas development and i am sure that he will note what the noble baroness has said <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not share the view that economic development alone will automatically bring about a slowing of the rate of population growth in the developing world <e> <s> we believe that population programmes make an active contribution to social as well as economic development and must be urgently pursued for those as well as humanitarian reasons <e> <s> that is the short answer to the noble lords supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with much of what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> however i hope that she will note that in the light of the enormous increase in numbers that we expect between now and the year some help advice and education should be given where it is possible to do so to those in the countries most directly concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most interesting idea <e> <s> how far it can be pursued elsewhere i am not quite sure <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very good point and it is certainly the case that there is no coercion in this matter at all <e> <s> it is very much a question of the countries themselves deciding how best they can be helped <e>", "<cs> my lords when i spoke earlier i said how much i looked forward to hearing the comments to be made this afternoon and i for one have not been disappointed <e> <s> i have learned a great deal and i am grateful as we all will be to all those who have taken part in this stimulating debate for their constructive and very profound views which of course the government will study most carefully <e> <s> it is not easy to wind-up a debate which has expressed those very profound views and if i am unable to mention all those who have taken part it in no way reflects upon the content of their speech merely on the constraints of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment upon the turn of phrase which the noble earl uses <e> <s> what is important is that the consultation process should be complete before we decide upon any of the suggestions which have been put forward today by the noble earl and others <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly we have asked for some clarification on the particular issue which the noble lord raises about new housing <e> <s> there has been no evidence in the past that the commission is challenging the legality of zero rating for new housing but as i have said we have asked for clarification of that issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly cannot give those figures to the noble lord <e> <s> but as i said the government do not accept the commissions view and they see no reason to implement the changes because of it <e>", "<cs> my lords the question relates to the particular issue of the eec which i think i have answered <e> <s> the noble lord is leading us down a different path <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend that question goes slightly wider than the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we feel that primary care is important <e> <s> but it is equally important to ensure that the primary care services are reviewed really thoroughly and that we produce sound proposals which will provoke a wide-ranging debate in the sort of time frame which i should think the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be very surprised if the noble lord when he was a secretary of state did not commission reports of some sort that were not in fact published <e> <s> of course the government commission lots of reports <e> <s> the fact is that there is no obligation necessarily to publish them <e> <s> so far as the binder hamlyn report is concerned it deals with the forecasting and control of expenditure on the family practitioner services <e> <s> this is just one of the issues which need to be considered in relation to primary health care as i think the noble lord himself would agree <e> <s> the purpose of the green paper appoach as i have said at this box more than once is to bring all these strands together <e> <s> the binder hamlyn report is being studied in the wider context <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not really believe all the leaks that i hear and i am sure that the noble lord does not either <e>", "<cs> my lords the delay is purely so that the green paper can be cast in the sort of terms which the noble lord would want <e> <s> i think that is more important than artificial timetables which is what the noble lord and some of the noble lords opposite seem to want more importantly <e>", "<cs> my lords the canadian department of health and welfare has prepared the draft of a reciprocal agreement on social security which would provide for pension increases for united kingdom pensioners in canada <e> <s> the test is currently the subject of negotiation between officials of my department and our canadian counterparts <e> <s> the implementation of any agreement will depend on the necessary finance becoming available <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of what the noble lord says <e> <s> in principle the government accept the case for a comprehensive social security convention with canada which would enable the sort of increases to which he refers to be paid <e> <s> however as i have said the problem is one of priorities and the allocation of funds <e> <s> the potential cost to the united kingdom of such a convention would be over million a year estimated at rates of benefit and until funds are available that cannot be done <e>", "<cs> my lords although pensioners in canada are not making use of the national health service and united kingdom social services it is not really possible to trade one thing off totally against another in the way the noble baroness suggests <e> <s> besides the fact that one cannot quantify the savings on services the financial arrangements for cash benefits are quite different <e> <s> the national health service and social services are part of the social structure of the country available to residents and are financed as such <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that partial unfreezing the technical term i think for what the noble lord is getting at would initially cost less than total unfreezing <e> <s> it would cost about million in the first year <e> <s> however ultimately the annual cost would be the same as for a total unfreezing <e> <s> in the present situation the government cannot make such a commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the chairman of the national health service management board in the dhss is concerned it is important to fill this post with the right person <e> <s> that is more important than to make the appointment quickly because as the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords the ructions to which the noble lord refers are not nearly so serious as he seems to think they are <e> <s> my right honourable friend is in touch with all the bodies to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly cannot give the noble baroness information about the specific appointment to which she referred <e> <s> however among regional general managers appointed so far there are an ex-regional medical officer an ex-regional nursing officer and two former treasurers <e> <s> of the district general managers who have been appointed one is a former district treasurer and three come from outside the health service altogether <e> <s> so the situation is not as bad as some people think it is <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in answer to the noble lord lord hunters earlier question the important thing is to obtain the right person for the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord quotes th april <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not have with me the exact date when the appointment was advertised but it must have been round about then <e> <s> the reason is exactly the same as the one i gave just now to the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> people who possess the quality that this responsibility requires do not come easily and it is absolutely essential that we get the right person <e> <s> as i explained it was perhaps unfortunate that the delay has been so long but it was necessary in this particular case <e> <s> as i said the appointments are made by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> the noble lord asked another supplementary question <e> <s> perhaps he will repeat it and then i can answer him <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord a figure off the top of my head <e> <s> of course ministers remain ultimately responsible for the management and efficiency of the health service centrally and that is why it is important for ministers to scrutinise many of these appointments <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the cascade principle of appointing regional managers to be followed by general managers to be followed in turn by district general managers of which many appointments are now under way ultimately to be followed by the appointment of general managers for units is the way that we should go <e> <s> it is clear from discussions that we have had with regional health authority chairmen that they prefer that way too <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness is absolutely right <e> <s> it is a sensitive matter because it involves a fairly substantial difference and i am quite sure it is one in the right direction <e> <s> i entirely agree with her that everything ought to be done to promote harmony within the service <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very much a matter for them to decide whether the salaries are comparable <e> <s> there are those who have come from outside and i shall be happy to let my noble friend have the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords the appointment of regional general managers is for regions and for my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i am not totally aware of my noble friends comment when he spoke earlier but in due course i shall make myself aware of them <e> <s> however i must tell the noble baroness that the consumers association the national consumer council together with the national consumer protection council were consulted before the coins were issued <e> <s> they were invited to make comments and in fact at that time they showed little interest <e> <s> i have to tell the noble baroness that none of the organisations was specifically asked to comment on the coin once it had actually been issued <e> <s> as regards scotland of course it is up to the directors and shareholders of the banks to decide whether or not they want to keep the note <e> <s> speaking as a scotsman i suppose that i ought to declare an interest and say that i am glad that they have said the same as the noble baroness has said <e> <s> however the fact also remains that the costs of the original note compared with the costs of a coin means that there will be savings to the taxpayer by adopting the coin instead of the note in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords in recognition of the special problems to which my noble friend refers the organisations for the elderly the handicapped and the blind were consulted as part of the consultation process before the coin was issued <e> <s> tests were carried out by nottingham university for the royal mint using blind and disabled people who through their organisations volunteered to help with these tests <e> <s> that is a fact and that shows that the decisions which were taken reflect their view <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that it was implicit in the earlier consultations that the coin would eventually replace the note <e> <s> i think that the noble lord is right i do not think that there were specific consultations after the decision had been taken to introduce the coin <e> <s> the fact is that three years or so was the time-scale envisaged and that is why the decision has now been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that if my noble friend has a problem he changes his coins into perhaps a note or even a larger denomination note <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of the day it boils down to a question of cost and the fact that the way in which notes are being used has changed considerably since the s <e> <s> i do not think that my noble friends suggestion would help <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord lord ennals i said that i do not believe there was consultation before the decision was taken to phase out the note <e> <s> the important point is that the consultations took place beforehand <e> <s> however i think that there is a balance to be made in all this and that is that the coin is not as totally unpopular as perhaps this particular exchange of views indicates <e> <s> there are those who find that the coin is a better means of exchange than the note <e> <s> in fact the circulation of the coin for this year has risen steadily as people are getting used to it <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of questions to be answered which were raised by those who have spoken and perhaps i may deal with them in turn <e> <s> the noble baroness lady jeger was concerned particularly with the treasury supplement perhaps i can elucidate a little on this <e> <s> in managing the national insurance fund which is not like a normal insurance fund as she and i might understand an insurance fund to be we try to achieve a broad balance between expenditure and income <e> <s> how the income should be split between contributions and general taxation is a matter to be looked at in the wider context of the burden of taxation generally <e> <s> in view of the other increasing costs of social security which are being met by the taxpayer we felt it right to make an adjustment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps in a minute i can respond more fully to that question <e> <s> i am sorry if i got the noble lord wrong <e> <s> he also asked why the treasury supplement has been reduced over the years to only half of what it was in <e> <s> the contribution by the taxpayer of which the treasury supplement forms part towards total social security expenditure has increased over the years <e> <s> although the supplement of the national insurance fund has lessened the proportion of social security expenditure that is paid directly from the consolidated fund has grown <e> <s> this elaborates upon the answer that i gave to the noble baroness <e> <s> lady jeger just now <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords comment <e> <s> i am sorry if i misunderstood him on that point <e> <s> i do not have an immediate answer to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of the remarks to which my noble friend has referred <e> <s> but i am sure that with his experience he will realise that cases which hit the headlines in the way that this one <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give those figures without notice <e> <s> the answers to the <e> <s> second part of the noble lords supplementary question were given in reply to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intend to be complacent at all <e> <s> there are real difficulties associated with some of the more marginal cases <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware of that <e> <s> i have not the figures he asked for but i shall let him know what they are <e> <s> so far as regional secure units are concerned i hope he will be pleased to hear that there has been continuing progress in the programme of regional secure units and the present position is that seven permanent regional secure units are now open which will eventually provide a total of places of which about are now staffed and available <e> <s> nearly places are expected to be completed by the end of or early and by the end of <e> <s> there are additional places in interim secure facilities and i shall be delighted to let the noble lord have those figures too <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly hope that the implementation of sections and of the act which has recently been introduced will help to provide an alternative to remands in prison in cases where there is reason to believe that the person concerned may benefit from hospital treatment <e> <s> but meanwhile both remand prisoners and sentenced prisoners may be transferred to hospital by the direction of my right honourable friend the home secretary under sections and respectively of the act <e> <s> the success rate for recommendations from the prisons for the use of these powers is now very high and we hope that this improvement will be continued <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly agree that it places a burden <e> <s> i have described the situation and the way in which the other sections of the act are now coming into force and as i said to the noble lord <e> <s> lord avebury those matters will assist the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot off the top of my head give the answer to the noble lords question about section <e> <s> again i shall find out and let him know the number of instances <e> <s> so far as the mental health act commission is concerned they have a wide remit and it is proper that they should look at this sort of thing and that is what my noble friend lord colville and his commission will no doubt be considering <e>", "<cs> my lords my departments officials already have had discussions with senior officers of the national health service authorities consultants senior nursing staff from individual hospitals directors of social services and prison medical officers about the problem of what are known as difficult to place patients who in a sense fall between two stools <e> <s> this has been taking place generally and ways of making required facilities available are being discussed <e> <s> in this context they have been discussing among other things the position of the courts in making hospital orders <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm both of those points to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend <e> <s> as my right honourable friend the prime minister said when reporting in another place on the fontainebleau summit the agreement is a successful culmination of the governments <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the last part of the noble lords question goes rather wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> however so far as our net contribution to the community in the future is concerned and this is the important point and the point which has been brought out by my noble friends question the fact is that our net payments in future years will be around half what they might have been had there been no agreement reached at fontainebleau there would have been no further refunds and no abatements <e> <s> the noble lord might like to know that more detailed information on our net payments in future years will be published in the next public expenditure white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is another question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i entirely share the noble baronesss views <e>", "<cs> yes my lords other members play an important part as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter will be closed in that sense because of course it is an ongoing concern <e> <s> but the fact that these arrangements have now been made will allow us to look at the restructuring of expenditure generally and over time <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that we are now able to get out rather more than we were previously <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the noble baroness and i entirely share the sentiments that she has expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the answer to that question is yes at fontainebleau <e> <s> i gave the details in my earlier answer to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on board and lodging payments under the supplementary benefit scheme which is now being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness and to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for their comments <e> <s> i shall endeavour to answer some of the points that they have made <e> <s> i think that the most important point to make at this juncture is that what we are dealing with here is basically an abuse of the system <e> <s> that is why it has been necessary for my right honourable friend to take the steps that he has <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept all that the noble lord lord stallard says by any stretch of the imagination <e> <s> the fact is that there are many examples of straight abuse <e> <s> there are examples even of families arranging for their teenagers to go to other families doing a sort of swap of teenagers so that they can claim the necessary charges <e> <s> that is one of the abuses that this announcement which my right honourable friend has made will bring to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why the freeze has had to be applied is because the amount of money that was being spent has risen from something like million to million in the last year or so <e> <s> we simply could not sustain that growth <e> <s> it was quite out of all proportion to the real need that the government and the taxpayer at large could be expected to meet from that sort of expenditure <e> <s> that is why it was necessary to do it <e> <s> however the noble lord will have a chance to debate it when the necessary orders are made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly aware that there has been some publicity about some strikers not paying their mortgages and using the money intended for mortgages for other purposes which i believe is what lies behind my noble friends question <e> <s> we are considering carefully whether steps should be taken to prevent it <e>", "<cs> my lords there certainly is evidence of various kinds that this sort of thing is going on <e> <s> a rough estimate suggests that about striking miners are getting such payments with average amounts of the order of and that some of those are going the wrong way <e>", "<cs> my lords i think with respect that that is a question that goes rather wider than that on the order paper <e>", "<cs> no my lords i think that that also is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right if people say openly that this is what is going on there can be no better evidence than that and that is why we have to consider very carefully what should be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the important thing is that we must assess all the evidence whether it be hearsay or more accurate and the sort of evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of tax rebates is one which again goes wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are certainly not looking for vindictive legislation <e> <s> the legislation which is used in all these instances is legislation which is looked at by the separate adjudicating authorities <e> <s> those authorities are required to look into the use of legislation in that way <e> <s> i entirely agree that the sooner the strike comes to an end the better <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> the fact is that there is an additional regulation regulation of the supplementary benefits claims and payments regulations which makes provision for mortgage interest to be paid direct to a building society or other mortgagor when a claimant falls into arrears if that is in the interests of the claimant and his family <e> <s> that is very much a matter for the mortgagee himself to take up <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think the noble lord may be right <e> <s> if i used the word hearsay perhaps that was the wrong word to use but my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier i am the first to support the idea that the strike should be brought to an end as soon as possible <e> <s> the noble lord has asked a question which again is wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords regulation no <e> <s> relates to arrears of mortgages <e> <s> i think that if over two months arrears are involved that particular regulation can be invoked <e> <s> if the question of paying mortgage payments direct to building societies needed to be invoked then it would require a change in the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> of course i think the building societies may be able to catch up with it after the strike is over <e> <s> that is very much a matter for them but my noble friend makes some very valid comments which i am sure my right honourable friend will note <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is relevant and anyway it is outside the scope of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come to that in a moment <e> <s> my noble friends also asked about who chose the design for the coin <e> <s> the royal mint advisory committee recommended designs to the master of the mint who is my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer who recommended the change to her majesty the queen <e> <s> the members of the committee were notable and they were headed by his royal highness the duke of edinburgh <e>", "<cs> my lords no i cannot elaborate on it any more than i have <e> <s> i said that the period will be indeterminate but will possibly be for longer than a year and the coin will circulate in parallel with the note <e> <s> i cannot be any more forthcoming than that <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the americans treat their dollar notes in rather a different way from the way we do <e> <s> if the noble lord will bear with me he will hear a little more from me on that subject in due course <e> <s> i referred to other countries and to the fact that like us <e> <s> these countries want to ensure that the taxpayer gets a better deal over time and that even if we spent more on the note it is unlikely that people would treat it any better <e> <s> i went on to say that it would not necessarily lead to the longer-lasting secure unit consistent with purchasing power that we all wish to see <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am saying is that they are not treating the notes in the same way as they did when the was worth rather more than it is now <e> <s> i can think of many examples of this <e> <s> the noble viscount lord hanworth referred to the way in <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall return to that point in a moment and pick it up with some of the points that were made by the noble lords who actually took part in the debate <e> <s> that would be very helpful to me and i have an answer for that particular point later <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point and i am sure that that is one of the aspects which my right honourable friend will note <e>", "<cs> my lords coming as i do from scotland i share some of my noble friends concern <e> <s> but the answer to his first question is no i am afraid not <e> <s> such a measure as he suggests would represent a radical departure from the long established policy of supporting the bank of englands supervisory role in the banking system <e> <s> the governments interest is in the effective management of the currency as a whole <e> <s> i do not think that any useful purpose would be served by allowing scottish banknotes to be issued south of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can give the noble baroness the answer that she wants on rounding now <e> <s> i am sorry that she was not able to take part is that particular exchange herself <e> <s> so far as consultation is concerned the main point i think is that the consultation took place before the coin was actually issued <e> <s> i cannot add more to what i have already said in reply to the questions raised on this issue because the consultations did take place before the coin was first issued <e> <s> there was as i say no consultation before the decision to withdraw the note was announced <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i agree with what the noble lord lord obrien says <e> <s> there is the added fact of what one might call an interest free loan to the exchequer through meeting the backing requirement that is necessary in the case of the scottish notes <e>", "<cs> my lords the cost relates to the returning of the notes to the bank because as we discussed the other day they get extremely tatty and require to be replaced <e> <s> that was the point that i made in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for the banks in scotland themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords in exchange for coin certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord says as i am sure does my noble friend also <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> they have produced a plastic note but that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i think that the facts speak otherwise <e> <s> the circulation of the coin has increased by per cent <e> <s> in the last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i should perhaps say first to those noble lords who have spoken that the regulations with which we are concerned today are part of a holding measure only <e> <s> this is i think worth <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course <e> <s> i shall do my best to find out and let the noble baroness know <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had another stimulating debate on this issue albeit perhaps rather shorter than the standard we set ourselves during the long hot summer <e> <s> those days when we last debated the issue of whether or not to allow unregistered retailers into the optical market to sell spectacles seem only yesterday but your lordships will recall the lengthy debates on the health and social security bill <e> <s> at that time i informed the house that under the enacted legislation we would prepare an order after having consulted with consumer optical medical commercial and other interests <e> <s> the sale of optical appliances order of council which is before your lordships today is the result of the balance we struck following all the views we received during that consultation process <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly come to it <e> <s> if the noble lord will bear with me for a moment i am in fact going to deal with tolerances and how that affects what he is concerned about in due course <e> <s> to sum up the point that i was really making to do with <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said these figures were reached by consultation that took place in the past <e> <s> if the noble lord wants us to go wider still i am sure that those involved will note his views <e> <s> beyond that i do not think that i can give him any undertaking this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to prolong this matter but the fact is that the position in which the general optical council finds itself is perhaps due to the way in which it has chosen to handle this particular situation <e> <s> i gather that it is to meet on th december to discuss the privy councils response and i hope that it finds itself able to reach a speedy decision <e> <s> but i do not think that i can go back on what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as recommendation of the greenfield report is concerned times have moved on since then as the noble lord will be aware <e> <s> our present proposals are the result of a study <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the second part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned i think that was made clear in what i said earlier that times change and move on and we have been conducting a thorough survey of what happens in this country and what happens abroad <e> <s> those facts must be taken into account <e> <s> concerning support for our proposals the noble lord will be aware that the list put out was a consultative one <e> <s> there have been many representations made about that list <e> <s> the chief medical officer in my department has written to all doctors and has received over letters which go into some detail on the sorts of medicines which ought to be included <e> <s> i should have thought that that was a perfectly sound way to approach the question <e>", "<cs> my lords ministers are not themselves experts on drugs and the noble lord will be aware that the members of the committee on the safety of medicines are the people who approve drugs the doctors the pharmacists and others and that will be the method which is held to in future <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> there has been much wild exaggeration which has preyed on the minds of many people who have no need to worry <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for his supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear that the right reverend prelate is so well and i can assure him that the points he makes are exactly the kind that will be borne in mind by those people such as the chief medical officer who will be drawing up this list <e>", "<cs> my lords we have asked the bma to comment <e> <s> it has refused to do so <e> <s> the ball is in its court <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that <e> <s> that again is the sort of point to be borne in mind by the experts who are looking at it at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand it but then i draw the attention of the noble lord to the remarks of my noble friend behind me who pointed out the letters that had been written in support of our proposals one of which is from the royal college of physicians <e>", "<cs> my lords the greenfield report was published in february <e> <s> we accepted its recommendation that a limited list should not then be introduced because there was not enough convincing evidence that the potential financial benefits would outweigh the administrative problems in drawing up and maintaining one <e> <s> since then as i have said we have done more work on the subject and we have learned from our experience and from the experience of others that savings are worthwhile <e> <s> a lot of what the noble lord has asked concerns matters which will be fully taken into account as the list is discussed and it is being discussed at the moment and i dare say that the list that was first issued will not be the same when it comes into effect on st april <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw my noble friends remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend and i am sure that the chief medical officer is also very well aware of the views which she expresses <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord suggests but a forum already exists and additionally the joint consultants committee meets quarterly with the department <e> <s> i think that essentially any change in the staff representation would be a matter on which the existing staff side should formulate coherent proposals for discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept the noble lords assertions which to some extent are scaremongering and unnecessary <e> <s> the important thing if the noble lord wishes to take this forward is for him and those whom he represents to have discussions through the existing machinery which will no doubt consider carefully what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that these matters are often best discussed locally <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> in any case that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords though month to month fluctuations are difficult to predict there are no grounds to expect at this stage that sterling m will be outside the target range for the target period as a whole <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is highly desirable and i am grateful to my noble friend for asking that supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has asked me a number of questions which i shall endeavour to answer <e> <s> so far as sterling m is concerned that relates as far as i am aware to all bank deposits <e> <s> i think that my noble friend will be aware that there are various other indicators which refer to different things <e> <s> the actual current period is a -month period as i understand it <e> <s> the actual limits for sterling m i am afraid i cannot find in my brief at this particular moment but i shall find them and let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> my lords thankfully it is a printing error <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware it was necessary to take the steps that we took for the reasons that were carefully explained by my noble friend the other day <e> <s> i do not think that i shall go further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord can rest assured that lower inflation depends upon maintaining a firm monetary control and that is what we propose to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that information <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend lord molson will note the figures that he gave <e>", "<cs> my lords subventions by the exchequer are calculated only for northern ireland <e> <s> however figures are available for identifiable public expenditure in all four territories <e> <s> the latest available are for the financial year <e> <s> the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords the calculation of public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the figures that i gave are the figures for the territories of england northern ireland scotland and wales and those are the only ones that are available <e>", "<cs> my lords there are special circumstances which relate to northern ireland of which the noble lord will be aware <e>", "<cs> my lords the subvention consists of five items the grant-in-aid of the united kingdom consolidated fund to the northern ireland fund the northern ireland office expenditure on law and order expenditure by the northern ireland courts service expenditure by the ministry of agriculture in northern ireland and contribution from the gb national insurance fund to top up its northern ireland counterpart <e> <s> three of these items the first the second last and the last are unique to northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords before answering the points which the noble lord raised i too should like to be associated with what he said about the late lord balogh and to express sympathy from where i stand for his family <e> <s> but in answer to the points that the noble lord raised yes we are aware of the research which has been carried out by professor fox but what the noble lord adduces from that is not really the case <e> <s> the researchers themselves say no more than that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in my earlier answer we do not accept that existing research has generally been conclusive as the noble lord himself seems to think it is <e> <s> we are already pursuing policies which provide the best way of reducing unemployment long-term <e> <s> equally the record quite clearly demonstrates the priority which the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already indicated that we firmly believe that what we are doing to remove the underlying causes of unemployment is the right way of tackling the problem <e> <s> there are various statistics which i could produce to the noble lord which would show that this country is doing better than many others <e> <s> the fact is that the soundness of the methodology being used in some of these surveys is also under some challenge by other researchers in this field <e> <s> that is the reason for the answer which i gave earlier to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but it was certainly not my intention or anybody elses to shoot down out of hand the research that has been done <e> <s> one pays tribute to those who carry out the research <e> <s> the noble baroness talks about commonsense in this respect <e> <s> it is commonsense also i suggest that in some individual cases unemployment does contribute to ill health through stress and through low income and in others ill health is itself a factor in job losses <e> <s> but generalising from particular cases has proved very difficult and i am sure that the noble baroness will realise that it is likely to remain so <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am sure that the noble lord is right in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that work and it is its methodology which has been challenged to some extent by other researchers in that field <e>", "<cs> my lords we monitor what is going on and i have said that if we are to produce any further surveys they must be of demonstrable usefulness <e>", "<cs> my lords for the third time i can say only that we are willing to consider bids for research on their merits but that there must be some point in carrying out the research <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can really comment on my noble friends second supplementary question <e> <s> however so far as the first is concerned we certainly actively support proposals to increase the allowance in question but as i have said it can be expected that fresh proposals which will include an increase in the other goods allowance will be put forward in the very near future <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that that question would be better directed to my noble friend lord kinnoull <e>", "<cs> my lords we are supported by other member states of the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point which the noble lord makes but it does not detract from what i said just now <e> <s> the fact is that if somebody has to be prescribed something for whatever reason whether he is getting a free prescription or one which has to be paid for in the way that prescriptions are paid <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point of the noble lady but the fact is that the taxpayer cannot afford to pay for every single item that is readily available over the counter of the local pharmacy <e> <s> the point i made earlier about people who really need medicines being treated in a way in which they will certainly get their medicines still holds good <e>", "<cs> my lords it was certainly not intended to be damaging or to relate to any particular patient <e> <s> but the fact is that there are many doctors who accept that a great many of these sleeping pills the benzodiazepines are given out too many patients forget them one cannot be specific about individual patients and they have been given them for too long <e> <s> it seems from what i hear that it is a very widespread practice which really ought to be stopped <e> <s> that is why we are setting about this particular proposal <e> <s> as the noble lord lord winstanley will realise we are just removing from this particular list certain drugs and leaving perfectly adequate drugs for people who need these items <e>", "<cs> my right honourable friend certainly studies all that transpires on this kind of issue in your lordships house and this particular debate will be no exception <e> <s> on the noble lords third point we certainly welcome all proposals for savings and hope that we may have constructive talks with all interests when this particular issue has come to a conclusion <e> <s> these talks will be additional to the limited list and not an alternative to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the list is under consultation at the moment <e> <s> it is much more important i think for doctors and experts to discuss it <e> <s> that is what we entrust the chief medical officer and his panel of experts to do <e> <s> they will complete it in due course and then the list will be published <e>", "<cs> my lords the present system may seem unjust to the noble lord <e> <s> in principle the relatives of general medical practitioners should be treated in the same way as unrelated ancillary staff but in practice it is not possible to do this without introducing what is despite the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord lord winstanley will note the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will explain how he proposes that that should be done <e>", "<cs> my lords the point about members of parliament is another question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but there are difficulties as the noble baroness will be aware <e> <s> we are always prepared to consider positive and realistic proposals on this issue from wherever they arise particularly where improved efficiency and better value for money are concerned <e> <s> nevertheless any negotiations relating to general medical practitioners including the reimbursement to doctors of the cost of employing their wives in their surgeries are currently conducted between the department and the general medical services committee of the bma as the representatives of the general medical practitioners interests <e> <s> that is the way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords primarily for the reasons of abuse of public money the risk of which would be unacceptably high in the way i described to the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> the extra cost of allowing per cent <e> <s> salary reimbursement even for related ancillary staff would probably come to many millions of pounds a year and that money would be better spent in other areas of the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case as far as i am aware she would not be ancillary staff related to the doctor for whom she was working so she would be covered elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not a course that i would advocate <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are currently considering their conclusions on the reviews <e> <s> proposals for change will be announced in the course of the next few months <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will be aware that particular review is not one of the main social security reviews <e> <s> however we have put in hand a major new survey on the prevalence of disablement covering the number of disabled people their circumstances and their needs <e> <s> it will be the first such survey for years <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend that it will start in july this year and will proceed through and the results from it should be published a year or two after that but i am afraid that i have no more information <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that the noble lord refers to the four main social security reviews <e> <s> the question of whether there will be a green paper a white paper or whatever will be decided and announced at an appropriate time <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the last part of the noble baronesss supplementary i would say that in evidence to the reviews many commentators have put forward ideas for longer-term solutions including some which involve the tax system to which the noble baroness referred <e> <s> the implications of these suggestions are all being considered <e> <s> in regard to the suggestion that it is just a cost-cutting exercise i would say no this is not so <e> <s> the government are conducting a much wider-reaching review <e> <s> we are concerned for example about the complexity of the system and how it might be made easier to understand and more efficient to administer <e> <s> we are concerned also to ensure that the best use is made of available resources so that help is channelled to the people who need it most <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord henderson for initiating this debate and for the constructive way in which he and indeed all those who have supported him have presented their case <e> <s> it is one which attracts a good deal of sympathy and support on all sides of your lordships house as the noble baroness lady masham said <e> <s> speaking for the government i can <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord hunter for initiating this debate <e> <s> many claims have been made by the pharmaceutical industry and others about the threat to its profits its investment its research and development and indeed its very existence as a result of the measures which the government have taken <e> <s> many of these claims not surprisingly have been repeated today and i welcome the opportunity to lay some of the more extravagant ones to rest <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that he disagrees <e> <s> i am afraid that i must disagree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords the consultation process on the limited list ended on st january <e> <s> as regards the pharmaceutical companies a letter was sent to the abpi on the day that the limited list proposals were announced <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made his point and i ask him to let me continue <e> <s> what has happened is that individual companies have made their own representations to the department and the experts concerned <e> <s> they have done it in very great numbers and at great length <e> <s> there is no truth in the suggestion that they have not been able to make their point <e> <s> as regards a review of the limited list a point made by the noble lord lord hunter perhaps i may say generally that we hope to announce the final details of the limited list very soon <e> <s> we will deal with the question of its review at that time as we will with outlying areas in scotland which is another point that was raised <e>", "<cs> will it go to france my lords which has a drugs reimbursement system which is much more restrictive than anything that we plan <e> <s> or will it go to italy where drug prices are very low and patent protection somewhat weak <e> <s> or is the investment to be cancelled altogether <e> <s> all the countries in europe and scandinavia are taking steps one way or another to reduce the cost of drugs which in this country have risen inexorably year on year <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware there are no countries which are not facing similar problems to our own <e> <s> i do not have specific figures with me for belgium holland or ireland but i can tell the noble lord that only a few weeks ago a senior official from the swedish department of health visited the dhss to see whether there were any lessons for sweden in our methods of seeking to keep drug costs down <e> <s> therefore i say again where is this investment to go <e>", "<cs> my lords there are considerable over-the-counter sales of medicines already <e> <s> i can see no reason to suppose that it is necessarily a bad thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their comments and to the noble lord lord ennals for his promotion of me which i do not feel that i deserve <e>", "<cs> may i cover some of the points that have been raised <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure that i gave is roughly equally divisible between hospital doctors and gps <e> <s> they have had the same time as everybody else which is three months in which to comment on what the limited list contains <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the important point to bear in mind is that per cent <e> <s> of all prescriptions which are issued are already free and of this particular group per cent <e> <s> are free <e> <s> so far as children the young the elderly those on low incomes and those who require certain special medicines are concerned they come into that percentage which i have just given the noble lord <e> <s> so far as particular drugs for children are concerned certainly two of the more regularly used ones that is to say calpol paediatric syrup and panadol elixir are on the new list <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier the chief medical officers committee of experts have unanimously come to the conclusion quite clearly that all clinical needs will be met <e> <s> of course the relationship between a doctor and his patient is important <e> <s> but there is absolutely no evidence whatever to suppose that all clinical needs cannot be met by this limited range of drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what particular question the noble lord was asking <e> <s> if he is spelling out the importance of the bma in this issue which he seems to be perhaps he can tell me why the bma would not come and talk to my right honourable friend the secretary of state about it <e> <s> so far as its being a money saving device is concerned as i have stressed on several occasions from this dispatch box in the course of the last few weeks the whole reason why it was necessary to produce a list was that the drugs bill was running out of control <e> <s> it was becoming quite colossal <e> <s> it has risen year on year quite out of proportion <e> <s> it is a problem which has affected and faced or should have faced several governments for many years in the past <e> <s> the fact is that we now have to get to grips with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i too have asked for the views of certain gps as one is bound to do under these circumstances and i find that my views coincide precisely with my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of consultation i do not think that i can add to what i have already said <e> <s> the fact is that my right honourable friend announced a proposed limited list <e> <s> we were fully aware of course that the list would be amended in the light of consultations for which my right honourable friend asked <e> <s> there it is <e> <s> the bma refused to come and take part <e> <s> that is its fault not my right honourable friends <e>", "<cs> my lords along with his colleagues my right honourable friend will be considering the report to which the noble baroness refers <e> <s> i hope that education authorities will also consider whether they are acting as effectively as they could within available resources <e> <s> my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for employment has asked the health and safety commission to assess the implications of the low pay unit report on aspects of their responsibility also <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think the facts support the suggestion which the noble lord makes <e> <s> in fact i have the figures for the number of <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but there is no evidence to support what the noble lord says <e> <s> however i shall bear in mind his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords at present all authorities except the isles of scilly i gather have by-laws and most but not quite all follow the lines of a circular of which the noble baroness will be aware which was issued in <e> <s> regulations would mean all authorities coming into line with the standard requirements although most but not all are in line now <e> <s> there would be resource consequences for those whose present requirements are different <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the accident rate is concerned the health and safety executive have estimated from the information available to them that there were approximately accidents to children at work in legal employment in but some other accidents were reported to the health and safety executive incorrectly because the children were not at work when the accidents occurred <e> <s> so far as addenbrookes hospital is concerned i understand that in this case the local education authority have made inquiries into the allegations <e> <s> when office cleaning services that is to say the contractors read the report that they were employing children illegally they took immediate action <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly assure the noble and learned lord that there is no intention of a casual reaction by the government <e> <s> however as i have said most of the authorities concerned have already introduced their guidelines which were more or less the same as or were identical to those which were suggested in the act <e> <s> of course we are concerned about children being illegally employed <e> <s> we are well aware of the allegations made in the report to which the noble baroness referred <e> <s> it is always a matter of concern if laws to protect the welfare of children are not being properly observed <e> <s> however it is of course the duty of employers to obey the law and the primary responsibility for the welfare of children rests with their parents <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that one can put some quite encouraging interpretations upon what has been reported in the report <e> <s> nevertheless not everyone necessarily feels that the figures are correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will give full consideration to all comments received and to the views of the social security advisory committee in reaching final decisions <e> <s> we remain determined to check expenditure on board and lodging and to curb abuse <e> <s> regulations will be laid shortly <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> over representations from a wide variety of organisations were received <e> <s> many were critical of one or more aspects of the proposals <e> <s> the government are considering the reports that they received and also the ssacs report <e> <s> this will be published with the governments reply when draft regulations are laid before parliament in the next few weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot without notice comment specifically on attendance allowance <e> <s> i shall look up the details and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly we are conscious of many of the anxieties expressed about this and about homelessness generally in relation to the representations to the ssac <e> <s> we understand that genuine concern does exist <e> <s> however we do not accept that all those now in board and lodging would otherwise be homeless <e> <s> nevertheless they include some very vulnerable people and the government are anxious to protect them in particular young single people <e> <s> we shall take the needs of such people fully into account in considering the ssac report <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord uses the word panic but the figures were rising at a most alarming rate <e> <s> the annual spending for claimants in ordinary board and lodging rose from million in to million in and it is estimated to be million in <e> <s> one could not particularly with the amount of abuse that is going on allow that kind of expenditure to continue unchecked <e> <s> if it had done it would have affected other parts of social security <e> <s> that is why it was necessary to restrain it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception of the statement and for the fact that they find the measures which we propose to take generally acceptable <e> <s> i certainly agree with the noble lord lord ennals that there is something very wrong with those who wish to exploit people for financial gain in this particular way <e> <s> i would also agree with him that there are some very real social legal and ethical problems to be undertaken but we felt that it was right to tackle this immediate problem now and that is why we are doing it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of the involvement of my noble friend in this matter <e> <s> with regard to the last part of his supplementary question on the industrial workshops i do not have figures but i shall certainly do my best to find out and let my noble friend know <e> <s> i am aware from those hospitals i have seen in the epsom cluster which i think are those to which he refers that certainly they do a great deal of good <e> <s> what i have said does not really cover the whole story because the schemes are only part of health authorities programmes which are made up of schemes of million and more <e> <s> much refurbishment work and the development of community-based schemes has taken place and it continues to do so in projects falling below that figure as well <e> <s> so i can tell my noble friend that the picture is in fact encouraging <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason it is not possible to get all the figures for which the original question asked is really a matter of cost <e> <s> these things are done locally and to have collected all the costs would have been disproportionate to the value in this particular case <e> <s> with regard to care in the community the noble lord will be aware that the recent report of the social services select committee in another place broadly endorses the governments policy in this area <e> <s> with regard to rate capping i can tell the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes my lords in most cases where there is a plan to close a hospital the wards will remain empty until such time as the hospital concerned closes altogether <e> <s> when such hospitals close altogether which will happen over a period of years in many cases the hospitals will be sold and the proceeds will accrue to either the district or the region concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the health side of joint funding already does not form part of that which can be rate capped under the arrangements to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords the hospital is being completely redeveloped over a period of years <e> <s> i cannot state what will be the total number of patients accommodated when the hospital is complete <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but one has to look to other parts of the country where the policies which the government are pursuing in this area are proving to be successful <e> <s> those that want to make a success of it can make a success of it <e> <s> this has been shown and i can give the noble lord several examples <e>", "<cs> yes my lords certainly <e> <s> if my noble friend has any particular examples i shall be delighted to take them up <e> <s> it is essentially a matter for the authorities themselves to look into these particular problems <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend that it is not the case as so often appears from the media that great numbers of people are likely to be discharged from our mental illness hospitals <e> <s> the majority of those now in such hospitals need to remain there and there will not be any huge further reduction in patient numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly watch panorama i saw a trailer for it last night <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have told the noble lord on numerous occasions the views of the bma and of the confederation of health service employees are always taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their comments on the statement <e> <s> i cannot agree with the noble lord lord ennals in a great deal of what he says <e> <s> he says it is a deplorable statement and that these sorts of charges should be avoided at all costs <e> <s> the noble lord must realise i am sure he does if he really thinks about it that if one wants more resources for the health service then somehow or other they must be paid for <e> <s> if the noble lord wants to do many of the things that he challenges me about so regularly across the floor of the house then these must be paid for somewhere along the line <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for those remarks i agree entirely with him <e> <s> he and i can both see that the national health service is a pit into which one could pour the entire gnp and still not make everybody happy <e> <s> that is why some choices have to be made <e> <s> nevertheless the fact that the nhs has improved so greatly in the hands of this government over the last six years demonstrates our commitment to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wallace asked me for the average cost of a prescription <e> <s> i did repeat in the statement that it was <e> <s> therefore the figure of is not even half the total cost <e> <s> as regards the increase of charges being a penal charge on the long-term sick i should remind the noble lord of the pre-payment certificates which to some extent meet those charges <e> <s> those who require long-term medical care can arrange for those prepayment certificates which mean a considerable decrease in the amount that they would have to pay if they paid the full amount <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give my noble friend the figure for which she asks but i can tell her that the amount of money which comes from contributions by private patients in the case of beds will amount to million <e> <s> of course that is a great help to the national health service <e> <s> what the party opposite never tells us is what it would do if it had to replace that money <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may explain to the noble lordlord somers that there are some disorders for which specific substitution therapy is essential and those suffering from those disorders are totally exempt <e> <s> about six or so different disorders are involved <e> <s> however in answer to the noble lord lord wallace i was referring to the pre-payment certificates which last for either four months or months for which the charges will now be and respectively <e> <s> by purchasing these certificates those who require long-term medication may have what would otherwise be a much more expensive charge substantially reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am aware that doctors understand the particular circumstances surrounding any patient <e> <s> if i may say so that is a pretty obvious remark to make <e> <s> but the fact is that at the end of the day the doctors the nurses and everyone associated with the national health service and the good that it provides must be funded <e> <s> the noble lord says that he will impose a blanket charge on the taxpayer generally <e> <s> i am very interested to hear him make that particular remark and i shall note it with some care <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards expenditure yes the fpcs will be expected to monitor expenditure on the family practitioner services and also on their own administration <e> <s> the management responsibilities of fpcs will encompass personnel organisational and finance functions involving their own staff and administration <e> <s> fpcs will be expected to operate within such guidelines and administrative cash limits as are notified to them <e>", "<cs> my lords our belief is that it will help <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have the figures for costs in front of me but i shall let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords cash limiting family practitioner services was one of the options which binder hamlyn was asked to look at and until we have completed our studies of that report and the related issues no decisions will be taken on it <e> <s> so far as publishing the green paper is concerned the noble lord will be aware that it pulls together other strands apart from those contained in the binder hamlyn report <e> <s> the noble lord will have to wait and see <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as cost is concerned i am sorry i do not have the figures <e> <s> i shall of course let the noble lord know what they are <e> <s> to turn to the relationship with community health councils the existing arrangements will continue and community health councils will have the role that they have at present <e> <s> the importance of family practitioner committees generally should encompass district health authorities community health councils and all those associated with them <e>", "<cs> my lords we took the decision to change the status of fpcs and i think that the noble lord probably took part in the debates on the bill last summer which dealt with this because we saw an opportunity to increase the emphasis on primary health care within the nhs as a whole <e> <s> the arrangements that will exist from st april will mean that fpcs are directly accountable to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to put down a written question i shall give the figures in that form or alternatively i can put a letter in the library <e> <s> i can do whichever is suitable to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> precisely my lords <e> <s> that was why i was suggesting a suitable device for doing that which would be available for all to see <e> <s> if the noble lord has any other means that he would like me to use of course i shall do so <e> <s> however i think perhaps a written answer would be the best way although if he wishes me to pursue another avenue i shall certainly consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks a very wide question but it is the policy of the government to make the best use of the resources available in all the different parts of the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the noble lord finds that the system is working well <e> <s> if in this particular case that is considered to be the best way of dealing with the problem which has arisen i shall deal with it in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception of the answer which i have just repeated <e> <s> i agree with both noble lords that it is a disturbing and sad situation when things such as this come to light <e> <s> whether or not it is the tip of an iceberg is a worry which i understand the noble lord to have <e> <s> but in this case as he will be aware three women in oxfordshire have developed cervical cancer after doctors apparently did not tell them that their tests were positive <e> <s> one of the women has died and the other two are seriously ill <e> <s> there may be more to it than has been possible to ascertain over the last couple of days for obvious reasons <e> <s> it would not be proper for me to go into any more detail than i have given because not all the answers are known <e> <s> but i assure both noble lords that my right honourable friends the secretary of state and the minister of state for health are looking carefully at this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i did say that <e> <s> perhaps i can give the breakdown to the noble baroness <e> <s> the deaths in were three in the age group to in the age group to in the age group to and then the vast majority between the ages of and and in the over -group <e> <s> that is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i forgot to give the figure <e> <s> the figure of deaths has declined by per cent <e> <s> over years <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord opposite that cervical screening is the responsibility of the district health authority <e> <s> i do not see anything that is particularly unusual about that <e> <s> that is the way most of the system works <e>", "<cs> my lords it happens in every case within the health service <e> <s> it is up to the local health authorities to decide their priorities <e> <s> it would be wrong for ministers in the dhss to lay down from the centre what should apply right across the board <e> <s> it is the system that prevailed also when the noble lords party was in power so that i do not know quite what the noble lord was so concerned about <e> <s> it is a system which has prevailed for many years <e> <s> it is the only way to run it <e> <s> we could not run from here precisely a particular recall system in district health authority x somewhere in the north-west of england <e> <s> it would be quite improper that we should <e> <s> it is right that we should give them the resources and they should determine what their priorities are within the range of resources that are given to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness is making a very valuable point because of the or so deaths to which i have referred about per cent <e> <s> were of people who had not had tests <e> <s> the problem is one of getting the older women to go for recall <e> <s> it is one of attitudes really <e> <s> as i have said per cent <e> <s> of deaths are in the older age group so i think that what the noble baroness says may well be right <e> <s> we are funding the womens national cancer control campaign to publicise the need for screenings and i hope that that will have some effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly try to find out the breakdown of statistics of deaths between and or and or whatever the noble lord would like <e> <s> i hope that that might also meet the concern of the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not have the figures before me <e> <s> for reasons which i do not understand they have not been worked out in that way <e> <s> why precisely that should be so i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not mean to treat it in a frivolous way at all myself <e> <s> i merely gave the figures which happened to be broken down in the way that i indicated that was the way they were presented to me <e> <s> however i have here a table which shows deaths from malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri between the years and in all ages <e> <s> a breakdown of ages is given and i can tell the noble baroness that in the age group to the number of deaths in was for the age group to it was for the age group to for the age group to for the age group to and for the age group to the figure was <e> <s> i will certainly let the noble baroness and the noble lord lord ennals have a photocopy of that immediately after this statement has been completed <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly that is one possibility but i think that the best way to deal with it in view of the arrangements that now exist is for me to write to both the noble lords and a copy of my reply will be placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble countess may be right and perhaps that is a role which could be played by the womens organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that is a good idea <e> <s> whether or not they actually undertake it i personally do not know but i hope they would take note of what the noble lady has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the pneumoconiosis byssinosis and miscellaneous diseases benefit amendment scheme be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady jeger and to the noble lord lord davies of leek for their comments <e> <s> to answer the noble baronesss prime point and what she described as the rather brutal date it is not intended to be brutal in any way <e> <s> the fact is that we are not making this legislation retrospective <e> <s> there are huge difficulties in making legislation retrospective <e> <s> the noble baroness will be aware of the comments that are generally received in this house when we make legislation retrospective <e> <s> it is not something that people like <e>", "<cs> my lords the allowance as i understand it will he paid to the person who suffers from the disease not when he dies <e> <s> the fact is that the legislation cannot be made retrospective earlier than st april <e> <s> this is the normal practice in these cases <e> <s> i see no reason for making it different in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we look hack quite as far as the noble baroness would want because of the difficulties involved <e> <s> the noble baroness is right in saying that if someone dies before st april they will not have been able to claim because the allowance will not have come into effect until st april <e>", "<cs> my lords the disease aids has certainly attracted considerable media attention and has generated much public concern and even unnecessary hysteria as the noble lord lord richardson suggested when he spoke <e> <s> i therefore welcome this opportunity to explain some of the facts and to dispel some of the myths <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend lady cox for providing an opportunity to do this <e> <s> she is certainly an expert as is the case with so many other noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> indeed much of what i shall say tonight will be simply reinforcing many of my noble friends remarks and those of others of your lordships who have taken part <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that they are imported <e> <s> i am not per cent <e> <s> sure <e> <s> i can certainly look into it and let the noble lord know <e> <s> in any case they have to go through the same evaluation procedure which is the important point to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the first point made is that the people who donate blood in this country are on the whole responsible people and they are not going to want to put at risk those who might need blood at any time in the future <e> <s> there is not a test <e> <s> this is the point that i was trying to make <e> <s> i described the kits that may be available but until we have a reliable test to check whether or not the aids virus or the aids antibody is present in the blood we cannot really take it any further <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree that it is a very big problem <e> <s> but in advising people at blood transfusion centres we have to be very careful not to run the risk of some kind of panic-induced collapse in the supply of blood <e> <s> at the same time we have to balance that against the very real worries of those who might contract the disease through blood or blood products <e> <s> as i have said there is really no incentive on the part of anybody to part with his blood if he is from an at-risk group <e> <s> the leaflets have been made available they are going direct to donors and they are available at transfusion centres and i think that that is the best way of dealing with this particular problem <e> <s> i certainly agree with the noble baroness when she says that counselling is important <e> <s> at the same time one cannot be too inquisitive about peoples habits <e>", "<cs> my lords i was interested to hear the remarks of the noble lord <e> <s> i can say that in scotland they have decided to require a signed declaration that the person concerned is not in the at-risk groups <e> <s> but this is not directed solely or specifically at their sexual habits <e> <s> it is a very difficult area i think both the noble baroness and the noble lord lord rea understand that <e> <s> nevertheless we are <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis of current forecasts of inflation the figures in the public expenditure white paper published in january which the noble lord has quoted show that total nhs expenditure is planned to remain broadly level in economic cost terms in the year <e> <s> health authority expenditure is planned to increase by about per cent <e> <s> as i am sure the noble lord is aware in recognition of the growing number of elderly people <e> <s> there is a planned fall in expenditure on family practitioner services in economic cost terms but this is <e>", "<cs> my lords i can read the papers as well <e> <s> i have noted the remarks referred to <e> <s> i do not believe them any more than i think the noble lord should believe them <e> <s> the government record on the health service stands on its own <e> <s> i have quoted it many times from this dispatch box <e> <s> if the noble lord would like me to give the figures for the family practitioner services and other parts of the health service i shall willingly do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows that we are considering the green paper <e> <s> it will be published in due course <e> <s> i beseech him not to believe everything that he reads in the papers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i was personally convinced that they would not be true <e> <s> i was not sure whether my right honourable friend had said so because i have not caught up with all that he said yesterday <e> <s> we are dealing with the same matter later today <e> <s> i am delighted to hear it <e> <s> i was sure that it would be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated we estimate that the savings will be about million <e> <s> if it is the case that they do not match up to that figure then we shall have to consider the situation but i do not think there is any point in speculating now about what has not happened <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i believe that that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i did not hear the first part of the noble lords supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords it is already in the white paper <e> <s> i do not think it needs a greater guarantee than that <e>", "<cs> my lords the process of regional consultation with local authorities voluntary bodies and others to identify alternative resettlement arrangements is just beginning <e> <s> no resettlement units will be closed until the results of that process are known <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state has a statutory obligation to supply either the space in the form of resettlement units or the finance for doing it <e> <s> what is happening in this case is that the finance is being transferred to the voluntary agencies which are better able to supply what the noble lord so much wants to see <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to camberwell the joint department of the environment and dhss package agreed in which is known as the camberwell replacement scheme and which i know the noble lord lord avebury is familiar with is more than a replacement for the camberwell resettlement unit which currently accommodates about men <e> <s> it entails the provision of a london-wide basis of new bed spaces <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble baroness perhaps does not take into account in asking that question is that many of the old resettlement units were too big they were too old-fashioned they were in the wrong place and they had the wrong sort of staff running them <e> <s> i should have thought that the best way to spend the money that is available for that sort of thing is to put it to the good use of the voluntary agencies which are much better organised in this respect and are capable of providing the service which the noble baroness so badly wants <e>", "<cs> my lords they will not close until such time as the new arrangements have been made and that particular consultation process has been completed <e> <s> to turn to fazakerley i think that the position is that the unit required a great deal of capital works and it may for some reason be uninhabitable at present <e> <s> i am not sure of the particular circumstances of that unit but i shall certainly check up and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness asks me why we are going to close these places and at the same time she is suggesting that perhaps there is something wrong with them <e> <s> it is precisely for that reason that we are diverting the financial resources which up till now have gone to these units to the voluntary organisations in the hope that they will be more successful than the dhss units have been up till now <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the first part of the noble lords supplementary it is generally accepted and i think that if he asks about it he will find that this is the case by those who care for people without a settled way of life that the resettlement process is more likely to succeed in smaller informally run hostels or homes than in the larger institutions such as resettlement units <e> <s> that has been confirmed by the departments monitoring of those voluntary projects in receipt of funding under schedule to the supplementary benefits act <e> <s> the noble lord would do well to bear in mind that this process will take quite some time to complete <e> <s> so far as charges are concerned i can tell him that all the financial provisions which are made for dhss units will be made available to the voluntary ones in the future if they come about <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the timing of this particular debate this occasion is i think the fourth in as many months when noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord is speaking for his party <e> <s> it has stated that it has a long-standing policy repeated in its last manifesto and confirmed by the shadow spokesman in the other place as recently i believe as during last nights debate in which it talked about nationalisation of the pharmaceutical industry <e> <s> if that is the case and if the noble lord is supporting his party i assume that that is the basis on which he stands <e> <s> in any case i cannot for one moment see that the industry is clamouring to accept further cuts in profit levels <e> <s> another cut in their profit levels was advocated by the noble lord across the floor of the house only a few weeks ago <e> <s> undermining the industry therefore is not so far as we are concerned an option <e> <s> how much more damaging it would be i say to that industry to be brought into public ownership which his party seems to advocate <e>", "<cs> my lords let me explain again why we are introducing a selected list and what drugs are affected by it <e> <s> first there are those which could be broadly described as comfort medicines cough and cold remedies laxatives mild and moderate painkillers indigestion remedies vitamins and tonics <e> <s> some of these drugs are used to relieve the symptoms of chronic complaints or to offset the effects of other drugs in serious illness <e> <s> but in the main they are used for commonplace ailments which will get better of their own accord <e> <s> most can be bought over the counter at chemists <e> <s> many have the same effect as other cheaper drugs <e> <s> secondly there are the benzodiazepine tranquillisers and sedatives <e> <s> in recent years there has been a proliferation of drugs in this group <e> <s> again many of them have exactly the same clinical use but some of them cost much more than others <e> <s> some graphic examples were given by my noble friend lord molson a week or two ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give examples of doctors <e> <s> what i can tell the noble countess is that there are examples of drugs which are prescribed under the arrangements which i have described and <e>", "<cs> my lords the regulations allow for it and that is why we are making the changes that we are making <e>", "<cs> my lords the regulations provide that from st april general medical practitioners may not prescribe and community pharmacists and dispensing doctors may not dispense at national health service expense the products listed in schedule a to the regulations <e> <s> general medical practitioners will however be able to issue a non-nhs prescription to nhs patients for schedule a drugs to be used in the course of national health service treatment if their patients wish it <e> <s> they will not be able to charge a fee for such a prescription <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the items to which i referred in the regulations are the tip of an iceberg in some respects <e> <s> as far as i am aware and i certainly was not aware of it until i looked into it myself these particular items could be dispensed under the arrangements which i described earlier <e> <s> all these things have been prescribed by doctors <e> <s> they have been prescribed very recently by doctors <e> <s> i find it a very strange way of practising medicine and i honestly believe that the average taxpayer would too <e> <s> it would be not only the pharmaceutical industry that we had to contend with if the prescribing of such common or garden items <e>", "<cs> my lords we have the prescriptions and i dare say that if necessary i could get them and show them to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i will just say that we do encourage generic prescribing it is generic substitution that we have not been able to adopt <e> <s> the noble lord knows the arguments for that <e> <s> we have consistently recommended that doctors should adopt generic prescribing <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that we have covered a lot of ground in this debate in which many expert and eminent members of your lordships house have taken part <e> <s> i am grateful for the many helpful remarks which have been made on this side of the house which have led to a balanced discussion <e> <s> perhaps i may try to answer some of the points which have been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the bma did not accept the recommendations in the totality which came out of the greenfield report whatever the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords without referring to all the notes that i have before me i could not possibly find out which point that was <e> <s> but i will certainly look at it and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can tell my noble friend that we understand that the chief chiropodists of district health authorities and all members of their staff are actively involved in disseminating information to school children by taking part in career talks <e> <s> i hope that that will help to achieve what my noble friend wants <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is partly right but there are no proposals to restrict the practice of chiropody generally to state registered practitioners <e> <s> we are considering advice from officials based on discussions which they had last year with bodies representative of all the professions supplementary to medicine including both registered and unregistered chiropodists on the question of the protection of title <e> <s> however i cannot anticipate the outcome of that consideration <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that there are no government proposals to impose restrictions on the practice of any of the professions concerned which would have the effect of depriving anyone of his livelihood <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am not in a position to comment on grants for training as such but i shall certainly find out about them and let the noble baroness know <e> <s> however so far as the question of possible increases in pay are concerned which is another factor which some people consider will encourage greater entry into the profession i can say that only state registered chiropodists are eligible to work in the national health service <e> <s> indeed <e> <s> i think that that comment adds to the answer which i gave to the noble lord lord wells-pestell <e> <s> on the figures approximately per cent <e> <s> of such chiropodists worked in the national health service on a whole-time or part-time contractual basis <e> <s> that represents a per cent <e> <s> increase over the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i note my noble friends remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords remarks and yes there is a shortage of chiropodists <e> <s> as i indicated to my noble friend lord gainford we are doing what we can to encourage recruitment to the profession <e> <s> a number of schools for chiropody have opened <e> <s> since four have opened at plymouth huddersfield belfast and sussex and that has led to a per cent <e> <s> increase in student output <e> <s> a fifth school will open later this year at northampton and there are plans to open another at southampton in <e> <s> i understand that plans for schools at preston and ipswich are being considered and that is quite encouraging <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords remarks but i do not think that i can necessarily go along with him on all that he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know off the top of my head whether or not anything can be done to restore it <e> <s> no doubt it was stopped for perfectly adequate reasons and i shall look into it and familiarise myself with all the arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly encouraged by all that the right reverend prelate said and i take note of it <e> <s> as one who has to do a certain amount of thinking on my feet i do not think that i can really comment further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have described to the noble lord lord wallace how we are taking steps to increase the number of places available <e> <s> however the fact remains that at the end of the day the number of chiropodists employed and the ways in which they are employed is primarily a matter for individual health authorities to determine in the light of local needs and available resources and that i am sure the noble lord will understand <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case as i said earlier that only state registered chiropodists may operate within health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the comments of both the noble baroness and the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> i shall try to answer some of the many questions that they asked <e> <s> perhaps i may start with the question of the noble baroness about why it has taken us beyond february to do it <e> <s> the answer is because we allowed longer for the social security advisory committee to prepare their report <e> <s> i should have thought that that was in the interests of everybody concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i am very grateful to my noble friend for that intervention <e> <s> what he says is absolutely true <e> <s> the numbers of people claiming for ordinary board and lodging have risen by the most staggering amount <e> <s> the figures i have here show that they rose from in to in and the annual spending based on this rose in the same years from million to million and stands currently at about million <e> <s> furthermore there is absolutely no sign at all that they were going to do anything but continue to rise at that kind of rate <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it and if i am wrong i apologise in advance they are subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall do my best myself not to get in a muddle <e> <s> i understand my noble friends point of view <e> <s> i shall find out about that matter and let her know <e> <s> the debate is of course a matter for the usual channels but i can tell her that i fully expect we shall debate these orders before easter <e> <s> standing up once more gives me the opportunity to answer the point the noble lord lord kilmarnock raised about halfway houses <e> <s> as i understand it this particular concern is met by my right honourable friends discretion in this matter <e> <s> that discretion covers the particular houses the noble lord is concerned about <e>", "<cs> my lords i may have been at cross-purposes with the noble lord for which i apologise <e> <s> i hope that i made it plain when i repeated the statement that those who are over pension age and those are the people i think the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it it is reviewed <e> <s> i am sorry that i cannot be too sure now <e> <s> i shall have to seek advice before giving a categorical answer to the noble lord <e> <s> in this case perhaps he will accept that i shall write to him rather than give him wrong information and mislead him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that perhaps my noble friend may be referring to the registration of voluntary and privately-run residential care homes and the improvements which are required under the registered homes act <e> <s> i can certainly let my noble friend have a copy of all that is contained in those particular improvements <e> <s> i do not have with me the details about medical care but i am quite sure the residents are looked after <e> <s> i can certainly let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so but the fact is that there are three main arguments for not increasing the allowance <e> <s> one is that there is some evidence of abuse of which my noble friend may or may not be aware the second is that an increase would discriminate even further against those employees who have no works canteen and who receive no vouchers and the third is that our aim is to reduce the rate of taxation for everybody <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the problems with this question which has cropped up on numerous occasions over the last few years is that it always relates to ham sandwiches which are not always strictly relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords remarks but i note also that in when his party were in power they were asked a similar question and they did nothing about it either <e> <s> the concession was originally justified on the grounds that the provision of luncheon vouchers did no more than put employees who have no canteen facilities in the same position as workers who have a subsidised canteen <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are doing better than our predecessors <e> <s> the fact is that the situation on this particular issue has not changed since the noble lords party was in power <e>", "<cs> my lords they do not have to pay income tax on the first p and that is what i think this question relates to <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i have anything to add to what has been said or not said by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the continued existence of the cardiothoracic surgery unit at guys hospital has never been in doubt <e> <s> lewisham and north southwark health authority had been considering ways of reducing overspending including the possibility of temporary closure of the unit before a generous private donation made immediate measures of this kind unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the unit has not been closed as the noble lord is aware <e> <s> any suggestion that patients might be turned away and die is totally alarmist <e> <s> so far as funding is concerned this is primarily a matter for the district and regional health authorities to deal with <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> there are in fact four cardiac surgery units within the south-east thames region alone <e> <s> that is a fairly generous provision in comparison with other parts of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see the point in answering such a hypothetical question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my noble friend puts his finger on a number of important points <e> <s> the fact is that expenditure on the health service has risen considerably <e> <s> it is absolutely right that decisions on measures of this sort should be taken by the district and regional health authorities concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem at guys has to some extent arisen because of its success <e> <s> in fact it has substantially exceeded its annual quota for cardiac operations <e> <s> i think the most important thing that we can do in this case is to ensure that the workload and the resources will be matched in future years and that is what my right honourable friend the minister of health is arranging with the health authorities at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords they already come from other districts to that unit <e> <s> the fact that this takes place is something which the regional health authority should take account of in conjunction with the capacity of each unit when they set targets and priorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that this unit will not be closed <e> <s> we are grateful for the very generous donation which mr john james has made <e> <s> other units are matters for their own districts to look into <e> <s> the most important thing in this case is that first it will not be closed and there is no point in speculating what might have happened if it had had to be closed i dare say that was one of the options but there are others as well and that in future health authorities must match resources with what is to be put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords the last part of the noble lords supplementary question has nothing whatsoever to do with the question on the order paper <e> <s> all units concerned with heart work in london are successful <e> <s> the four cardiac surgery units i referred to in the south-east thames region are excellent in every respect and we have every confidence that if there were a problem in one the others could help <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in answer to an earlier supplementary question my right honourable friend the minister of health is in touch with the regional health authority <e> <s> it is a matter for them and the district to sort out <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i should get into a dispute now about mathematics <e> <s> i am very bad at doing calculations in my head but i note the remarks of the noble countess <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their acceptance of the statement and for their kind remarks about my new position <e> <s> i look forward to a long association with these particular matters that are new to me <e>", "<cs> my lords the terms of reference of the review are available and the noble lord will no <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the very sincerely held views of the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> the accounts which detail all the bbcs financial affairs are of course published and available for him <e> <s> in answer to his suggestion that it ought to be a wider review i would point out that the terms of reference of the committee clearly ask it to look at changes in bbc financing and their impact on the range and quality of existing services <e> <s> i am sure the review will spark off a wider public debate which will inevitably involve consideration of the nature of the bbcs activities and the rationale for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i note my noble friends views on the terms of reference <e> <s> they are of course available and he will want to study them <e> <s> one of the terms includes a range of options such as sponsorship <e> <s> i think it is best if the noble lord studies them <e> <s> the peat marwick and mitchell report was of course a report which the bbc commissioned <e> <s> it was a most useful document <e> <s> it helped to inform my right honourable friend in considering the licence fee application and indicated to the bbc which deserves <e>", "<cs> my lords the aim is to secure a thorough crisp and business-like study of a lot of very complex issues <e> <s> we therefore have in mind a total of perhaps seven members including the chairman who will have a wide range of experience and background <e> <s> i am sure they will take account of the noble lords particular concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable friend will note the noble lords concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords concern <e> <s> of course one of the reasons for holding a review is that the issues concerned are difficult <e> <s> i am sure that they will note that concern <e>", "<cs> my lords the terms of reference are quite clear and my noble friend can study them <e> <s> unless he has done so i do not think that i can usefully comment on his question <e> <s> on the cost of the present concessions i think that my noble friend makes a good point <e>", "<cs> my lords it is estimated that there are about million television licence evaders and that at the new fees this level of evasion would cost about million a year in lost revenues <e> <s> however we shall be examining whether the present ways of spreading the cost of the licence can be improved <e> <s> if practical improvements can be found they should have an effect on evasion <e> <s> however one of the real difficulties with this particular area is that we can only hope that we are almost down to a hard core of people who perpetually evade buying a licence <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not included in the terms of service but i believe i am right in saying that that is a matter for another department and not mine <e> <s> however if i am wrong i shall let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for taking some time to find my way round a different area <e> <s> however it will be open to the committee to consider whether there are ways open to the bbc to secure <e>", "<cs> i first thank my noble friend lady elles and others including the noble lord lord mishcon for their kind remarks about my new appointment <e> <s> i fear however that i shall not be able to satisfy them as much as they would like on this particular occasion <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord dissents from what was said in another place <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that he does not <e> <s> if i have misconstrued what was said i apologise but i should like to think that what was said was perfectly correct <e> <s> the point here is that we do not intend any slur on the work of british officials in the community institutions <e> <s> as i said they make a valued contribution to the success of the community and to our membership of it <e> <s> but the same is true of british citizens working in the community in the private sector perhaps even more so because officials are prevented by their contracts from promoting british interests while that is exactly what exporting companies and other british firms are in the community to do <e>", "<cs> i fully accept that amendments nos <e> <s> to are paving amendments for amendment no <e> <s> which is the substantive amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure which way my noble friend voted last time but i take it from what he said that he voted the wrong way <e> <s> however we are talking about people who are abroad and not about people who are coming back here as i understand it <e> <s> i do not know whether i am more muddled than my noble friend <e> <s> however i think he may be under a misapprehension <e>", "<cs> i note the remarks made by all those who have spoken on the question of extending the franchise to all british citizens throughout the world no matter how long they have been away <e> <s> this would be a much greater change i have to say than was proposed either by the home affairs committee of another place or by your lordships european committee which looked at the matter in the context of european parliament elections under the distinguished chairmanship of the noble baroness lady white who was here earlier <e>", "<cs> that is one of the difficulties when we in an unelected chamber are dealing with this issue <e> <s> the point is that this is a step in the right direction <e> <s> we do not see necessarily that there may not be some extension in the future as i tried to indicate <e> <s> i hope that this is some encouragement to my noble friend but i am afraid that i can go no further than i have done <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady elles has made it clear how she feels that for european elections only the bill should be amended to give the right to vote to all british citizens resident in the european community <e> <s> during the second reading debate my noble friend lady elles asked for an undertaking that even if this could not be achieved by this bill now before your lordships committee the government would consider the introduction of further legislation in time for the european elections <e>", "<cs> as i understand it that was not in fact the case <e> <s> i confess that i am not familiar with that particular argument but i shall certainly look into it <e> <s> however i understand that that was not the case <e> <s> i am saying that by no means do we rule out further legislation if no agreement is reached in time for the elections <e> <s> i am happy to give an undertaking that we shall consider it and i hope that that will meet some of the concerns of my noble friends lord bethell and lady elles <e> <s> however when the matter was discussed in another place there was no suggestion from any quarter that separate more generous arrangements should be introduced at this stage for european elections <e> <s> i notice that the noble lord lord mishcon agrees with me on that <e>", "<cs> i would certainly have to look at the point raised by the noble lord lord mishcon because i do not know the answer and i could not find it out immediately <e> <s> in answer to my noble friend lady elles i understand her concern but i really have to tell her that the effect of this amendment is already achieved by amendment no <e> <s> and therefore there is no need for this one to be moved <e> <s> her amendment is effectively redundant and its effect is achieved by the amendment that we dealt with earlier <e> <s> it would be quite wrong for me to accept something which is redundant in that way <e> <s> what i would suggest is that my noble friend should withdraw her amendment now and in the meantime one will be able to look more closely at the drafting <e> <s> if she insists it is up to her to come back on report <e> <s> but the effect of her amendment is already achieved so i am not quite sure what she would gain by thinking far ahead now to the point that it might be lost in another place at a later stage <e> <s> i would hope she would agree that this would be the best course to adopt <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord bethell has certainly touched upon a very fundamental point <e> <s> yes it is said that members of your lordships house do not have the right to vote <e> <s> it is true of course that your lordships do not have the right to vote at parliamentary elections but instead as we have heard from several who have spoken this evening your lordships have the very great privilege of sitting and voting in your lordships house often playing a part and producing results which later go back to another place for further consideration <e>", "<cs> my noble friend asked me a particular question about the white paper <e> <s> that white paper as i understand it had to do with reform of your lordships house <e> <s> i really honestly do not believe that this is an appropriate bill in any sense to embark upon the sort of discussion that we are having on this issue <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lord massereene and the noble lord <e> <s> lord mishcon in his wisdom and indeed my noble friend lord mottistone very much put the finger on the point that what is good for one might be good for the other and we should end up in a totally different situation lead us all to believe that what my noble friend is proposing tonight is not a matter that should be discussed in this bill <e> <s> i note the points he makes but my lords i think the sense of feeling of the committee is that others might agree with me on this point <e>", "<cs> it may be true to say that no feature of electoral law has given rise to greater misunderstanding than the right of an elector to be registered in respect of more than one constituency <e> <s> the speakers conference of recommended a ban on multiple registration all three of the major parties which gave evidence to the house of commons select committee in the conservative labour and liberal parties said they supported a ban the select committee backed them up and the government came under pressure in another place to do something about it <e> <s> yet neither the present government nor the previous labour government to which the speakers conference reported have been able to respond <e> <s> i shall endeavour first to set out the factual position and then to explain why it is impossible to prevent multiple registration without making fundamental changes in the electoral system and i believe those changes would be ones which your lordships house would not welcome <e>", "<cs> i said that i was trying to put the record straight because wild allegations had been made elsewhere <e> <s> i was not saying for a minute that the noble lord <e> <s> lord tordoff would suggest anything quite so wild <e>", "<cs> i can give the noble lord the reassurance he seeks <e> <s> at report stage in another place the government tabled a series of amendments which among other things had the effect of preventing postal ballot papers from being sent outside the united kingdom <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at clause clause and clause he will see that an elector or a proxy who applies to vote by post may do so only if the address to which his ballot paper is sent is in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> the bill entitles an elector to vote by post or proxy if in effect he cannot reasonably be expected to vote in person at the polling station <e> <s> this means that if an elector is registered for two constituencies he may legitimately apply to vote by post or proxy in the one even if he is perfectly capable of voting in person at the other <e>", "<cs> on examination i see the point which the noble lord makes <e> <s> i shall have to consult on this as there may be some good reason why the word is to be added <e> <s> if i find that the word can be left out i shall do that but i can offer no encouragement at the moment <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord i was consulting my colleagues on this point and did not hear what he said <e> <s> i wonder whether he would be so kind as to repeat it <e>", "<cs> that is exactly the point i was discussing <e> <s> i think the noble lord is right and i hope that satisfies the noble lord lord tordoff <e>", "<cs> the bill makes a major change in our absent voting arrangements by extending the right to vote by post or proxy to all those who in the words of the bill cannot reasonably be expected to vote in person at the polling station <e> <s> however in order to obtain an absent vote the elector has to satisfy the electoral registration officer that he is eligible <e> <s> we think it would be quite unfair to expect the registration officer to decide whether an application is in order on the basis of a simple statement perhaps uncorroborated by any evidence from the elector himself <e> <s> during the period of an election the registration officer has little time on his hands and he needs a way of deciding quickly whether or not to grant the application <e>", "<cs> i have to say that i agree very largely with what the noble lord lord mishcon said <e> <s> he made a lot of helpful remarks <e> <s> i fear that the noble lord lord tordoff is going to find me rather less sympathetic than he would wish <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale said it is not much more than two years since my noble friend lord elton rose to invite your lordships to agree with the commons in amendments to the mental health amendment bill which for the first time gave the right to vote to long-stay voluntary patients in mental illness and mental handicap hospitals <e> <s> neither i nor i think the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can start by saying that i am sure the noble lord will be aware that in august last year we consulted the political parties on the new penalties for offences under the bill including the offences created by clause <e> <s> we have a letter from the labour party telling us that it had no objections to raise <e> <s> i should hate to get into another discussion about exactly whom the noble lord was representing but i hope he will take that point <e> <s> none of the political parties in fact raised any objection to the new penalties and i am delighted to have this opportunity of explaining why they were right not to do so <e>", "<cs> i think that my honourable friend the minister in another place subsequently corrected what he had said <e> <s> apparently he corrected it the next day and that is why it is not in that particular copy of the <e>", "<cs> the government do not accept that the payment of a cash deposit which is returned in full after the election is wrong in principle as the noble lord lord tordoff suggests <e> <s> candidates at parliamentary elections benefit from substantial rights and privileges <e> <s> the right to free postage is worth about in an average-sized constituency <e> <s> political parties which put up candidates at a general election are given several hundred thousand pounds worth of broadcasting time though not all candidates benefit from these rights <e> <s> however they receive a guarantee of free publicity on radio tv and in the newspapers a free platform on which to air their views however little they may have to do with the election <e> <s> every inch of column space and every minute of broadcasting time which is devoted to these candidates is that much less for the candidates who are actually fighting the election <e> <s> in these circumstances the government do not think it unreasonable to ask a candidate who cannot even win per cent <e> <s> that is one in of the votes cast in the constituency to forfeit a deposit of <e> <s> we readily accept the criticism that our proposals will not prevent certain candidates from standing <e> <s> we acknowledge that some perhaps add colour in some respects but it has never been our intention to prevent anyone from standing for election <e> <s> all we are saying is that if the candidate cannot win enough of the taxpayers votes he should not be entitled to taxpayers money <e> <s> standing for election is or should be a serious business <e>", "<cs> my lords in practical terms that would be difficult <e> <s> there are over establishments that is to say prisons scattered throughout the country and over cases a year <e> <s> of course it is an administrative procedure and not a judicial one and the figures that i gave must be set against the numbers who are paroled and who do not commit offences <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think that the noble lord is right <e> <s> in answering my noble friends supplementary question that is precisely the point that i sought to make <e> <s> so far as his second supplementary question is concerned yes i think it is encouraging <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble and learned lord that in to take the most recent year for which we have figures of who were paroled did not commit an offence <e> <s> i think that that makes the noble and learned lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords it was only part of the answer which i gave <e> <s> the fact is that of course the parole board are constantly vigilant about the sort of cases that they have to deal with and they realise their responsibilities as much as any of us do <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i think that the noble lord is right <e> <s> the percentage of serious offences which have been committed and by serious i am thinking of violence robbery and sexual offences in was per cent <e> <s> and it has reduced provisionally to per cent <e> <s> in <e> <s> i think that that is the sort of figure that the noble lord is concerned about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for that question and of course i shall do as he asks <e> <s> they have a major responsiblity to bear and the noble lord is quite right when he says that it is the individuals who go wrong who always hit the headlines <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the home office and the staff officers to the regional police commanders regularly review the content of police civil defence training courses and the advice in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord need not feel alarmed or despondent these are prudent measures to take <e>", "<cs> my lords there is of course the home service force but i think the noble lords question goes wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy of deterrence aims to prevent any attack of the kind which the noble lord envisages happening in any case <e> <s> that is the policy upon which we rest <e>", "<cs> my lords the united states calculations applied to rather different criteria <e> <s> they applied to an unwarned population mostly located in houses of light construction <e> <s> the original home office figures applied to a warned population that is a significant difference in united kingdom houses of heavier construction <e> <s> so far as the review of blast damage and the effects of blast is concerned it is a substantial review it necessarily takes a long time to complete <e>", "<cs> my lords the circular will come out shortly <e> <s> so far as figures for casualties are concerned the noble lord will be aware and i am sure that many other noble lords will support the fact that many millions will survive any nuclear attack and our policy is designed to prevent that kind of attack or any other happening <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are satisfied that her majestys customs and excise and the police are taking all possible steps to reduce illicit supplies of the drug to a minimum <e> <s> the available statistics and other reports suggest that the misuse of lsd is less widespread than it was in the early s <e> <s> however there has been some increase in the last four or five years and the government will be keeping a close watch on the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the noble baroness that one should not lose sight of other drugs although as she indicates cocaine and heroin are perhaps the most serious <e> <s> lsd is already a very tightly controlled drug <e> <s> it is in class a of schedule to the misuse of drugs act <e> <s> traffickers can therefore be punished by a sentence of up to years imprisonment and this will be increased to life imprisonment in the bill being introduced with government support in another place <e> <s> i can assure the noble baroness that every step is taken to ensure that lsd does not become more of a menace <e>", "<cs> my lords although i am not aware of the particular case to which my noble friend refers and it sounds a tragic case i am aware that lsd can be induced and used in very small quantities and that that is one of the features of this particular drug <e> <s> as regards education i can tell my noble friend that an information leaflet is already produced by the department of health and social security which highlights the sort of effect that this drug has <e> <s> a general campaign of education and information is already being undertaken by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord that the advice leaflets came first and were issued in february <e> <s> it is proposed to advertise particularly as regards heroin using the television starting in mid-may <e> <s> these drug issues are very serious issues <e> <s> it is a <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment it appears mostly to come from within europe but there is some production of lsd in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord some figures on seizures <e> <s> the most recent figures we have are for when there were seizures and in there were seizures but the actual amount that was seized was less in than in <e> <s> i believe that this bears out the point made by my noble friend just now that it is very small quantities of this drug which are so dangerous <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether lsd specifically can be sniffed out and of course the question relates to lsd <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the figures <e> <s> it would be unrealistic to make the sort of assessment for which the noble lord asks <e> <s> as regards the noble lords point about lsd being a bridge it is very difficult to say that lsd is any more of a bridge than some other drugs in this particular case

<e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend i think that his question goes slightly wide of the question on the order paper which is particularly concerned with lsd and the measures to control it <e> <s> i take my noble friends point and the interest that he has in it and i shall certainly deal with it if i can in written form rather than now as i believe that it goes rather wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i think i can be fairly brief with the amendment proposed by my noble friend <e> <s> the minimum age both for voting and for standing as a candidate at parliamentary elections although we are not specifically dealing with them now and local elections was until

lord tordoff that in no sense was i trying to be patronising <e> <s> that was not at all the sense of what i was trying to say <e> <s> what i was merely trying to say was that at the age of one may be interested this was one of the points the noble lord raised but just by being interested one does not necessarily have the experience which is necessary to take part in an assembly of that kind <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond again to that argument <e> <s> i accept the noble lords point that it is for the electorate to decide or they can decide ultimately when it comes to an election whether or not they wish to vote for a person of any age <e> <s> of course i accept that argument <e> <s> i have listened to what the noble lord lord tordoff has said and i have listened to what my noble friend has said <e> <s> my noble friend quoted from remarks made by my right honourable friend the home secretary remarks of which i was not personally aware but which i should like to study <e>", "<cs> yes i shall certainly give my noble friend the undertaking that i shall look at it and then write to him about it <e> <s> perhaps if he studies what i have to say when i have been able to reflect upon the quotes that he has made that will satisfy him and he will then as he says be able to consider whether or not to bring this amendment forward at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i can perhaps most conveniently deal with this amendment by saying that community health councils could already be provided with free copies of the register under my right honourable friends existing powers <e> <s> to that extent the noble lords amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> however the general principle is for only those directly concerned with the electoral process to receive free copies the political parties

remarks of the noble lords lord mishcon and lord tordoff this amendment deals with a somewhat technical issue <e> <s> it might be convenient if i explain the background before going on to say why much as we sympathise with the noble lords amendment we do not think it is possible to amend the law in the way he would like <e>", "<cs> i note most carefully what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i think i said twice when i spoke before that it was a technical issue and one on which quite clearly i could not give any particular undertaking now <e> <s> what i can tell the noble lord is this i shall certainly read with great care the points that he made when he proposed his amendment and i shall consult with the experts concerned on whether or not there is any particular give <e> <s> i am afraid i suspect there is not but i would not like to prejudge the issue without having read most carefully the points he has raised and i hope that will satisfy him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is thinking of ground defence areas <e> <s> each base or <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly encouraged by my noble friends comments <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my earlier answer to the noble lord lord jenkins it depends upon the tactical needs of the base and its site <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to give me a copy of the letter i shall study it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be so but the noble lords question relates to in time of emergency <e>", "<cs> my lords in wartime it is clearly neither sensible nor practicable to defend military <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always thought including during my period in the military that security in these areas was important <e> <s> i certainly do not detract from that now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all three noble lords for their comments about the regulations and to the noble lord lord mishcon for his last remark <e> <s> i hope that i can cover most of the points he raised but if i cover them inadequately or upon reflection feel that i could cover them more fully i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course i shall look at it and i shall look at the noble lords remarks and perhaps write to him more fully explaining it in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords the civil defence general local authority functions regulations require local authorities to make plans for utilising existing structures and indeed natural features as shelters for the public <e> <s> the

been taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i suggest that the best way to meet the kind of concern which he often expresses is to rely on our policy of deterrence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that it is one of the many factors taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the existence of the committee to which the noble lord refers need preclude our setting up for example some experimental community radio stations <e> <s> i can certainly assure the noble lord that there is no question of the government setting up a whole network of community stations in the time scale of the peacock committee <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer my right honourable friend will be making a statement before long <e> <s> i do not believe that the existence of the peacock committee need inhibit us from setting up some experimental community radio stations in the meantime if we decide that that is a sensible approach <e> <s> the noble lord will have to await my right honourable friends comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point <e> <s> i cannot go any further at this moment other than to say that the experimental services need not necessarily affect the outcome of the further programme if my right honourable friend goes ahead with it <e> <s> the noble lord will have to await the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords that is just the kind of issue which i referred to in my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i will answer as far as i can at this stage but if the noble lord does so he would cut into other peoples time and it is a fairly strict time limit anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords conscious that this has been a wide debate and time is not exactly on my side i nevertheless join in thanking the noble baroness lady lockwood for giving us the opportunity to consider today the important questions of the role of women in economic and social affairs and in public life <e> <s> as she said women make up slightly more than half our population the contribution they do and could make to the life of the country is rightly a matter of the greatest importance to us all <e> <s> and it is perhaps particularly timely that your lordships should have an opportunity to consider these matters in the year which marks the end of the united nations decade for women and the tenth anniversary of the passage of the sex discrimination act as the noble baroness lady lockwood mentioned <e>", "<cs> not necessarily my lords <e> <s> the average periods of detention which i have given provide no indication of the time for which any individual life sentence prisoner is likely to be detained because of the wide variations in the periods served in custody from which the averages are calculated <e> <s> nor do they reflect the longest periods likely to be served by some of those given life sentences and who have not yet been released <e> <s> in considering the cases of life sentence prisoners my noble friend will be aware that the very greatest care is taken by all concerned not just by the home office but by the parole board and the prisons themselves and no such decision is taken lightly <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord that each case should be judged on its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be well aware of the procedures which are complex and would take me more than a minute or two to go into now <e> <s> the point was made by the noble lord lord mishcon that each case should be judged on its merits and the very greatest care is taken not only by the prisons concerned but by the parole board and of course by my right honourable friend when he considers these cases <e>", "<cs> my lords to that extent the last part of my noble friends comment is right <e> <s> but it is always a matter of the greatest concern to all when a life licensee commits a grave offence yet it must be borne in mind that the vast majority settle down in the community successfully <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises some interesting points but having listened to what he said i think that they go quite wide of the immediate question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not really a matter for me it is more a matter for the usual channels <e> <s> but i take the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> certainly not my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i indicated in committee the government accept that there are powerful arguments for making special arrangements for british citizens in the european community <e> <s> the background is and i think the noble lord will be aware of this that the home affairs select committee of another place recommended an extension of the franchise to all british citizens in the community who have previously resided in the united kingdom <e> <s> the main considerations for the select committee were that the demand for an extension of the franchise had come mainly from british citizens within the community and that common membership of the community gave british citizens in other member states a closer connection with the united kingdom than was shared by british citizens elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i shall accept my noble friends invitation to discuss again some parts of the first amendment except to say that when she reads the record she will note that my words were that another place should have a final say <e> <s> however relating to this particular amendment i must say that the government fully accept that if it is decided to give the vote to community officials then their spouses should also have the vote <e> <s> all i have to say now to my noble friend is this <e> <s> as she is aware the amendment now before your lordships does not have quite the effect that i believe she wants it to have <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think that i said that it had not cropped up before <e> <s> i shall have to seek advice on this and i am subject to correction but as i understand it as it has not been raised before it is probably better if i take it away and consider it <e> <s> i shall of course write to my noble friend and to my noble friend lady elles and put a copy of the letter in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall certainly copy correspondence to all those who have taken part <e>", "<cs> my lords when the matter of the amendment of my noble friend lord sudeley the second amendment which the noble lord lord tordoff suggested that we could take with his amendment was raised at the committee stage i undertook to write to my noble friend lord sudeley when i had had a chance to look into the points that he raised <e> <s> my noble friend quoted a speech indeed the noble lord lord tordoff mentioned it again tonight given by my right honourable friend the home secretary when he was minister of state with responsiblility for electoral matters in <e> <s> it is no secret that the government have in the past given careful and indeed sympathetic consideration to this issue on which a recommendation was made by the speakers conference of <e> <s> it is equally no secret that in all the circumstances it was decided not to proceed with a reduction in the minimum age and the government gave an answer to this effect in another place on th february <e> <s> the government detect absolutely no enthusiasm among the general public or from young people themselves for a reduction in the minimum age either for parliamentary or for local government candidates <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the bill has passed <e> <s> it is my noble friend lord newalls betting gaming and lotteries amendment bill <e>", "<cs> i think that it has just passed <e> <s> i cannot give the noble lord an exact date but it has passed and that is why it is necessary to effect this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount has raised points particularly concerning the ethnic minorities <e> <s> if i may i can respond briefly to what he says by saying rather less than i would have done had he moved his earlier amendment but nevertheless stressing to him that the government already make a great deal of effort to encourage local authorities to adopt and implement equal opportunities and practices with particular reference to ethnic minorities <e> <s> last year ministers in the home office and at the department of the environment jointly chaired a well-attended conference of local authorities precisely for that purpose <e> <s> in my own departments administration of section grants we have required local authorities <e>", "<cs> i listened with great care to my noble friend in moving his amendments <e> <s> i too share the concern of others who speak so keenly about the importance of education in london <e> <s> it is a pleasure for me at this stage on more or less my first appearance at the dispatch box this evening to be able largely to agree with what the noble baroness opposite has just said <e> <s> the new ilea will have many of the same powers and this was the point that she made and many of the same duties as local authorities and it would therefore be wholly inappropriate for elections to ilea to be conducted differently from those for local authorities in great britain which are held under the simple majority system <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord intervenes i should point out that i am under some constraints regarding time because today is thursday and the committee has to be up quite soon <e>", "<cs> perhaps if the noble lord listens to the rest of the arguments which i shall put forward he will be more convinced <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their comments about the statement and i too would like personally to be associated with the remarks which both noble lords have made <e> <s> all our hearts go out to the bereaved <e> <s> it does not take me to add to anything that has been said about how awful it all has been <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i imagine that it will <e> <s> however the point that i was trying to make was a fair one that it is for the local authorities to enforce when it comes to the granting of the particular licence if that is the right word to use under this legislation <e> <s> i am well aware of the difficulties and i deplore the fact that the doors were locked but i can understand why that practice to which i referred when i repeated the statement has arisen <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that it is because sadly people take risks which have been associated with a number of people who have tried to get into the ground <e> <s> it has been established therefore for right or wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords concern and that in his view it was wrong to combine the two inquiries <e> <s> but although emotionally one can separate the two in fact there are points about them which bear on one another <e> <s> the fact is that as the noble lord lord ross of marnock will be aware there has been some little discussion over the last few weeks about the very problem of crowd control at football grounds and how that could affect the safety of people who are in the grounds as well <e> <s> in this particular case if one is able to imagine what it would have been like if the ground had been fenced i think the noble lord will see that there is a conflict which is probably best resolved by the terms of the inquiry which as i said will inquire with particular reference to those events into the operation of the safety of sports grounds act and recommend what if any further steps should be taken <e> <s> i think that it covers both sides <e> <s> that is why my right honourable friend has set it up in the way that it has been set up <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords concern and that he feels that without some sort of assistance this could spell the end of third and fourth division clubs <e> <s> as i said the further designation of these clubs that is to take place and the discussion that surrounds it must take into account the points that he made <e> <s> i have nothing to add to what i said earlier to the noble lord lord ross of marnock and to the noble lord lord wigoder on that count <e> <s> to ensure that this terrible tragedy is not repeated the important thing is to get the results as quickly as we possibly can from the technical inquiries that are going on <e> <s> that i sense is very much the mood of your lordships and i am grateful to my noble friend lord ingrow for his helpful comment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is simply not the case that attention has not been paid to these reports <e> <s> as i said a little earlier the phasing of the designation was <e>", "<cs> my lords i note my noble friends concern and the inquiry will refer to the operation of the safety of sports grounds act <e> <s> i am quite sure that in looking into the conduct of the inquiry mr justice popplewell will consider the sort of thing that my noble friend is concerned about <e> <s> there are special aspects of rugby football of which i can certainly let my noble friend have details in due course <e> <s> other considerations apply to some other forms of stadia <e> <s> racecourses and so on differ quite considerably from football grounds <e> <s> dog tracks for example are enclosed and would come within the scope of the safety of sports grounds act but not everything comes within its scope <e>", "<cs> my lords the important thing is for the inquiry to get under way and in the light of that to determine what further steps ought to be taken <e> <s> as i said when i repeated the statement my right honourable friend will report back to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords while noting the points that the noble lord lord hatch has made i have to say that i rather resent the fact that he suggested that i did not take seriously the comments of my noble friend lord onslow <e> <s> i most certainly do take them seriously and if the noble lord had had to deal with this matter in the way i have had to deal with it today he would not feel in the least that it was anything other than an extremely serious matter and anybody who feels otherwise would be quite wrong to do so <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord monkswell has described the effect of his amendment <e> <s> i think he has made a strong case for the closest possible relationship between local elected members and the police and i do not disagree with him <e> <s> it is after all the very purpose of this bill to pass to the metropolitan district councils as many as possible of the responsibilities currently held by the county councils <e> <s> however we have always recognised that there are some services of which the police is one which can be sensibly administered on abolition only on a countywide basis <e> <s> the white paper made clear that we are satisfied that the present general structure of police authorities is really working well and that it would not be appropriate now to consider breaking up existing police forces <e> <s> i stand by that judgment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord renton has a very proper and well-known interest in civil defence matters <e> <s> of course the government fully recognise that it is essential there should be proper and effective co-ordination of civil defence planning at the three levels he described that is nationally regionally and locally <e> <s> indeed we have already taken two important initiatives to ensure such co-ordination the development of a fully co-ordinated central plan embracing all government departments and the undertaking of a pilot study to explore the scope for improving regional co-ordination <e> <s> but much more remains to be done although i can assure your lordships that we are fully seized of the importance of co-ordination <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has made that point but perhaps i may anticipate what the noble lord lord mishcon might say if he were to move his amendments <e> <s> they are in fact not necessary <e> <s> as i understand it if the amendments of my noble friend lord renton are accepted they will be redundant <e> <s> i can only conclude by saying that i should be delighted to accept my noble friends amendments <e>", "<cs> having been in the fortunate position of accepting an amendment from my noble friend or for that matter from any other quarter of the committee the last thing i should want to do is to indicate any lack of civility to the noble lord opposite in relation to the intention of his amendments <e> <s> nevertheless i get the drift of what he said and i hope he will accept that his argument has been met by the government accepting my noble friends amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords remarks and i am glad that he found satisfaction in what i had to say when i gave the answer <e> <s> as he will be aware transfer to an open prison is a purely administrative matter which does not impart any commitment of release and in many cases life-sentence prisoners are transferred to an open prison not as a preparation for release in the way that the noble lord suggested but preparatory only to a review of their cases so that the local review committee and the parole board can be provided with an assessment of the prisoners response and reaction to freer <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree entirely with the noble lord <e> <s> the fact is that they were in open prisons for the reasons that i gave just now in answer to the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> yes they had all been convicted of very serious crimes and although i agree that it was perhaps unfortunate that it should happen in this particular way their removal from open conditions was in no way unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is quite right <e> <s> when my right honourable friend made the announcement in november he said and i quote part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords each case is always examined on its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem as i think the noble lord will be aware largely concerns brixton and the difficulties with staff there <e> <s> the fact is that we are exploring ways of improving the timetabling of production of cases of encouraging remands in the absence of the accused and of transferring cases to reduce multiple court appearances and all that should help <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper is strictly related to the production of <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the points which the noble lord makes but they are i think quite wide of the immediate question in front of us on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may be right in part about the escorting side <e> <s> yes there is some effect so far as that is concerned <e> <s> i think that i indicated in answer to an earlier supplementary question that the government were concerned about the remand situation and that they were taking steps to try to resolve it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that the figures have increased <e> <s> with the rise in the number of those untried the number of prisoners required to be produced has increased dramatically over the past few years which is the point the noble and learned lord is trying to make <e> <s> brixton for example now faces about five requests for productions every day and to fulfill this would require staff <e> <s> i think that that gives some indication of the sort of problems associated with escorting which was part of the question of the noble lord lord hutchinson <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as i am aware we do fulfil what is perfectly legitimate practice <e> <s> when we cannot provide people to escort remand prisoners we produce them at a later date <e> <s> i acknowledge the noble lords concern about it but it is not simply a question of redeploying staff of providing more staff or of implementing various other suggestions to mollify the situation <e> <s> but we do comply with the law <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may respond first to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and to the noble lord lord wigoder and thank them for their comments and for what i believe to be a general welcome for what is proposed in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give an answer in quite the terms that my noble friend asks but i shall certainly study his remarks and let him know <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i made clear when i repeated the statement and my right honourable friend made clear in making the statement that that was one of the most important features of the white paper and the proposals that might eventually stem from it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord somers is certainly entitled to his view on that <e> <s> i suspect that his remarks might quite well be addressed to those who organise the marches <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord somers expressed the view that marches do not achieve anything <e> <s> i was not attempting to make a judgment <e> <s> i am sure that a march does allow people to let off steam <e> <s> the point is that in doing so they should not necessarily trespass against other people and bring about all the other difficulties which might occur <e> <s> that is why the proposals in the white paper appear as they do <e>", "<cs> my lords i note my noble friends concern <e> <s> the fact is that the two new tests which the government propose and particularly the first of these that serious disruption to the local community should be one of the factors which the police ought to consider will no doubt to some extent take account of some of my noble friends worries <e> <s> this measure was proposed by the home affairs committee in another place and their report vividly describes the degree of disruption which can be caused <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> the points that i have described are just some of those which the home secretary has had to consider before deciding whether any action was called for on his part either by way of the royal prerogative or by the use of his power under the act of <e> <s> he may recommend the grant of a free pardon only where there are convincing grounds for thinking that a defendant has been wrongly convicted and that he was innocent of any crime <e> <s> having considered all the material assembled on behalf of mrs maguire and the others my right honourable and learned friend the home secretary concluded at the end of that there were no grounds on which he would be justified in making such a recommendation <e> <s> similarly he felt <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did ask three questions <e> <s> i am sorry that i did not answer them in my speech <e> <s> as i said so far as i know it is standard practice that tests are corroborated <e> <s> so far as the other two points are concerned i am afraid that i do not have the information with me but i shall find out and let the noble lord know the answers <e>", "<cs> my lords the school as i understand it is a <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no evidence to suggest that people from libya who should not be in this country are here <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> in accordance with section of the immigration act the immigration rules are laid before parliament <e> <s> there is thus opportunity for parliament to consider the justification for the rules <e>", "<cs> my lords the differences in the treatment of husbands and male fiancs compared with wives and fiances reflect the need to protect the domestic labour market <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord avebury will be aware that there are currently three cases before the european court of human rights <e> <s> the commissions report was an advisory report and the courts judgment which will be binding has not yet been received <e>", "<cs> my lords despite changing patterns in recent years men are still more likely than women to seek work and particularly full-time work at that <e> <s> the government have taken the view that at a time of high unemployment it would not be right to make the changes which the noble lord lord hatch of lusby is seeking <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a labour government who in found it necessary to reintroduce tests to prevent marriages of convenience for immigration purposes <e> <s> in we were elected with a mandate to strengthen those tests <e> <s> having tightened up the work permit system so as to prevent young men entering this country it would be absurd if we allowed exactly the same young men to come onto the labour market by using marriage as a device <e> <s> it works both ways <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely reject the noble lords assertion that the rules are in any way racially biased <e> <s> the immigration rules stipulate quite clearly that the control of immigration should be administered without regard to race colour or religion and any breach of this requirement would be dealt with by means of disciplinary procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord is suggesting that because the rules apply to men in this way they should apply also to women <e> <s> it has not been considered necessary up until now to apply the tests to foreign wives and fiances but we continue to monitor any evidence of abuse of the marriage rules by women to secure admission into this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that it would be better to wait for the judgment from the european court of human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> at the same time i shall if it is convenient for your lordships speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i move amendment no <e> <s> and i take it

dramatic <e>", "<cs> my lords treatment was certainly one of the aspects that my honourable friend discussed in america <e> <s> i think that there are some similarities between the way that we carry out treatment and the way that they carry out treatment there <e> <s> the lessons learnt by my honourable friend will of course be put to the group now considering the matter in conjunction with the minister in the health department <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their comments on the statement which i repeated <e> <s> i am tempted to start by dealing with some of the history of the issue which the noble lord lord avebury introduced but i think that the most important point i can make is that we were faced with exceptional circumstances and exceptional circumstances require exceptional measures <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon was quite right when he said that this is the first time that commonwealth citizens have been subject to a visa requirement <e> <s> but entry clearance has long been mandatory for commonwealth citizens wishing to come here for settlement and it has always been open to commonwealth citizens wishing to come here for temporary purposes to apply for entry clearance <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> if it is the case that representations are made to members of your lordships house or of another place in instances of this kind then a time limit of hours give or take is considered by those who deal with these matters to be appropriate <e> <s> as i said just now in answer to the noble lord lord avebury i understand that the machinery can cover weekends <e> <s> he referred to one particular case over this weekend but i do not have the details or that information with me <e> <s> but as i understand it yes it will be generally possible <e> <s> however i note the noble lords concern <e>", "<cs> my lords there are always people who fall between two stools <e> <s> i cannot comment on a particular case which the noble lord brings to me <e> <s> i am quite sure that if there were particular circumstances unusual to that group who were genuinely returning if they were as students from abroad that would be taken account of by the authorities <e> <s> what i cannot do is comment now on the case in any great detail <e>", "<cs> my lords the terms are set out quite clearly in the handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status <e> <s> yes it has to be determined but as i understand it they are not refugees within the terms of the convention <e> <s> furthermore the united nations high commissioner for refugees accepts that <e> <s> so the notification requirements of the convention do not apparently apply in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ennals asks why consultation as he addresses the issue did not take place <e> <s> we were faced with very substantial increases as i indicated <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord is aware of the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start by giving some indication of the figures to the noble lord because i did not give detailed figures before <e> <s> in the period commencing wednesday nd may there were arrivals <e> <s> on rd may the figure was on th may on th may and on the th may there were arrivals <e> <s> the next big increase was on wednesday th may <e> <s> between the st may and th may tamils arrived <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the auld committee pointed out that from the evidence it received the evening is regarded primarily as a time for routine food shopping <e> <s> some shops in some localities which stay open after oclock at night rely heavily upon their out-of-hours business for their survival <e> <s> i think that the main point really is that deregulation will not require shops to stay open they will do so only to meet demand <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the home secretary made quite clear recently in another place that he has agreed to look sympathetically at the best way of ensuring that established shop workers cannot be compelled to work on sundays following legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount will be aware that the auld report looked at this point in very great detail <e> <s> my right honourable friend has said that legislation will come forward in due course <e> <s> i think that it is best to leave it until then <e>", "<cs> my lords again i think that my noble friend is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am all for serenity on sunday and i find it perfectly possible to have a serene sunday and yet go to a shop <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord morris has explained why the bingo industry wants <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first congratulate my noble friend lady vickers on introducing this bill and on doing it so lucidly and with such feeling this afternoon <e> <s> it comes to us unamended as my noble friend has described happily revived from an untimely death in another place <e> <s> the area of sexual offences and prostitution is not an easy one to tackle as listening to this debate has certainly taught me but my noble friend has displayed a keen understanding of the problems which exist in this area and the delicacies surrounding them <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am trying to do in the last few paragraphs of my speech is describe the <e>", "<cs> my lords i said solicitation of a prostitute <e> <s> if i should have said something else i am sure that i will be able to correct it in a moment <e> <s> however i think i am right in saying that i should have said solicitation of a prostitute <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble marquess would like to listen to this it may make him more aware of the situation <e> <s> i shall quote the paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a little difficult for me to intervene when we are both on our feet together <e> <s> that is why i hesitate <e> <s> whether it applies particularly to public lavatories i am not entirely clear <e> <s> what i am trying to explain is that because the provision was being used in a way in which perhaps it was not originally intended the case indicated that it was following a different pattern from that which was intended earlier <e> <s> that is why it is necessary to have a fall-back position in clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i note the noble lords interpretation <e> <s> that is as it stands and follows the explanation which i gave <e>", "<cs> in that case my lords it is best i think that we move on and that i should take up the matter perhaps in another forum to make sure that we are all on the same lines <e> <s> i believe that the interpretation that i placed upon it is correct <e> <s> if it is wrong and that of the noble lord lord mishcon is correct we can sort it out in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> the noble marquess lord tweeddale raised a point about what he considered to be the sexist nature of the bill <e> <s> the criminal law revision committee took the view that the law already deals adequately with men who solicit men under section which we considered earlier <e> <s> that is the reason for the scope of clauses and being confined to men who solicit women <e> <s> therefore i do not think that the charge that it is sexist stands <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the name of the person if that is not out of order <e> <s> but certainly it came from hanworth road magistrates court and it emanated on th march addressed to my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary <e> <s> i can show the noble and learned lord the letter if it is of any help <e>", "<cs> my lords at least it is an argument which has been perfectly clearly expressed by those who wrote the letter <e> <s> the noble and learned lord quoted from other letters in regard to which i do not have the figures with me at the moment <e> <s> nevertheless if the noble and learned lord wishes to have the full text of the letter i can let him have it <e>", "<cs> my lords that point is one to which i shall return in a moment or two when i have completed my remarks on a slightly simpler point <e> <s> this was the question raised by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter initially concerning drafting <e> <s> as i understand it the use of the words principal effect at <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble and learned lord in moving this amendment was speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble and learned lord is moving only amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he did not move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has repeated in essence many of the arguments that he advocated earlier in connection with magistrates courts and coroners <e> <s> i do not think i need detain your lordships with a long explanation of why we cannot follow his proposals so i am afraid i shall have to disappoint the noble and learned lord yet again <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has described how these amendments would provide for the cost of probation committees to be shared between the authorities and their areas on the basis of rateable value instead of as the bill currently provides population <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has made clear his concern to ensure that there is fair distribution of costs between ratepayers <e> <s> we certainly share that aim <e> <s> but i must say that the proper way to achieve it is as we proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with care to what the noble lords lord banks and lord kilmarnock have said <e> <s> i think that the main point that i want to make is that this amendment is open to the same serious objections as that relating to the use of the single transferable vote which was rejected during the committee stage of the bill on th may <e> <s> no matter how much one argues that proportional representation is fairer than the simple majority system there is no escape from the fact that it enormously increases the chance of coalition government at national and local level <e> <s> whether or not i thought as the noble lord lord banks said that the term hung council was derogatory it is far more likely to produce weak and ineffective administration <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am not entirely clear what sort of discontinuity the noble lord expects <e> <s> we have said and i said just now again that we did not think it was right for ilea particularly because of the need to keep the elected representatives closely in contact with those whom they represent to introduce the sort of measure which the noble lord lord banks proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords one thing i am certainly not going to get drawn into is the suggestion made by the noble lord lord stoddart about a poll tax but before i say anything else about juries i can tell him that a person who is outside the united kingdom when summoned for jury service already has automatic exemption under the juries act <e> <s> so at least that answers one question which has been raised this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be <e>", "<cs> my lords i know it is true to some extent <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the position on the agreement but the party to which the noble lord belongs did take part in the discussions and i can say from the information i have that it was happy enough to drop its opposition to the bill as a whole when it was agreed to reduce the increase in the deposit to <e> <s> so it is certainly not true that it did not take part in the discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords feelings on the issue but i can stand by what i said that there was discussion <e> <s> i accept the point about whether or not the noble lords party was actually part of the agreement but the fact is that there were discussions which involved the noble lords party <e> <s> i note that he does not rise to refute that suggestion <e>", "<cs> yes my lords together with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> our proceedings on this bill have been dominated by one issue but before i turn to that perhaps i could remind your lordships of the other significant changes that it makes namely an extension of the franchise to perhaps half a million british citizens resident abroad a rethinking of postal and proxy voting including new arrangements for people who are away on holiday on polling day and an increase in the deposit required of a candidate at a parliamentary election together with a reduction of the threshold for forfeiture <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the kind remarks from all members of your lordships house who have spoken <e> <s> most of the work on this bill naturally reflects upon my noble friend lord elton but i shall pass on to my noble friend the remarks that have kindly been made by your lordships to me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady birk developed a theme that there was a <e>", "<cs> my lords although the noble baroness has not responded to my noble friend perhaps with the leave of the house i may comment on one or two of her remarks <e> <s> i entirely share her concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to say to the noble baroness that of course i agree that the services to which she refers are important <e> <s> she has talked about the standards which must be maintained particularly in the case of the fire service and i should be the first to agree with her that standards are extremely important <e> <s> i would also point out to her that my right honourable friend has said on many occasions that in no circumstances will the standards and availability of fire cover be reduced below minimum acceptable standards <e> <s> the chief inspector of fire services is a person who bears a very great responsibility here <e> <s> it is certainly one which i am quite sure everybody realises is of particular importance to dwellers in every area that we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not know how many times i can stand up and answer these particular points at this stage of the bill <e> <s> i think all i can say is that shall i study the noble baronesss remarks and her questions but so far as precept control is concerned they will mean a fair rate to cover the needs of service and the interests of the ratepayers concerned <e> <s> i can perhaps elaborate on this in another way to the noble baroness but i think that the offer perhaps of an amendment to clause is the way to approach it <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will not press her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that mr and mrs nicola are not refugees and they fall well outside the concession applied to displaced cypriots <e> <s> they have practised deception they have ignored our laws and have gone into hiding to evade enforcement action <e> <s> their case has been reviewed as i have said on numerous occasions by ministers of different governments and their appeals against deportation have been turned down by the independent appellate authorities <e> <s> there are no strong compassionate features <e> <s> mr and mrs nicola are comparatively <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is referring to the case of the people who came over here as a result of the cyprus war <e> <s> i think that is the point that he is trying to make <e> <s> the wholly exceptional treatment for citizens of cyprus as a result of the events there in applied only to those legally resident at the time when it was announced in <e> <s> it was made clear that that did not apply to those who had overstayed or otherwise disregarded the law <e> <s> as i have said mr and mrs nicola have been here unlawfully for over nine years <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting interpretation <e>", "<cs> my lords they are not refugees they are nationals of cyprus and can and should look to the greek cypriot authorities in southern cyprus from which they have no well-founded fear regarding protection from persecution <e> <s> in these circumstances they fall outside the provisions of the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees to which both the recognised governments of cyprus and the united kingdom are parties <e>", "<cs> my lords every case is looked at on its own merits <e> <s> the fact is that if in this case we were to do what the noble lord and others suggest it would be unfair to a great many other people who have been in a similar position but who have not deceived in the way that this couple have <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing to add to what i said earlier <e> <s> each case is looked at on its merits <e> <s> as i have said when they arrived these people deceived the immigration authorities <e> <s> they then disappeared and went into hiding <e> <s> the fact is that the european court judgment is not connected with this case <e> <s> the european parliament is free to discuss what it likes but we have to look at each case on its own merits <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can say anything other than repeat what i said earlier <e> <s> the fact is that the european parliament voted on this issue without even discussing it <e> <s> i think that your lordships might feel that is a rather strange way to proceed <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be helpful for the committee if i intervened on one point <e> <s> the noble lord referred to part of the criminal law revision committees report <e> <s> the part to which he referred that is to say paragraph on page is a working paper appended to the report <e> <s> if the noble lord refers to paragraph on page i think he will find that the recommendation is perfectly clear <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene so early <e> <s> i shall intervene after my noble friend has spoken but i may be able to clear up the mind of the noble lord lord wigoder and say that the single inclusion of the word persistently in this instance and this is the only amendment i am speaking to at the moment would be unhelpful <e> <s> first an offence would be committed only if a man solicited the same woman persistently <e> <s> so it does mean the same woman and i think that the noble lord lord kilbracken is correct in this case <e>", "<cs> perhaps this would he a convenient moment for me to give the governments view on the noble lords amendment and to take up some of the points that have been raised <e> <s> the issue of persistence was debated at some length in another place and it has given me my ministerial colleagues and the home office time to reflect carefully on the arguments that have been put forward for change to the clause <e> <s> but i have to start by saying that we remain persuaded that clause is right as it stands and i shall not try to explain why <e> <s> in doing so i shall elaborate a little on what my noble friend lady vickers has said <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for clarifying that <e> <s> i will come on to those points in a moment <e> <s> the broad point is the question of whether kerb-crawling is to be tackled at the root <e> <s> that is the basis that an act of solicitation of this nature is to be controlled by law that is what the whole thing is founded on and whether the police can be trusted to enforce the law <e> <s> in a moment i shall come to the three questions which the noble lord lord wigoder asked <e> <s> our intention is that the woman who has been approached will be encouraged to give evidence wherever possible obviously <e> <s> naturally many prostitutes will not wish to do so and some other women who have been mistaken for prostitutes may not wish to do so for a variety of reasons <e> <s> in such circumstances the police officer will have to decide whether the evidence he has of a single approach is <e>", "<cs> my lords yes and i can tell the noble lord on the question of private prosecutions i corresponded with him on this point and he is aware of it but i can repeat some of the arguments for the benefit of the committee that i appreciate that it would be of little comfort to the man proceeded against that he was acquitted by the court since by that time his reputation might have been ruined in the way the the noble lord suggests by the very fact that he has been charged with the offence <e>", "<cs> in that case i shall not go further into the question of private prosecution but i shall revert to the point the noble lord has made in a moment <e>", "<cs> the noble marquess is absolutely right <e> <s> we are not judging on the morals of the issue <e> <s> we are talking about the nuisance <e> <s> but the fact is that it is still a nuisance if somebody comes and does it once <e> <s> it is a harassment of the people who are not in the particular trade of which we are talking <e> <s> i do not think that what i have said is contrary to that <e> <s> i think that if the committee reflects on these disadvantages along with the need for clear evidence of an act of solicitation of a woman for the purposes of prostitution which will be needed to take forward any proceedings against a man for kerb crawling it may feel that the clrc tackled the problem in the right way and not only that but that we should support its strategy <e>", "<cs> i accept that we shall probably all have to read with great care what each of us has said <e> <s> we are dealing with several amendments at once and it is by no means simple as i am learning to my cost <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i have made it less clear but the fact is that clause clearly says that <e>", "<cs> the fact is that kerb crawling has become familiar jargon for this particular issue <e> <s> what we are trying to do is to put this whole matter into the context of what is now actually written on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> i do not want to spend very long on this amendment <e> <s> personally i share much of the noble lords concern about the inelegancy of the existing form of words but i have to tell the committee that the draftsman took exceptional care to try to find a way of not using the words which now appear in the clause <e> <s> the choice was not entered upon lightly as your lordships will realise <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene for a minute <e> <s> the noble lord is making a general remark about the bill <e> <s> i wonder whether he is going to address the particular point of this amendment in the interests of <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will see that the long title in line on page of the bill states <e>", "<cs> i take back immoral and instead insert monstrous <e> <s> i cannot really believe that it is as monstrous as the noble lord makes out for a vehicle such as this bill to be used for these purposes <e> <s> it seems perfectly reasonable <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord lord monson wishes to respond to the suggestion of the noble lord lord mishcon before my noble friend rises to speak <e>", "<cs> in that case i shall accept the noble lords invitation <e> <s> however as he is aware the bill is in the name of my noble friend and that is why i suggest that she may like to comment <e> <s> however i am very happy to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> i note the noble lords point but the fact is that this has been discussed in another place <e> <s> the whole bill drew considerable interest in another place as was discussed and made clear earlier <e> <s> as the noble lord lord houghton or the noble lord lord mishcon said it was revived from an untimely death and is now here <e> <s> there is no principal reason or matter of principle that indicates that a private members bill cannot be used to tack on some important recommendation or the enactment of some recommendation which has been made by a body as respected as the criminal law revision committee <e> <s> i cannot see that the noble lords argument has much force <e>", "<cs> i can respond only very briefly by saying that of course i accept the force of the noble lords arguments <e> <s> i shall certainly read what he has said with great care and draw it to the attention of others concerned <e>", "<cs> i note the noble lords concern about that matter i am sure there is a reason behind it <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot at this moment put m finger on the reason <e> <s> but i shall consider what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i think that might be the best way of approaching it <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies may i simply amplify what my noble friend has said because the noble lord lord kilbracken may not necessarily have in front of him the sexual offences act <e> <s> what section of the act says is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to both noble lords for their remarks and their kind references to the police <e> <s> i entirely share as i know does the whole house the views which they have expressed and i shall ensure that they are passed to the police <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter of the security of the palace of westminster is under continuing review <e>", "<cs> my lords the matters with which we are concerned here are primarily for the police in their pursuit of terrorists <e> <s> they are difficult and sensitive matters <e> <s> i am well aware of my noble friends interest in the all-hazards approach <e> <s> whether it is entirely appropriate in this instance i think is more a matter for the police to judge <e> <s> i think that in this case it is best left to the police <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for his comments <e>", "<cs> my lords what i can tell the noble lord is that the arrests followed receipt of information <e> <s> i cannot tell him whether the government of the republic were involved <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it they do not have the power to do so but whether they could call into question any particular sentence is hypothetical and depends on the application made in any case <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the concern of the noble and learned lord but we are signatories to the convention <e> <s> we are also leaders in human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the noble lord that we respect the court <e> <s> i agree with him that it is not perhaps an appropriate moment to discuss it in detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> again my lords i do not really think that i can go much further <e> <s> the question of the number of judges is not a matter for me but i note the concern of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many things that the court does which some would say were to the advantage of people <e> <s> i am not prepared to comment on any particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great care to the arguments put forward by the noble and learned lord lord denning but i am bound to say that while i have great respect for the views he has advocated i am not convinced by his arguments for insisting on the words sexual purposes in lieu of the purpose of prostitution <e> <s> i should like to expand a little on what my noble friend lady vickers has said <e> <s> to create offences under this bill which deals with all soliciting for sexual purposes whether or not there is an attempt to procure the services of a prostitute produces some very real difficulties <e> <s> i have looked carefully at the recommendations of the criminal law revision committee <e> <s> they say at paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords even at this moment i am trying to correlate with the page what i have as my speaking note and i shall come back in a moment to fill in the exact place for the noble lord <e> <s> there appears to be some lack of correlation and i apologise <e> <s> it will take a minute or two actually to read through the small print i am quoting from a bit i was given and i will come back in a minute <e>", "<cs> as i understand it a prostitute is not a prostitute unless money changes hands <e> <s> i am quoting off the top of my head and stand to be corrected but i believe that is right <e> <s> what i am trying to show here is that if we adopt what the noble and learned lord suggests a great many people who are not seeking prostitutes stand to be charged in the way i have just described <e> <s> the criminal law revision committee and the police are content that the safeguard that we have in the new clause as drafted which my noble friend hopes to move in due course will not hinder the proper enforcement of control and on that basis i think we should not lean further towards the prosecutors convenience <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may respond to some of the points which have been raised <e> <s> we have had an interesting debate and i am bound to say that i very much share the views expressed just now by the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> perhaps i may also refer to the remarks made by my noble friend lord mansfield and i should like <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying that the bill is trying to meet a particular need where there is in the words which the noble lord lord houghton does not like kerb crawling in the persistent way in <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but it takes two in this particular case <e> <s> the fact is that people driving round and round trying to pick up a woman whether or not she be a prostitute do on many occasions irritate quite understandably those who are not prostitutes but who happen to be walking up and down the pavement <e> <s> that is the menace with which we are trying to deal <e> <s> i hope that what i have said has convinced my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene but in moving her amendment i think my noble friend indicated that she meant to speak to the whole package in the way that the noble lord lord mishcon has <e> <s> i wonder whether the house will agree that my noble friend be allowed to make her speech now so that i can perhaps pick up some of the points later before the noble and learned lord lord denning speaks <e>", "<cs> my lords a great many different points have been brought out in this debate <e> <s> my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords what this form of words will do is oblige the witness to testify quite fairly and openly to what the circumstances were and whether in those circumstances there was a likelihood of annoyance <e> <s> this was the formula which the noble lord lord monson described <e> <s> i cannot see that the concern which the noble and learned lord lord silkin expresses is a particularly real one <e>", "<cs> my lords the formulation in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says oh but in point of fact taking account of all that was said and all that was said in committee has been carefully read if we were faced with the situation as it was then this was quite clearly a sensible way to take matters forward <e> <s> i wanted to bring out those points clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer it no more clearly than i attempted to answer it just now by saying that there were two strands to it that we have pulled together the arguments that were brought out in committee that annoyance is one method of dealing with it and that the persistence element is another <e>", "<cs> my lords i am drawing to the end of all that i can say <e> <s> i have expressed clearly my belief that we are dealing with matters of substance <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble and learned lord will allow me to continue because we are at report stage and he cannot interrupt too often without putting me out of order <e> <s> i hope he will allow me to develop my point and perhaps he can speak in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and i hope i follow the noble and learned lords arguments the whole essence of this bill is annoyance <e> <s> there was popular demand for it because many people were annoyed irritated and upset and this has been made even worse because of the extent to which kerb crawling has grown in certain parts of the country <e> <s> the words to which the noble lord refers at the end of subsection <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord but i cannot think of anything which is more of a sexual offence than rape <e>", "<cs> my lords at the committee stage the noble lord lord harris suggested that it should be me speaking on behalf of the home office who dealt with this matter and not my noble friend <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will understand if i take it because she again indicated just now this is really quite a wide matter <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby helped by his noble and learned friend lord silkin has taken it even wider <e> <s> those noble lords have talked about the whole subject of penal policy <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris extended it even further by drawing in the state of the prisons <e> <s> nobody could be more aware than i am with my responsibility for prisons of the difficulty associated with the huge numbers in prisons <e> <s> i think it would be a mistake to go any further into that now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in some difficulty on this matter because i believe that a day has been set aside through the usual channels for the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i cannot however remember off the top of my head when that day is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord the opposition chief whip <e> <s> this is a matter that will have to be discussed through the usual channels but i shall do my best to make sure that a meeting will take place early <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the experience and expertise of prison officers is useful in any transitional phase but my right honourable friends decision on thorp arch was a complex one <e> <s> it involved a number of establishments and various interests both parliamentary and local in addition to those of the staff <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that there are many factors to be taken into account with the rising prison population <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposals involve three prisons thorp arch hull and leeds <e> <s> it is a rather complex matter but i can certainly let the noble and learned lord know the actual movement of people in the case of all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords there are disadvantages in some cases in going through a period of consultation with the staff in complex areas <e> <s> i can give the noble lord examples of other prisons such as wetherby where we had to change plans at the last minute and this causes a great deal of disruption <e>", "<cs> my lords management in this kind of case is essentially a matter for the prison

able to have a drink outside the confines of the boxes on the terraces who will not be able to and they would be able to look through the window and see people in the boxes whom the noble lord lord dean described being able to drink and watch the game <e> <s> it is the element of unfairness <e> <s> that surely is the point <e>", "<cs> my lords being out of sight of the pitch is the key <e> <s> i can refer to the words a little later <e> <s> an element of unfairness creeps in if people can see into a box and see people drinking when they are unable to drink <e> <s> if it can be fully hidden

noble lord suggests <e> <s> anyhow my right honourable friend the home secretary has stressed the advantage of the initial dry period at the beginning of next season in enabling magistrates courts to

itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> if only to satisfy the noble lord lord monson may i deal briefly with the question of motor cars <e> <s> the extension of the clause in the manner in which the noble lord lord harris suggests in probing fashion would create considerable difficulties for the police in determining which vehicles were on their way to or from designated sporting events

little later and i hope then to be able to reassure the noble baroness <e> <s> if the noble baroness will bear with me until later i hope to give her just the type of reassurance which she seeks <e>

amendments nos <e> <s> and only relate to clause <e> <s> therefore it is in that spirit that i shall reply to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i certainly acknowledge the feelings which lie behind the views that have been expressed <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear expressed mild horror that this could in certain circumstances apply even to ascot <e> <s> she suggested that that was quite unthinkable <e>", "<cs> i cannot but what i am suggesting to the noble baroness is that we ought to be prepared to think about the unthinkable <e> <s> it is our job to anticipate these things <e> <s> the noble lord says that riots do not take place at cricket matches but there have certainly been examples i believe in australia <e> <s> i shudder to think that it might one day occur over here <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham can indicate that that is so far removed from us that it would not necessarily crop up here but i think the noble lord only has to consider the fact that my right honourable

i really cannot believe that no case has been made out <e> <s> because the problem has not arisen yet does not mean with all respect to her that the problem may not arise in time to come <e> <s> i

happening when one gets information that there may be a riot for example at a cricket match or even god forbid <e> <s> at ascot although i believe that to be a highly remote possibility if not even more unthinkable than the earlier examples i really cannot believe that the noble baroness herself would not agree that the matter should be nipped in the bud <e>", "<cs> i would be the last person to fail to give due acknowledgment to cricket <e> <s> cricket has been well served perhaps although he is not here today by the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool and i am sure that he would

parliament is in recess <e> <s> that is where the advantage lies and it can be debated during the days <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly draw the attention of all those concerned to the exchange but i must stand my ground a little on this <e> <s> the fact is that the negative procedure can take effect when parliament is not sitting to deal with an immediate problem because the order can be made and it can lie on the table and it can be debated during the following days <e> <s> one has not got time to recall parliament to deal with a particular problem which is forecast at a day or sos notice <e>

<e>", "<cs> i think we have the same powers <e> <s> i do not think the noble lord is right in what he has just said <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for his helpful comments <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord ross of marnock for his helpful and kind remarks <e>", "<cs> i have to say to my noble friend that before he made his speech on second reading and i saw his amendment on the marshalled list i was not quite sure what direction the thrust of his argument would take <e> <s> he said that this is a complex matter <e> <s> the definition of public service vehicle in the bill is the same as that in the scottish act and this will catch vehicles capable of carrying eight passengers or more if they are carried for hire or reward <e> <s> this will catch some mini-buses but it may not catch all mini-buses if they are not carrying passengers for hire or reward <e> <s> the government are aware of this but there would be real difficulty in extending the definition of public service vehicle more widely without catching private vehicles which would be contentious and would require careful thought as i tried to indicate earlier <e>", "<cs> of course i sympathise with the argument which my noble friend has put forward in moving his amendment that it would not be right for hirers their servants or their agents in the case of trains or operators hirers their servants or their agents in the case of coaches and minibuses to face absolute liability for the carriage of alcohol by their passengers <e> <s> but i have to tell him that his amendment is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i listened with interest to the point of the noble lord lord mishcon concerning glasses <e> <s> i believe he was talking about glasses which could be used for the consumption of the soup tea or whatever <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord dean has raised a difficult question that of whether drinking and the sale of drink should be permitted in private boxes and restaurants <e> <s> of course the government are <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to develop my theme i can point out precisely where in the bill he will find that it does not help <e> <s> the restrictions in the bill affect law-abiding spectators in the stands and on the terraces and they affect law-abiding spectators in private boxes also <e> <s> it is true that if spectators who were not allowed to drink could see other spectators drinking freely in private boxes it would be an annoyance for them <e> <s> i accept that and that it might reduce their respect for the law <e> <s> but even if they cannot see directly into the boxes in the way in which i think the noble lord lord wigoder was suggesting people have a pretty shrewd idea of what goes on there <e>", "<cs> suspect maybe <e> <s> they probably know because apart from anything else on purely practical grounds it is possible to see through one-way glass if the light happens to be in the right direction or if there is a light behind it <e> <s> they will know that drinking is going on and that it is smiled upon by the clubs and permitted by the law <e> <s> i do not see that one-way glass is the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt him but in that case can the noble lord explain the success of the legislation in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i did not wish to indicate a lack of sympathy for his arguments <e> <s> i said that the government came to their conclusions after a great deal of thought <e> <s> i also said that i would make sure that my honourable friend was aware of the arguments that had been put forward <e> <s> i said that in the light of the fact that he was already been in touch with two clubs albeit clubs that may be better off than some of those which the noble lord seeks to protect and that the home office has already been in touch with the football league <e> <s> what i also said and i draw the noble lords attention to it was that we would monitor the situation closely and that in the light of experience over this season my right honourable friend might consider whether or not it would be appropriate to bring forward amending legislation to relax the restrictions of this bill when we come to the new public order legislation in the next session <e> <s> that is what i have said <e> <s> i shall draw my right honourable friends attention to it <e> <s> i hope that with that assurance and there is no intention at all on my part to show lack of sympathy the noble lord will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to respond briefly to the noble lord lord hams <e> <s> i do not really think that in the short period of time between now and wednesday it will be practicable to produce the sort of consulatations that the noble lord seeks <e> <s> that would be one of the additional considerations that would face the suggested consultation with the football grounds that the noble lord has suggested <e> <s> it is better to consider what has been said today <e> <s> i shall draw my honourable friends attention to it <e> <s> i shall deal with the matter myself and in consultation with my honourable friend as quickly as i can <e> <s> if there is anything that i can do to help i shall let the noble lord know but i do not honestly believe that i can go as far as he wants this evening <e>", "<cs> i do not suggest that it would be impossible to meet the noble lord to discuss the matter <e> <s> i am concerned about whether the discussions that he wants would be particularly fruitful <e> <s> if the noble lord so wishes i shall certainly see what can be done about a meeting <e> <s> i still think however that it will be extremely difficult to meet the concern expressed by the noble lord lord dean and by the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> we are talking about real matters of principle in this part of the bill <e> <s> we are aware of the concern that has been expressed <e> <s> it has been deeply thought about and discussed by the government <e> <s> that <e>", "<cs> i shall try to be equally brief <e> <s> my noble friend rightly points out that trouble can often develop outside a football match <e> <s> that is the theme of the amendment <e> <s> the bill helps in one respect in that the prohibitions that it imposes in relation to coaches and football special trains reduce the likelihood of supporters arriving in the ground under the influence of alcohol <e> <s> there is also a power in the licensing act for the justices to order the closure of licensed premises on the application of the police in any area where the presence of supporters seems likely to give rise to unruly behaviour and disorder <e> <s> of course the police can deal with a person who is committing an offence under the existing law with a simple charge of drunkenness or something more serious in a public place outside the ground <e> <s> my noble friend invites us to go one stage further <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may develop the theme a little further <e> <s> the difficulty which i see is that because it is the vicinity or and it would include streets surrounding the ground as well as the area immediately beside the entrance a person for example returning from a supermarket with a bottle of wine in his shopping basket could arguably commit an offence if he stopped to chat to a friend in the street <e> <s> a person drinking a can of lemonade would equally be caught because it would be a controlled container <e>", "<cs> i thought that i had been able to make it clear to the noble lord i am sorry if i have not that under the amendments that we dealt with amendments nos <e> <s> and there are two strands to the argument <e> <s> one deals with containers intended to carry drink that is those which are caught <e> <s> the present clause catches containers of liquid whether or not the liquid is drink <e> <s> secondly the amendments limit the containers which are normally discarded such as cans or bottles or returned such as glasses and one or two other things as well <e> <s> hip flasks would not be caught because they are not normally returnable but they can cause injury if thrown but so can thermos flasks <e> <s> one cannot sensibly create new criminal offences on the basis that the police will not enforce them <e> <s> we have genuinely tried to meet a realistic need which was expressed among others by the noble baroness lady seear who said that somebody might legitimately take into a football ground a thermos flask full of tea or soup but would not be allowed to do so under the bill as it stands <e>", "<cs> i must confess to finding the noble lords position on this amendment rather curious and confusing <e> <s> he has soundly berated the government for allegedly trying to rush through what he suggested might be ill-considered legislation on the other hand he has tabled a number of amendments which considerably widen the ambit of the bill and create important new criminal offences criminal offences for which the noble lord himself has expressed great concern over the last week or two on other issues as well <e>", "<cs> that is right public order legislation <e> <s> certainly the government will keep under review the sort of happenings which entail people running on to pitches <e> <s> whether or not that particular matter will be included is a matter for consideration by the government <e> <s> i feel that there is something of a lack of logic in what the noble lord has put forward in this amendment <e> <s> i hope he will not feel it necessary to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is a complex part of the bill <e> <s> if i have understood the noble lords argument correctly his concern is that the provisions of the bill as it is at present drafted could mean in practice that if there were an unforeseen change of licensee for example where a dishonest licensee had to be summarily dismissed the football club could be faced with a period of at least days during which there would be a prohibition on the sale of alcohol and no power for the magistrates court to hear an application for a fresh exemption order no matter how meritorious that application might be <e> <s> so far as the sudden death of a licensee is concerned i believe that my own amendment amendment no <e> <s> has the effect of ensuring that clubs should be in no difficulty <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend in his curtailed speech that where a magistrates court has seen fit after careful consideration to grant an exemption order permitting the sale of drink the police should act to stop such sales only with good reason and with the appropriate level of authority <e>", "<cs> i am sure that in considering the way in which this legislation will operate general <e>", "<cs> i quite take the point that the noble lord makes <e> <s> it is difficult to put it on the face of the bill <e> <s> of course one must guard against overreaction and that is just the sort of thing which will be catered for by the instructions issued to police forces <e> <s> in general the wishes that have been expressed will be carried out <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly study the noble lords words without commitment <e> <s> i do not think i can do more than that because there are real practical difficulties to adopting my noble friends suggestion <e> <s> but i shall certainly consider it and i shall discuss it with my honourable friends <e> <s> i hope that that will meet his concern <e>", "<cs> my noble friends proposal would confer on the police additional powers of search beyond those already contained in the bill <e> <s> by clause the bill makes it an offence to be in possession of alcohol on a football special coach or train <e> <s> this offence attracts the power of search in clause which is exercisable on reasonable suspicion that the person is committing or has committed one of the offences in the bill <e> <s> since the offence of being in possession of alcohol on a coach or a train is capable of being committed only in the vehicle itself it follows that the power of search is capable of being exercised only in the vehicle itself or if there is reasonable suspicion that an offence has been committed when the suspected offender gets off the train <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris of greenwich will not expect me to rehearse the same arguments again <e> <s> i know his feelings on this matter <e> <s> we have already said that it may be possible to meet and to try to thrash something out before the next stage <e> <s> that is probably the best way to leave this matter <e> <s> with that i hope that the noble lord will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may have seen the panorama programme which indicated that there was a reduction <e> <s> that was not correct in all that it said <e> <s> one has to balance enjoyment with the need to introduce self-pride and self-discipline <e> <s> the regime which is now being pursued is effective <e> <s> we believe that it will continue to be so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think in my original answer i said that it was the separate drill sessions and the extra pe that were being curtailed <e> <s> i have details of the weekday routine for detention centres and i can assure the noble lord that a great deal of pe still takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord repeat the question <e>", "<cs> no my lords they are not <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think that the noble baroness has put her finger on an important point <e> <s> while many of these people already have children when they go to the centre they come from the sort of background which means that they would not normally have been taught the basic parentcraft which is necessary <e> <s> the noble baroness may care to know that the governor has had many letters supporting the activity that was shown <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord puts his finger on an important point <e> <s> it is important to try to provide the necessary resettlement for boys leaving these centres and i shall certainly look <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first question no i was not <e> <s> so far as the general principle of it is concerned i think that those who were being given that instruction were not necessarily being given quite the easy time that some people

matter for the other place than for your lordships house <e> <s> i have nothing more to say <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord tordoff will agree that it would be inappropriate to press his amendment further <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said it is rather more than two years since it fell to me to reply to the last debate that we had on the prospects for reform of the licensing law

perhaps i ought to be with where one can draw the line with the law of nuisance but i think that the relevance of licensing laws to the general problem of nuisance caused by people who frequent pubs and might do so late at night really does bear thinking about <e> <s> the noble viscount lord falkland referred particularly to the question of skittles with bottles being played late at night <e> <s> i think that what i have just said indicates that there are many others who might be affected by the sort of problem to which this might lead <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to be much more precise but i should hope that it will be some time in the autumn <e> <s> but equally i should hope that my noble friend will not tie me to that date <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the concern of the noble lord <e> <s> but this decision will of course have been taken at the highest level and i should expect the board of governors to have been fully consulted about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lord has the right date <e> <s> but what i can say is that the surest way of preventing the sort of horrors which the film depicts is by a policy of deterrence and i am not sure that if we had adopted the noble lords posture we should have had years or so since this film was made in the way that he would wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have answered the question <e> <s> i am not prepared to get into a discussion with the noble lord about somebody elses question which is the one to which he is referring <e>", "<cs> with respect my lords that is an entirely different question <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend might feel that but on the other hand it is a matter for the authorities who broadcast to decide for themselves what is right or wrong to broadcast at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help feeling that the chairman and the board of governors of the bbc and the iba note the sort of exchanges which take place in your lordships house of which my noble friends has been one <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought the important point to draw from nagasaki was the horror of where not adopting the sort of posture

interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly believe it is important that this matter should be looked into and that is what the widdicombe inquiry is doing <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that her majestys inspectors would see this sort of propaganda <e> <s> if they do so they would comment adversely on that fact in their reports <e> <s> the responsibility would then be on the education authority in this case the ilea to take corrective action <e> <s> the reports of her majestys inspectors are published and an authority would be very unwise to risk outraging public opinion further by failing to put its house in order <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be very nice to see and i hope that he will <e>", "<cs> my lords in discussing these amendments your lordships have shown an understandable concern about the financial effects on football clubs of the ban on drinking and the sale of drink in private boxes and restaurants from which the game may be directly viewed <e> <s> the noble lord lord dean of beswick expressed his concern forcefully in committee last thursday and he referred to other discussions which had taken place on it <e> <s> i rehearsed the governments view about this difficult issue very fully in committee the other day and i do not propose to cover all that ground and weary your lordships for too long today but some noble lords have expressed doubts as to whether the distinction drawn in the bill between areas with a direct view on to the pitch and areas without a direct view on to the pitch is a logical one <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully accept the noble lords argument that a hip flask if it is thrown could constitute a dangerous missile even though i still seriously wonder whether many hooligans are likely to <e>", "<cs> my lords on my print of the bill which is the bill as amended in committee if the noble lord lord mishcon looks at page line he will see the last two words a constable or at least half the word constable on that line <e> <s> i think he will find that it is there <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly appreciate my noble friends concern that the power in the bill to close bars during a match must be exercised with the utmost care <e> <s> i listened carefully to his remarks not only today but also at committee stage when he mentioned the difficulty about young police officers <e> <s> he was supported by others of your lordships in committee <e> <s> i have considered them carefully but i am afraid that i am not in the least persuaded that this power should be limited to officers of at least the rank of sergeant <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend would allow the question to be put <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend <e> <s> it was i believe my error <e> <s> i apologise for interrupting my noble friends flow <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards any policing within the football ground it would be the responsibility of the club to come to an arrangement with the police on the cost of providing that service <e> <s> as i understand it the dates of the games are arranged in advance and policing is therefore arranged in advance <e> <s> if extra police are required to meet a particular public order requirement i dare say that the arrangements which have been considered earlier may be modified but i would not necessarily suspect that in every case they would be modified <e> <s> as i understand it the cost will have been discussed beforehand with the police <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may explain that the need for the constable to enter is in order to enforce the provisions of the act <e> <s> the cost of normal policing arrangements within a club are agreed upon beforehand <e> <s> essentially as i understand it there would be no request the police would be entering the club to deal with an emergency <e> <s> i am sure that that meets the noble lords concern <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to ask the leave of the house to respond to the noble lord lord mishcon who asked whether i could elucidate a couple of points <e> <s> it is in that spirit that i now seek to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to speak i am simply trying to clear up in advance one or two points which the noble lord lord mishcon made <e> <s> i do not intend to confuse the house and if the house thinks that i ought not to intervene then i shall sit down and speak later <e> <s> however i should like to cover two matters <e> <s> one concerns invitations to attend which is the point made by the noble lord lord beswick <e> <s> because there is no invitation and the constable attends to deal with a particular emergency that does not raise a charge so there is no concern <e> <s> as regards variations in the way in which chief constables may deal with particular circumstances and the need for guidance all i can do is to note the remarks of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i honestly cannot give an undertaking on the matter now <e> <s> i do not believe that there need be the concern that the noble lord expresses but i am sure that it is a matter that all will bear in mind <e>", "<cs> i cannot but what i am suggesting to the noble baroness is that we ought to be prepared to think about the unthinkable <e> <s> it is our job to anticipate these things <e> <s> the noble lord i think he was referring to me at that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords many of the concerns which have been expressed this afternoon were deployed last week at committee stage <e> <s> my right honourable friend fully understands the concern expressed <e> <s> he has carefully considered all the arguments which have been put to us <e>", "<cs> my lords that takes me back to the day before yesterday and it is a subject upon which i do not propose to embark now <e> <s> as i have said and as your lordships will be aware our scottish colleagues have made only one very limited extension beyond soccer in that murrayfield is designated when rugby internationals are played there <e>", "<cs> my lords if anything that point strengthens the argument which i advocate <e> <s> so far as aeroplanes are concerned there is a perfectly sound precedent and measure which is internationally respected that the captains of aircraft have the right to prevent drink or drunken passengers coming on to the aircraft <e> <s> as i said the other day it is a power which i have exercised in a professional capacity myself <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord studies the remarks that i made to deal with the particular problem about bradford which is rather unusual and the circumstances will be known to the noble lord his concern will be met <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house as another scotsman perhaps i may merely say to the noble lord that i am sure that in that he is almost certainly correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i meant to refer to that <e> <s> i can tell him honestly that no bodies have been consulted other than football <e>", "<cs> my lords there are those who would have us attach a limited life to this bill at the outset <e> <s> that i fully understand <e> <s> various reasons have been adduced why we should do so that the bill is experimental that it confers undesirable wide-ranging powers on the secretary of state that it places restrictions on football clubs and spectators the need for which ought to be kept under review and that the bill has had to complete its parliamentary passage with unusual speed <e> <s> that was the thrust of the argument of the noble lord lord monson just now <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may respond without making another lengthy speech on this matter i should first of all like to thank all those noble lords who have spoken for their kind remarks to me about the bill <e> <s> i cannot really agree with the noble lord lord dean that there was very little work for me to do but that is my judgement against his <e> <s> i certainly found it a fairly busy week <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can do at this stage is to note the remarks of the noble lord because this is really a matter of a tax on gambling and not on football as i have said <e> <s> these matters do not fall only within the ambit of the home office as the noble lord will be aware <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will be aware that the wing in question deals with women who are very highly disturbed <e> <s> so far as a new site is concerned i believe that the recommendations which the report contains are positive <e> <s> obviously we must look very carefully at them and an urgent feasibility study will be carried out to assess the suitability of another site within holloway <e> <s> as regards staffing and other implications the noble baroness will be aware from the report that we are working closely with the dhss and its experts <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the noble lords concern i can promise him that <e> <s> what is important is that we achieve the right answer at the end of the day <e> <s> that is what has gone so sadly wrong in the past <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that we have identified a site but we cannot build on it overnight <e> <s> for example there may be all sorts of technical features such as the existing drains and so on beneath the ground at holloway which must be looked at <e> <s> that is why the feasibility study is being carried out <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that i am doing all i can to expedite it <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot be precise on the timing but my right honourable friend the home secretary has made it perfectly clear that he is trying to achieve this with great urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend has said that steps will be taken urgently to improve and expand the amount of space at present available for inmates association and activities <e> <s> in addition work will be carried out on such things as the lighting and so on which at the moment are very poor <e> <s> so that is in hand <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i have seen the report to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> he will be aware that there are difficulties <e> <s> certainly life is made more complicated in some respects by the mental health act and the fact that some people fall outside it <e> <s> however it is our belief that offenders who are mentally disordered within the terms of the mental health act should not be in prison and we are taking soundings and trying to look at a possible way forward for those who fall between the two stools <e>", "<cs> my lords i have visited holloway and i am well aware of that fact <e> <s> i too should like to express my thanks for the work that they do <e> <s> it is very difficult and some of the people with whom they deal are extremely disturbed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord feels that i do not express concern because i most certainly do <e> <s> as i have just indicated to the noble baroness lady lockwood the fact is that staffing levels are being urgently examined so that we can provide a full range of facilities and also provide appropriate and adequate psychiatric treatment therapy and nursing care <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord ennals indicated there are those people who do not fall within the scope of the mental health act and might not fall within the scope of the prison service <e>", "<cs> my lords all features of the report will be looked at most carefully and the dhss will certainly be consulted on matters in which they are involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to intervene when the noble lord has only just started his speech <e> <s> i am put in a rather difficult position when the noble lord refers to so many individual cases <e> <s> there is absolutely no way that i can refer to these cases tonight refute them or even put my case on them <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not draw out too many individual cases because it would take rather longer for me to research them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord avebury for his explanation of his bill and for the opportunity it gives me to explain the governments position in relation to it for although it is a short bill and to the point when compared with the existing bail provisions contained in the immigration act its implications are far-reaching <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to the noble lords point lies in the words in clause substantial grounds <e> <s> as far as i know there is no adequate definition of substantial grounds and they would introduce a problem which would be quite unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks whether it is a committee point <e> <s> it is nevertheless a major part of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord has the words substantial grounds clearly written into clause <e> <s> i am telling him now that in respect of the bill as it is at present written that would be the effect of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware as the noble lord himself is aware of the problems posed by the prison population but we are talking about not all that many people and i have given some statistics to the noble lord to indicate that what we are talking about here is a question of need <e> <s> the principle is the important thing to deal with that particular need <e> <s> the detail that i am putting on it is merely to indicate the sort of costs which might be needed should this bill go through <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may refer i ought to have done so earlier and i apologise to the noble lord to the question of supervised departure <e> <s> our policy is to use the procedure in all suitable cases <e> <s> there has been a drop in the number of supervised departures in following various particular difficulties <e> <s> we are now seeking to ensure that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their comments about the statement and i am certainly grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for his tribute to mr justice popplewell and to those who helped him produce the report in such good time <e> <s> also i entirely share his views which have been expressed before about the heroism which was shown by so many at the time of the fire <e> <s> may i just clear up one point that the noble lord lord wigoder asked about early on concerning the date when the report was received <e> <s> it was received late on th july which answers that point <e>", "<cs> my lords what i can say is that my noble friend lord elton listed the features of the convention in a written answer to a question from my noble friend lord campbell of alloway on th july <e> <s> it is in the <e>", "<cs> my lords we turn now to the issue of expense which seemed to be very much the theme of the understandable concern of the noble lord lord wigoder <e> <s> the financial implications of safety improvement work are being considered by the working group which was set up by my right honourable friend the prime minister following the bradford tragedy <e> <s> this committee is chaired by my honourable friend the minister for sport <e> <s> a preliminary estimate of work required at newly designated third and fourth division football clubs has been produced by the football grounds improvement trust <e> <s> the working group will now need to consider the implications arising out of mr justice popplewells interim report and also the chief fire officers inspections <e> <s> until those components have been taken fully into account it is too early to consider how much and from what source funding might be available <e> <s> but i am sure your lordships will bear in mind that it is the responsibility of football clubs or for that matter organisers of any event to ensure proper spectator or audience arrangements within their grounds within cinemas or whatever they may be <e> <s> this is in common with so many different parts of our world of entertainment <e> <s> to mitigate the effects clubs can always accept a lower spectator ceiling based on average attendances rather than the full or very full attendances which they might have on special occasions <e> <s> that should help to a very large degree <e>", "<cs> my lords i note my noble friends concern <e> <s> on the question of fire safety there might well be an element of unfairness and i am grateful to him for pointing that out <e> <s> on the question of alcohol at football grounds we have been over this subject and we must give it time to work <e> <s> as i said when the bill was going through this house we shall look at the effect it has on football clubs and no doubt that effect will become apparent very quickly when we come to consider public order legislation <e> <s> i cannot go beyond that now <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly note the noble lords concern <e> <s> the question of a debate is a matter for the usual channels not for me <e> <s> the final report will come out in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly welcome the comments of the noble lord on that paragraph <e> <s> i am sure that that view is shared by many <e> <s> it is certainly by me <e> <s> so far as all visiting fans are concerned i am aware that the report is far-reaching and what is said in the governments response to the recommendations is correct <e> <s> it is essentially a matter for the football authorities to sort out and i hope as we all hope that at the end of the day we shall come up with a sensible and realistic solution to this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords one thing which is absolutely guaranteed to mean the end of football is the continuation of the violence that we have seen <e> <s> let there be no doubt at all about that <e> <s> while the noble lord suggests that the introduction of membership cards may be moving in that direction as well all i can say to him is that it is a matter for the football authorities <e> <s> i do not believe that it is impossible to work out some scheme but one thing has to be balanced against another the issue of violence on the one hand against practicability on the other hand <e> <s> those matters are being considered <e>", "<cs> my lords that is really a matter for the certificating authority to look at <e> <s> as he does i appreciate that locked turnstiles produce the sort of tragedy that we have seen <e> <s> that is why it is important that these recommendations particularly the ones relating to safety on egress from a stadium are looked at carefully but i believe that they are a matter for the certificating authorities to deal with rather more than me <e> <s> but i note the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many reasons why the numbers of people sentenced to youth custody centres have risen as the noble lord suggests but the fact is that a great many of them have had nearly every conceivable form of non-custodial sentence imposed before <e> <s> it is my belief and i have certainly been encouraged by what i have seen in youth custody centres up and down the country that the sort of regime which is offered by them is one which is only good for those who are there <e> <s> in regard to reconviction rates we have not got information yet because the statistics go back some time but of course we keep it all under review <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to my noble friend lies in the fact that there is a general growing acceptance that determinate sentences make for a franker dealing between staff and inmates <e> <s> i cannot share my noble friends view that there is a gap in the sentencing <e> <s> of course detention centres for juveniles exist but i believe that the regimes that are offered by youth custody centres are in the interests of those who are in them <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly there are those who are going to youth custody centres who are assessed in local prisons <e> <s> this may be the point the noble lord is driving at <e> <s> in regard to juveniles generally they can be held in adult prisons only for temporary purposes such as allocation or where the net sentence is less than days <e> <s> on the latest information available there are but juveniles in adult prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is over but if i am wrong i shall let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble baroness that we monitor very closely all developments in youth custody sentences over a wide range of matters and bullying is certainly one of them <e> <s> but we do not have any evidence to suggest that the position is significantly different now compared with the borstal system <e> <s> i certainly share the concern of the noble baroness about bullying <e> <s> it is something that we keep our eyes on very closely <e>", "<cs> my lords of course my right honourable friend the home secretary keeps a close eye on all these related issues <e> <s> as the noble lord will understand he cannot necessarily interfere in the way the judiciary deals with this <e> <s> but i can assure the noble lord that there is not quite the dissatisfaction generally which he seems to feel over the sentencing of youths <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends welcome for the measures <e> <s> yes soft drugs are included <e> <s> although the advertising campaign is targeted against heroin it is not confined to it and should help in soft drug areas <e> <s> so far as concerns the administration of the money in pakistan and elsewhere that will be done by the united nations fund on drug abuse and control which reflects the international concern at the drug menace <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord is pleased that the increase in the number of customs staff is taking effect <e> <s> there was of course a difference of emphasis in days gone by about what was best designed to meet the menace but this measure should be effective <e> <s> so far as the eec is concerned i do not think i can go further than to say that it is an international problem <e> <s> i do not have figures on the eec with me but the un fund which i mentioned to my noble friend just now is one source which covers the eec as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i have not got that information but i shall let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords i said earlier in answer to my noble friend that this was an international menace <e> <s> all those concerned internationally will take whatever steps they possibly can to meet the problem <e> <s> that is why the united nations look upon the matter as seriously as they do <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly international in the widest possible sense but i do not think i can take the answer any further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i did explain in answer to my noble friend that legislation is being proposed to allow for the tracing the freezing and the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures they have given have been misleading <e> <s> yes there has been a reduction but since the number of preventive <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness is referring to what i believe are known as designer drugs and angel dust is merely one of them although i do not know for sure i can say that we are monitoring the situation carefully and we shall not hesitate to take action under the misuse of drugs act if necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that perhaps the noble lord had better await the bill and see what it contains <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful both to the noble lord lord mishcon and to the noble baroness lady seear for their expressions of sympathy both to the police and to the victims in these terrible circumstances <e> <s> i am also grateful for their round condemnation of the kind of action which has been taken by those who employ violence such as we have seen <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness points to what she believes to be the difficulties caused by constraints on local authority spending preventing action to tackle the sort of problems she is concerned about <e> <s> however i am sure the noble baroness will be aware that the government give birmingham substantial support under the urban programme <e> <s> they allocate million per annum to the partnership and high priority is given to handsworth where some million has been spent in the last five years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful indeed to the noble viscount lord tonypandy for his remarks in support of the police <e> <s> of course they deserve every word of what he said <e> <s> the noble viscount referred to those among certain parts of society who foment trouble <e> <s> extremists will seek to make political capital out of disorders of this kind <e> <s> their presence does not help but there is no evidence that the disorders were organised in advance by external agitators <e> <s> all the indications are that the disorders were local that they were criminal and hooligan rather than political and externally organised <e> <s> with that i can simply share entirely the noble viscounts sentiments and agree with every word he said in support of the police <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> certainly pouring money into areas such as this is by no means the only solution <e> <s> that is why the problem has to be tackled on a much wider front in much the same way as i suggested in answer to the noble lord lord mishcon that it was being tackled <e> <s> so far as local authorities rates bills are concerned it is true that they do lead or can help to lead towards the sort of difficulties that we face <e> <s> i think that my noble friend is quite right to put his finger on it <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate puts his finger on one area which came out in the report on the earlier riots on which the noble and learned lord lord scarman reported <e> <s> may i say to him in relation to employment here that training and special programmes have been reviewed in the light of that report <e> <s> many relevant initiatives have been taken <e> <s> small businesses have been encouraged there are local enterprise agencies enterprise allowances and an expansion of the small firms service <e> <s> training has been reviewed i referred to the new two-year yts <e> <s> there has been a vast expansion of the community programme with billion spent annually on special measures and special consideration is given to the schemes and projects which he no doubt desires to see in inner cities <e> <s> recreation and leisure schemes are also supported under the urban programme <e> <s> i think that that action indicates that we have concern in the way that he desires <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that the sort of things we have witnessed may be to some extent involved with drugs but i think that a lot of it has to await the further inquiries which are taking place <e> <s> certainly i from this dispatch box and many of my noble friends in the past and others in another place have condemned in every way the drug barons to whom the noble lord referred <e> <s> he further knows that all being well it will be possible before long to introduce legislation to remove the proceeds from those who benefit from drugs <e> <s> but i do not think there is any conspiracy of drug traffickers to encourage rioting as such <e> <s> riots may simply be symptoms of something else which is occurring in those areas <e>", "<cs> absolutely my lords <e> <s> i hope that i had not indicated to the contrary <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i do not know whether or not any particular liaison has been made with the french but i shall certainly ask and will let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> my lords if i misinterpreted the noble lord i can only apologise <e> <s> i thought the indication of what he said was that he specifically referred to the need for that remedy to be available <e> <s> i shall certainly study the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords in picking up that point and also the point made by the right reverend prelate the bishop of southwark may i simply say that the governments immigration control has two objectives firmness as well as fairness <e> <s> i can assure both the noble lord and the right reverend prelate that we do pay due regard to compassionate features of individual cases <e> <s> if the noble lord feels otherwise i can tell him that that is not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable friend will note the remarks that have been made in this debate <e> <s> but i cannot agree with the noble lord in his suggestion that the immigration officers who deal with these cases are not compassionate in the same way as for example those in the home office when one gets to the top of the tree so to speak are also compassionate <e> <s> there has to be a measure of fairness and firmness together <e> <s> those are important features of any proper immigration policy and i do not believe that the suggestion of the noble lord that it is not compassionate at the moment holds water <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to study the remarks of the noble lord <e> <s> in the interests of time with rather more to say to cover all the points raised perhaps it is fair to deal with the one point i have dealt with and to come back to him in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the comments of both noble lords opposite on this statement <e> <s> i can perhaps first try to answer some of the questions asked by the noble lord lord boston <e> <s> he refers to the question of procedures of interrogation in the services the way that these people were investigated initially and also the question of the long periods during which they were detained <e> <s> these are perhaps both matters that will fall to mr calcutt to investigate <e> <s> i do not think that i can take them further forward now except to say that i am sure they will be looked into <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not of course possible to go into details on what transpired at the trial because the proceedings were <e>", "<cs> my lords can i say simply to the noble lord that i understand his concern <e> <s> can i say to him simply that if in the course of the investigations that mr calcutt will conduct into the way the service authorities dealt with these cases it involves the lines of communication leading to the noble lord shakes <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i know that is absolutely correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is a matter for me <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly study the noble lords remarks <e> <s> however i can say that i believe and i sincerely hope that i am not wrong that a complaint could be made to the police complaints authority under the police and criminal evidence act on the question of the metropolitan police special branch <e> <s> if i am wrong i can only apologise but i believe that to be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i can add nothing to what i said in answer to the noble lord lord wigoder namely that at the time of the earlier investigation there appeared to have been serious breaches of security <e> <s> that is as far as i can go <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable friend will note my noble friends remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a decision of my right honourable friend the attorney general <e>", "<cs> my lords in asking the question this evening the noble baroness has drawn attention to an area of our penal system which understandably often gives rise to emotion <e> <s> she has pointed to the need for a caring and responsible administration of the female prison system and i assure her that i and the prison department share her ideals <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord was referring to the remarks of mr anderson <e> <s> i do not have that particular quotation in front of me <e> <s> i shall have to study the remarks of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is internal within the prison department yes <e>", "<cs> my lords the prison will naturally be involved but those who examine it will come from outside the prison as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord is necessarily right <e> <s> he referred to newspaper bingo and as with telephone bingo it is not essential to make a payment to take part and the courts have not found newspaper bingo illegal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the gaming board will be discussing telephone bingo shortly and no doubt they will take note of my noble friends remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is quite right in that <e>", "<cs> my lords british telecom is already a private company <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware there are lots of other telephone numbers which can be rung for convenient information including challenge line which sets daily brain teasers <e> <s> unlike answers given at the dispatch box at question time the answers are given the following day <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said this a matter for the commercial judgment of british telecom <e> <s> however it seems to me that the scheme that they have devised is one which would stimulate more telephone calls and no doubt that will do what the noble lord wants <e>", "<cs> my lords the charge is for the telephone call not for taking part in the activity once one makes it <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that question goes rather wide of the question on the order paper <e>",

today <e> <s> i well remember how nervous i was and that is something of an understatement when i was privileged to perform the task which this year fell to my noble friend lady lane-fox <e> <s> i

box to any visits by my noble friend or any others at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that in years past we had our own water cannon and they were used in the early seventies in northern ireland as the noble and learned lord will remember <e> <s> we have not used them at all regularly since then but the germans and other nations have <e> <s> it was important that we looked at current ranges of vehicles <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right there are difficulties in their deployment in narrow streets with parked cars and that sort of thing <e> <s> however i am sure that the most important matter is to prevent the situation arising where this kind of measure is necessary in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the major difficulty is that water cannon do not carry the necessary quantity of water with them to suppress fires in the way that my noble friend would like <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that we have been faced with riots <e> <s> as i said just now in answer to the noble lord lord hunt it is important that we make every effort to prevent the kind of situation occurring in which in any sense it might be necessary to use measures of the kind for which water cannon were designed <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i think the noble and gallant lord is right in saying that one can think of a scenario in which drenching with water would be preferable to the use of either cs gas or plastic bullets <e> <s> however i still stand by what i said that it is important that the situation should not arise at all <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> a proposal for a new convention to deal with drug trafficking was brought forward by the venezuelan government at the united nations general assembly last year <e> <s> her majestys government firmly support this proposal <e> <s> our suggestions and comments on the elements that such a convention might contain were placed in the library on rd july <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the aspects which is considered and of course my noble friend will see that it is more fully set out in the paper <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can give the noble lord that assurance <e> <s> no doubt he will be aware that my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary recently visited pakistan and there he was able to announce the provision of further united kingdom financial assistance with crop substitution and rural development projects and also for law enforcement measures in that country <e> <s> it is right that all countries should be involved and that is what we are doing our best to encourage <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that question was really answered by my answer just now <e> <s> my honourable friend made that announcement of an extra million to pakistan for precisely what the noble baroness seeks crop substitution <e> <s> that is one of the ways in which this problem can be tackled <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all money has been given to the inner cities in vast quantities over the years to meet the very real problems which they have <e> <s> secondly it is for inner city authorities themselves to deal with many of those problems but there are cases of local authorities throwing away some of the benefits of the money which comes to them by spending at levels which they know will reduce their grant entitlement and impose extra burdens on local people <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is i suggest quite wrong in his attitude towards the suggestion that just throwing money at problems will always solve those problems <e> <s> there are serious problems and they are not problems which can be treated just by spending money on them <e> <s> there are many ways in which they must be tackled <e> <s> that is what the whole government and not just one particular department are trying to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the national economy must thrive if the inner city economies are to thrive <e> <s> to secure national economic recovery we must of course rein back on public expenditure on further taxation and on everything else <e> <s> it is no use noble lords opposite saying that one can just treat those problems by spending more <e> <s> with regard to the riots we have seen there can be no excuse whatsoever for the kind of lawlessness which has appeared on the streets <e> <s> it must be tackled at every possible level <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i do not have a copy of that particular press notice with me <e> <s> however i can tell the noble baroness that the government have said that they agree with the monopolies and mergers commission that the bbc and independent television companies should in their journals be responsive to public requirements <e> <s> we have written to the bbc and to independent television publications limited asking for their reaction to the commissions report <e> <s> we have not yet received their reaction <e>", "<cs> my lords it was because of the concern which we felt that we wrote to the bbc and to independent television publications <e> <s> when we receive their answers we shall be in a position to give the information which the noble baroness seeks <e> <s> if she will put down a specific question for written answer i shall be delighted to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course study the press notice with great care <e> <s> however i cannot give a written answer without the noble baroness tabling a specific question <e> <s> if the noble baroness wishes me to write to her of course i will do so and a copy will be placed in the library in the usual way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right when he says that the conclusion was that the practices in question were not contrary to the public interest <e> <s> so far as the peacock committee is concerned i can say only that it will be reporting round about the summer <e> <s> i cannot be more specific than that <e>", "<cs> my lords the largest constituency is the isle of wight with electors and the smallest is the western isles with electors <e> <s> the average electorate for all the constituencies in the united kingdom is <e>", "<cs> my lords there are difficulties associated with the co-terminusity if that is the right word to use between different boundaries boundaries of local authorities and of constituencies <e> <s> however i do not think that this matter can be looked at earlier than when the boundary commission is scheduled to consider it which will be between and <e>", "<cs> my lords it may indicate all sorts of things but i think that comment goes wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble viscount puts his finger on a very good point <e>", "<cs> my lords we have said that we should like the select committee on home affairs in another place to carry out a review of the procedures <e> <s> failing that we shall look at the other ways in which a review could be undertaken <e> <s> there is still plenty of time before the commission starts work <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i commented on those particular remarks of my noble friend <e> <s> i am sure they will be taken in good spirit in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that but i cannot go any further than i have done <e> <s> these matters will be considered when the commission looks at them in years to come <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> who commit violent assaults on laboratories and scientists <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to interrupt my noble friend but i give my reassurance that there is no question of an animal suffering in any sense having to await the bureaucratic process before it can be painlessly destroyed <e> <s> the individual holding the personal licence and doing the work will be able to perform that task <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an interesting and lively debate <e> <s> it has attracted expert scientists on the one hand and expert campaigners on behalf of animals on the other <e> <s> throughout the debate much varied experience and wisdom has come from so many of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i will expand on it because cosmetics in this context mean much more than just the kind of products which are customarily thought of such as lipsticks <e> <s> we are talking of items like soaps shampoos and even toothpastes <e> <s> these are by far the majority of the items covered by this term <e> <s> the substances are used by millions of people every day <e> <s> there is a clear duty to ensure that substances are safe for the user and safe for the people who spend their working lives producing them as my noble friend lord auckland has said <e> <s> we have to ensure that there is scope for the development of beneficial new products such as new toothpastes etc <e> <s> which contribute so much to the reduction of dental decay <e>", "<cs> it is in fact less than that my lords <e> <s> it is only a half of per cent <e> <s> of the total number of animal experiments <e>", "<cs> my lords i visited a company the other day <e> <s> i can only say from my experience that that company told me that the ld test hardly needed to be used at all <e> <s> there are areas such as the one which i have described where it is apparently necessary but the trend is very very much away from it <e> <s> i was greatly encouraged to hear that <e> <s> indeed i heard it from two establishments which i have visited over the last few weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not a catholic having heard that intervention <e> <s> our sunday is changing <e> <s> it will continue to change at least for some of us whether or not we pass legislation <e> <s> but the legislation before your lordships is for a change of degree not for a change of principle <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly neighbourhood watch schemes are proving as successful as we hoped they might be if numbers are anything to go by <e> <s> they have increased from some in january this year to approximately schemes now <e> <s> as regards bodies other than government taking part yes i think my noble friend is right crime prevention is a matter for all sections of the community <e> <s> we see a role for the building industry architects and planners in providing more secure properties and for the insurance industry in encouraging through the introduction of premium differentials house contents policy holders to improve their security <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i should certainly be happy to give the noble lord as much information as i possess perhaps in writing <e> <s> i realise that when these alarms go off they can be a nuisance to those living in the local community <e> <s> i shall gladly find that information and let the noble lord have an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord puts his finger on a very good point <e> <s> there are many precautions which individuals can take in their homes to make it difficult for burglars and it is important that every one of us should adopt sensible and prudent measures to help the police and all those who try to prevent crime <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that that pointed more to the serious dangers of sleeping after lunch <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable friend will note my noble friends last suggestion but he is right when he says that the crown prosecution service will not be in place nationally until october <e> <s> however in weighing up a matter such as this we must consider such questions as what would take the place of peremptory challenge if it were abolished or further restricted and the possibility that for example increases in challenge for cause might take up more time of the courts <e> <s> therefore we must examine the survey very carefully <e> <s> perhaps i may explain to my noble friend that the office of the director of public prosecutions will shortly start monitoring the use of jury challenge in those cases for which it is responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that is a matter which can best be taken into account in the light of the survey which i have described <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble and learned lord that the government fully recognise the significance of the jury system and the important role that it plays in this countrys tradition of criminal justice <e> <s> however as i think the noble and learned lord knows there have already been alterations to the number of challenges that can be made <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones referred to the question of stand by for the crown which is the other side of the coin <e> <s> i cannot go into much detail on the question of the trial which the noble lord knows was held <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble lords question goes rather wider than the question on peremptory challenge but i note his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords all these considerations will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have already referred to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i assured the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones that the whole question of right to trial by jury was an important part of this countrys tradition of criminal justice <e> <s> as regards the general balance of advantage and disadvantage all these matters wil be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords rapists must be caught and punished <e> <s> we fully support police efforts to solve these crimes and in per cent <e> <s> of reported offences in england and wales were cleared up <e> <s> we are encouraging the metropolitan police initiative which aims to overcome victims reluctance to report offences <e> <s> we support police initiatives offering advice on prevention to women <e> <s> we support firm action in the courts against offenders and my right honourable friend would consider granting parole to a rapist serving over five years imprisonment only in wholly exceptional circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords it would certainly be a permanent deterrent <e> <s> however i believe that the noble baroness is quite right when she says that many women are legitimately terrified of this sort of thing <e> <s> that is why it is important to note that stiffer sentencing is available and why every effort should be made to support the police in all they do to try to prevent this crime <e>", "<cs> my lords of course pornography and violence are naturally very likely to be the cause of some of this sort of thing <e> <s> i note the noble lords view as regards the guidelines of the bbc <e> <s> i think the whole question of violence might be helped certainly this applies to cases of pornography reports on the most recent case were published in the papers yesterday by the introduction of the bill in another place to amend the obscene publications act which if it comes to this house your lordships will be able to discuss <e>", "<cs> my lords all these considerations are taken into account when the court considers a case but i still believe that it is the general feeling that rape is such a thoroughly vile crime that every possible step should be taken to prevent it <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the answer in relation to schools but i can say that local police crime prevention officers are always ready to offer such advice and forces willingly supply speakers to talk to womens groups on how best to reduce their chance of being attacked <e> <s> so far as concerns schools i shall draw that to the attention of those concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords despite a recommendation of the heilbron committee in that defendants should not enjoy anonymity parliament nevertheless introduced anonymity in the sexual offences amendment act <e> <s> last year the criminal law revision committee recommended that defendants anonymity should be abolished and my right honourable friend is still considering that recommendation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right the interviewing of rape victims should be carried out by an experienced officer in these cases <e> <s> that person will often be a woman police officer <e> <s> the metropolitan police have special training schemes for women officers in taking statements and also for male detectives <e> <s> they have a course in sexual offences investigation technique and that is proving successful <e>", "<cs> my lords i think in answer to an earlier supplementary i said that a bill had been introduced in another place and that might be an appropriate time to consider that if it comes to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i know of no plans but no doubt the noble lords point of view will be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness is aware life imprisonment is available both for rape <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think that my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> international terrorism is terrorism which affects more than one country <e> <s> close co-operation is essential if we are to deal with it effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that i can answer that specific point <e> <s> however if people are concerned about individuals actually getting into a house it is very difficult to be specific about the nature of each individual effort <e> <s> i should certainly be very happy to look into the matter and let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of fora <e> <s> the matter is discussed at senior ministerial level and at official level at summit seven the commonwealth heads of government meeting the ten trevi and in the council of europe <e> <s> therefore a great deal is being done to meet this very serious problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the first thing i have to say is that i did not see the programme myself and so i do not think that i can comment on it other than to say that which the noble lord expects me to sad <e> <s> yes it is a matter for the independent authorities but i am sure that the weight of opinion which the noble lord and others of your lordships rightly draw to the attention of the authorities will be noted by them <e> <s> so far as the king of moroccos request is concerned again i am not familiar with that but i shall find out and if i can let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as this country is concerned those to which i have referred as the fora in which the matter is discussed are extremely helpful <e> <s> there are i suppose one or two which spring to mind which may not be as co-operative as some but i should not like to be held to any particular country off the top of my head <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as this country is concerned the noble lord will be aware that discussions are regularly held and that great care is taken to make sure that the highest possible standards are maintained <e> <s> so far as other countries are concerned i can tell the noble lord that both the international civil aviation organisation and the european civil aviation council have done a great deal of work to tighten up aviation security <e>", "<cs> my lords that was an interpretation which the noble lord put on the question which was asked from behind me <e> <s> i would agree that libya fit the particular charge that the noble lord makes <e> <s> so far as the concern expressed by my noble friend behind me is concerned they are not helpful <e> <s> there may be others as well but i do not have the facts in front of me <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend mentions airports <e> <s> i think i said in answer to the noble lord opposite that both icao and the european civil aviation council examine this closely and that they have done a lot of work to prevent hijacking and bombing of aircraft <e> <s> an inspectorate is another matter but i am sure that both these organisations keep that point in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that but i shall look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that people were killed <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had i think a useful debate on these codes <e> <s> i am grateful to noble lords for the many kind comments they have made about the net result of our deliberations on both the act and on the codes and for the encouraging remarks particularly of the noble lord lord wigoder and the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington who were kind enough to say that they thought that the codes were on the whole balanced and that they would be effective <e> <s> i am also grateful of course for the comments of the noble lord lord hutchinson about the home office draftsmen and about my noble friend lord elton <e> <s> i shall certainly pass on his kind remarks <e> <s> i am grateful too to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for his comments about the mentally handicapped <e> <s> as the noble lord will know i had responsibility in that direction myself <e> <s> i was pleased when i was transferred so to speak to see that the needs of the mentally handicapped had been met by these provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we shall have to await the results of the exercise first and when the chief inspectors report is published we should be able to give figures on how successful it has been by the spring of next year <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that both men and women are eligible though obviously they have to match up to the necessary requirements of strength and that sort of thing <e> <s> the whole idea is to encourage employers to let their people take part <e> <s> my noble friend is quite right when she points out that the availability of part-timers is far greater than that of the whole-time men <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether my noble friend is asking about part-timers or full-timers <e> <s> i can tell her that the part-time firemen make up about one third as against full-time <e>", "<cs> my lords the rural areas do not necessarily require the same level of attendance as would be warranted by attendance of full-time firemen <e> <s> certainly representations are made on a variety of issues and are fully taken account of <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to maintain a cost-effective fire service and there is no suggestion that part-time firemen are any less efficient than full-timers <e> <s> the fact is that in rural areas there is no need to have full-time people employed for the length of period for which they are normally used <e> <s> we have to bear in mind the needs of the service as a whole <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that there is no need for him to worry on safety on this score <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but the part-timers are able to respond within the four minutes that are required of full-timers <e>", "<cs> my lords should a fire break out then the part-timers will cope with it adequately <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think this debate has demonstrated and as the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead so clearly stated the bill before us is one with profound constitutional implications <e> <s> no one respects more than i the wisdom and experience of my noble friend lord broxbourne and that of his supporters who have aided him with this measure or indeed my noble friends success in picking this day of all days upon which to debate this subject <e> <s> no one who has pride in the history and heritage of this country which has traditionally acted as a champion of human rights could fail to consider seriously the concept embodied in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before i stood up to speak i had the horrible feeling that if i quoted anything somebody would come up with a counter-quote and that is precisely what has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords we should all be grateful to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney for providing us with an opportunity to discuss this difficult sensitive and emotive subject <e> <s> many of your lordships have sympathised with some of the concerns and intentions and indeed the compassion with which the noble lord has introduced his bill <e>", "<cs> clause states that a regulated procedure is <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to the noble lord lord adrian <e> <s> i am well aware as we all are of his great experience in the medical field <e> <s> as he described at present the decerebrate animal receives no protection from the law <e> <s> the only point at which the act has applied is during the act of decerebration itself and then only for warm blooded animals <e> <s> the decerebrate animal is undoubtedly alive but it is rather difficult to describe exactly what alive is <e> <s> it is almost completely intact it is breathing spontaneously and with intact circulation and its basic physiological processes continue <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord melchett foretold i have to start by disappointing him <e> <s> i cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> as he has described it seeks to make the killing of a protected animal a regulated procedure in all circumstances <e> <s> this would have the rather curious effect of requiring personal and project licences for all killing of animals including for example getting rid of the mice behind the skirting-board or killing poultry or any kind of animal for human consumption <e> <s> i cannot think for a moment that that is what the noble lord intended but anyhow that is its effect <e>", "<cs> during the second reading debate the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby described the nature of the bill in a few characteristically crisp words <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> i respect the concern which both the noble lord <e> <s> lord beaumont and my noble friend lord selkirk have expressed for the need to ensure that all persons who are licensed to carry out experimental procedures on living animals shall be competent to carry out their work <e> <s> it is certainly a concern which the government share <e> <s> but i am afraid that i cannot agree with the manner which either amendment proposes <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord selkirk asked whether it was implicit and the noble lord lord melchett asked whether it could be made explicit <e> <s> it is certainly implicit which i think reassures my noble friend <e> <s> i am certainly quite happy to see whether it is possible to find a suitable form of words to make it explicit in the guidelines <e> <s> i should not like to be held to exactly what that form of words should be but i think it is something that can be taken care of <e> <s> with that assurance i hope that the noble lord and my noble friend will be further assured <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly try to help my noble friend and the committee on this point <e> <s> first i think i am correct in saying that the age of applies to the existing act <e> <s> the personal licence which this is all about establishes the obligations and restrictions which apply directly to the individual researcher by means of conditions and above all those conditions will make the personal licensee responsible for the proper care of animals in his charge and for taking appropriate action to prevent and limit suffering <e>", "<cs> i note the concern that has been expressed by the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris and by others about the need to ensure that children are equipped for life and are properly taught <e> <s> the noble baroness <e> <s> lady phillips queried the difference between paragraphs <e>", "<cs> the first thing i ought to make quite clear and i endeavoured to make it perfectly plain at second reading is that animals are not used for the performance-testing of any sort of weapon <e> <s> i hope that is perfectly clear to the committee <e> <s> i endeavoured to stress it before but it is just possible that i did not stress it sufficiently <e>", "<cs> may i clarify in my mind whether my noble friend is speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am responding to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> although my noble friend has referred to amendment no <e> <s> and says that he does not intend to propose amendment no <e> <s> which i agree with the noble lord lord melchett is essentially on a different subject i take my noble friends point <e> <s> i do not know of course whether the noble lord lord beaumont will move his amendment amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> i mean amendment no <e> <s> just to prevent things becoming more confused <e>", "<cs> i cannot refer obviously to that document now <e> <s> i shall certainly look it up <e> <s> some of the names at least are reasonably familiar <e> <s> the fact is that it would do a great deal of damage <e> <s> what the noble lord suggests so far as i can tell is that only one pharmaceutical company in the country should be allowed to produce aspirin for example prepared in accordance with the british pharmacopoeia <e> <s> that seems to me to point rather in favour of nationalising every british company <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord does not feel that way <e> <s> i certainly do not <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord lord hunter has expressed the whole thing in a nutshell <e>", "<cs> i said that i would willingly read with great care but without commitment all that the noble lord had said <e> <s> i am not taking anything away with a view to bringing something back at a later stage <e> <s> what i said is that i shall carefully examine and read the noble lords comments and indeed those of others who have taken part in this debate <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to write to the noble lord <e> <s> but before doing so we shall all need to consider very carefully what has been said <e>", "<cs> i must say that i very much share the views which the noble lord lord northfield has expressed <e> <s> he referred to stress and i have to say that the experience of many experts in that field to whom i have spoken over the last few weeks bears them out <e> <s> i rather feel that this amendment would stand in the way of much very valuable scientific progress if it were accepted <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord does not want in any sense to stand in the way of the advancement of scientific progress <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord that that is the case <e>", "<cs> i am unhappy because i think that the noble lord really is exaggerating a little <e> <s> of course any suggestion that the animals suffer to the extent of losing their body weight by perhaps per cent <e> <s> is something in which the inspectors would take a very keen interest <e> <s> the noble lord has not spelled out exactly what sort of work he is referring to but i believe that he is introducing something of a red herring <e> <s> that is the sort of interest which the inspectors are expressly there for the purpose of examining <e> <s> i am sure that they will not let it go unnoticed <e>", "<cs> i agree that we should not prolong this but i am advised that the noble lord is quite wrong <e> <s> if i discover ultimately that the noble lord in any sense is correct which i simply do not believe is possible then i shall stand to correct what i have said <e> <s> but i honestly believe that it is something of an exaggeration and i do not think that he ought to be carried away by what he has read in some curious part of the world <e>", "<cs> this amendment provides us with a welcome opportunity to discuss issues which i realise have given rise to quite a measure of public concern as the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley himself said <e> <s> i must reassure him that the government recognise that there is considerable public concern about the draize eye irritancy test <e> <s> i have to say also that much of that concern regrettably has been deliberately manufactured by extreme opponents of animal experiments using emotive pictures at least some of which if not all have not stemmed from this country and there have been wildly distorted claims and reports taken out of context <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble earl is quite correct in that but i understand and it would be misleading if i were to say otherwise that occasionally there is a requirement with a very very mild final solution of whatever it is for it to be applied to the eye <e> <s> but certainly it is nothing like the original draize test to which the noble earl referred <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord beaumont has explained very carefully the particular reasons why he considers it necessary to enact and express prohibition on the use of animals for beauty <e> <s> he said he was not going to pursue the question of weapons but then the point was raised by the noble lord lord prys-davies <e> <s> perhaps i can reassure the noble lord on this matter quite succinctly <e> <s> it has been emphasised many times by the government that in the united kingdom animals are not used in work to improve weapons or ammunition performance <e> <s> this was a point i raised earlier in answer to my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard and i do not think there is anything i can add to it <e> <s> it simply does not happen <e>", "<cs> i note the noble lords wish that the products should be differentiated in that way <e> <s> i simply do not know whether it is possible <e> <s> frankly i doubt it because i suspect that it will put an enormous burden on the administration of those returns and also presumably on the scientific bodies and research organisations that provide them <e> <s> i may be wrong but i will certainly consider the noble lords suggestion without any commitment <e>", "<cs> i rather gathered from the nod that the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley gave to the noble lord lord northfield when he mentioned that it really was covered in the guidelines that i need not be particularly long in answering his point <e> <s> i can simply say that the question of whether an alternative method of research is feasible or whether a feasible method is available in any given circumstance is really highly subjective <e> <s> it is not something that the project licence applicant the inspector the secretary of state or anyone else can know for certain <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be to make the validity of a project licence dependent upon whether any feasible alternative method of research was available at the time the authority was granted which is something which cannot be determined in any clear-cut way <e>", "<cs> it is a little difficult to comment in any depth on the merits of this amendment <e> <s> quite honestly in the time available i have not been able to study the standards laid down by the secretary of state for the environment for the management of animals in zoos for reasons of which the noble lord lord melchett is aware <e> <s> my guess and that of my advisers is that they are not per cent <e> <s> apt for wild animals in laboratories <e> <s> i do not see any particular reason why they should be <e> <s> however what i shall do is to examine a copy of the standards to see whether they have anything to teach us about how to keep wild animals in laboratories <e> <s> i hope that at least that will be an assurance to the noble lord lord melchett <e>", "<cs> may i make one further point which relates to the point that the noble lord is making <e> <s> animals in zoos are there for a different purpose <e> <s> they are there for display <e> <s> they are there to demonstrate their lives their activities to people who come to watch them <e> <s> that is not the case with animals which are kept for laboratory purposes <e> <s> laboratories have similar facilities but they are not designed in the same way and they are not for the same purpose <e> <s> that does not mean to say that the animals concerned are not perfectly happy <e>", "<cs> i certainly understand and share the concern of those who have spoken in support of the amendment that animals used in experimental work are properly cared for at all times <e> <s> it is because of our concern that we have included in the bill the requirement that all designated scientific procedure establishments and all designated breeding or supplying establishments should have a specific named person <e>", "<cs> without repeating myself if the noble lord studies what i said he will find that his concerns are met and that he can be reassured <e>", "<cs> at a quick glance the provisions contained in the animal boarding establishments act look broadly on the right lines for the sort of animals that are held in boarding establishments <e> <s> but they do not of course cater for laboratory animals and they were not designed to either <e> <s> for example i refer to mammalian foetuses which certainly can need to be looked after in the way that we are referring to with laboratory animals <e>", "<cs> all i can tell the noble lord is that the animal boarding establishments act is concerned with the boarding of other peoples animals <e> <s> i think that is the answer the noble lord seeks <e>", "<cs> i will willingly write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i honestly cannot describe to the noble lord precisely how inspectors will be moved around but i do not think that he need be under any misapprehension they take the work they do extremely seriously <e> <s> i have heard first-hand examples of people who have been to a laboratory when an inspector has been visiting and he has stopped something there and then <e> <s> those are probably companies or laboratories with which the inspector has the sort of relationship that the noble lord feels might be too cosy <e> <s> i assure him that they will pursue their work rigorously <e> <s> in all seriousness i do not believe that there is the danger that he supposes <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that i can add to what has been said rising as i do again <e> <s> i urge the noble lord to think very hard about what he suggests <e>", "<cs> i certainly understand the concerns that underlie the noble lords amendment <e> <s> but the procedure that he suggests is i believe impracticable and misconceived <e> <s> it is not the function of the animal procedures committee to review all licence applications in whole classes as a matter of course <e> <s> the routine consideration of licence applications is properly the responsibility of the inspectorate <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has asked me to give him some figures <e> <s> i cannot give him precise figures <e> <s> however so far as the first category is concerned the number will certainly run into hundreds and there will be a few for the second category <e> <s> i canot give precise figures <e>

being made but one simply does not achieve results overnight they have to be planned carefully <e> <s> with regard to the interim improvements we have been looking in detail at the practical steps and in particular at improvements to the fabric and the replacement of potentially dangerous fittings together with the provision of more space for association improvements to the lighting and things like that <e> <s> but your lordships will understand that it has been necessary to assess the condition of the fabric in some detail before planning the changes which can be if real improvements are to be achieved <e> <s> this is being done bearing in mind the fact that we have said that we shall build a new unit <e> <s> i have read the report from the prison officers association and many of their concerns especially those expressed in the press release are being met <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last two points put by the noble and learned lord as regards the alteration of cells so that the prisoners can be observed that is a matter which is under detailed consideration as i described to the noble baroness <e> <s> one cannot just knock down walls and hope that solves the problem because the effects could go rather further than that <e> <s> so far as moving prisoners to another part of the prison is concerned we are faced with a great many of the same types of problems <e> <s> the fittings and so on in other parts of the prison which have been suggested as a possibility simply are not up to scratch <e>", "<cs> my lords the c unit at holloway is the special unit there for the <e>", "<cs> my lords they are being carried out but we need to assess precisely how it is to be done <e> <s> it is in hand <e> <s> the noble baroness looks at me as though i were not doing anything about it but i can assure her that making the fittings safe together with the lighting plumbing improved observation and the wall and floor coverings are all very much in hand <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we are monitoring the situation very closely <e> <s> the football league have supplied some information and we have asked for further details to be provided at the end of the year with a view to considering the possibility of an amendment during the later stages of the public order bill <e>", "<cs> my lords again i think it is too soon to draw firm conclusions about effectiveness in reducing the incidence of hooliganism within the grounds <e> <s> however there has been a falling off in the serious incidence of hooliganism so far this season taking the season as a whole <e> <s> of course we are only about halfway through the season so far <e> <s> on the noble lords latter point yes we are keeping a careful eye on it <e> <s> however there is no legislation within sight <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i must confess that when i saw the marshalled list of amendments and the later addition to it i thought that we were in for a great number of second reading speeches <e> <s> i fear looking at the list and studying it that this may well be the case <e> <s> a great many alternatives have been put forward <e> <s> i shall come back shortly to the remarks of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e>", "<cs> i think first of all that scotland is part of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is wrong <e> <s> if he studies the bill he will see that what he proposes will apply to scotland <e> <s> the fact is that the bill does apply to scotland because it is merely the existing legislation that has fallen into desuetude in scotland <e> <s> this bill rights that by deregulating throughout the whole of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord wishes to look at the example of sweden he will find that he has picked a particularly good example there is no regulation <e> <s> the effects have been particularly good for the purposes of the small shoptrader in particular <e> <s> other parts of europe have various forms of regulation <e> <s> what we are saying in the full light of what mr auld and his committee decided is that there is no other means short of total deregulation that would suit this country <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord wishes to follow the example of countries that are not as satisfactory as sweden in this respect that is a matter for him <e> <s> what i am trying to say is perfectly fair <e> <s> the fact is that sweden has a particularly good record that others may pursue <e> <s> we have examined this closely <e> <s> the noble lord can talk about other countries and give an example of how they may differ from the view that we take <e> <s> the fact is that sweden has a particularly good record of achievement in this respect <e> <s> we believe that the opportunities which we can gain from deregulation millions of people want this are ones that we should adopt <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord i wonder whether in embarking now upon the employment restrictions that are in the bill we are widening the debate that has been introduced by the noble lord lord lloyd <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i can follow the noble lord at this moment about glasgow in particular <e> <s> but i stand by what i said <e> <s> i believe that the noble lords ideas well-meaning though they are go rather wide of the amendment with which we are dealing <e>", "<cs> i must say to my noble friend that i never said anything of the sort <e> <s> i said that i supported the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale in his view that there had been a very decisive majority against the amendment which was put down at second reading <e>", "<cs> the right reverend prelate has explained that the amendment is effectively to act as a peg on which to hang the various alternatives which are to be put to us later and so i do not think that it is necessary for me to speak at length in answering some of the points that he has raised in the speech that we did not have the benefit of when sadly he could not be here at second reading <e>", "<cs> i should like to say to my noble friend that i rather hope that the view that he puts will be brought forward certainly by myself and i expect by other noble lords when we debate the individual amendments <e> <s> that is what i think the right reverend <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has asked me three questions which i shall endeavour to answer <e> <s> he is concerned about the relationship between the two scottish acts that are referred to in clause b of the bill <e> <s> all i can tell the noble lord is that they are pre-union acts <e> <s> these acts are still on the statute book but as the noble lord knows and describes they are deemed to have fallen into desuetude which is a purely scottish <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i can help my noble friend <e> <s> i am advised that my noble friend is correct in saying that if amendment no <e> <s> has been withdrawn then amendments nos <e> <s> and i am not quite clear about amendment no <e> <s> i do not think that comes into it would be inconsistent with the decision to repeal part iv of the act so those amendments cannot be moved <e> <s> i must confess that i was not aware myself precisely how this stood until about a minute ago <e> <s> but that is what i understand the procedure to be <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon made a helpful suggestion <e> <s> my noble friend lord colville has made another which i am advised would be rather more in order <e> <s> if my noble friend is happy to move that amendment then i am advised that that is perfectly acceptable if your lordships agree <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord seebohm and indeed to some extent the noble baroness lady seear have slightly widened this amendment although the noble baroness lady seear was suggesting that perhaps it would be appropriate to discuss the other planning provisions in connection with other amendments <e> <s> i shall confine my remarks to those concerned with the planning considerations which form the meat of the noble and learned lords amendment <e>", "<cs> we have had a long and carefully argued debate on this particular amendment <e> <s> i have listened with great care to all those who have supported it i have listened to the right reverend prelate who proposed it and i have listened to those who have spoken against it <e> <s> the one clear thing that i am left with in my mind is a question mark <e> <s> what is the basis for the reforms relating to this amendment and the revisions of the present law as suggested by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> perhaps they are to allow some liberalisation of the present law <e>", "<cs> that may be the experience of the noble lord but i have lived there as well and i have taken careful note certainly in my own local area <e>", "<cs> last week and i can assure the noble lord that two weeks ago when i went into aberdeen on the sunday morning i counted the number of shops open and there were very few indeed <e> <s> there might be more at the moment because of christmas but if the noble lord will allow me i should like to develop the argument which i was going to develop previously <e>", "<cs> the noble lord knows that it is the local authorities which should enforce this law in their areas <e> <s> the noble lord might be able to tell me just how popular those local authorities would be if they stopped half the shops opening in some parts of london which he and i know well which are open on a sunday because the public want them to be open <e> <s> they are not open because the shopkeepers specifically want to be open with no one around to shop they are open because of public demands that they should be open <e>", "<cs> i am referring to the effect of the right reverend prelates amendment and the amendment is quite clear it relates to shops where five people are concerned <e> <s> however it is the case that these goods are available elsewhere at present <e>", "<cs> absolutely <e> <s> the fact is that at present in shops where more than five people are employed it is perfectly legal to buy fresh milk and fresh fruit and vegetables <e> <s> that is as it may be <e> <s> we may at last he able to buy fish and chips in a fish and chip shop but at what price <e> <s> when we buy our sunday newspaper we are to be allowed to buy cigarettes which the noble baroness lady ewartbiggs agrees would be a good thing and of course sweets unless those who want them wait until after in the morning and buy them in the village shop or buy them at a garage <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale said restrictions will not however apply to places of worship or areas within their curtilage at which any item at all can be sold freely at any time <e>", "<cs> i thought that one of the aims of the right reverend prelates amendment was to discriminate in favour of small shopkeepers because that is where he feels that less damage will be done to sunday and more good will be done for the shopkeepers <e> <s> but the fact is that the auld report clearly says <e>", "<cs> i hate to interrupt the noble lord but is he aware that paragraph on the next page clearly says <e>", "<cs> this amendment reflects what i understand and the noble lord lord graham of edmonton understands was the most common suggestion made to the auld committee when they considered whether any form of regulation could work <e> <s> there were many proposals for reform by way of simply effecting a change in the machinery of regulation by revising the fifth schedule which of course deals with exempted transactions and this amendment seeks to revise the list of exemptions to bring the law into line with what no doubt are thought by my noble friend lord brentford and those who support him to be modern-day requirements <e>", "<cs> there is a great danger in following the noble lords argument about other countries <e> <s> other countries vary enormously in so many different ways that one simply cannot apply the rule of what is good in one country to what may hold good in this country <e> <s> what the noble lord should understand is that we are simply suggesting in this bill that shops may open and that shoppers may shop <e> <s> what the noble lord failed to point out is that at the end of the day demand will surely indicate whether or not what is being proposed is right <e> <s> if the shops are opened and people do not shop then it will be clear to us that we have got it wrong and the noble lord need not have the worries which he has expressed so strongly this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is any application for charitable status it is a matter which should be looked at extremely carefully by the charity commissioners <e> <s> it is a matter for them and not for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly aware of the feeling which the noble and learned lord expresses but as i said to my noble friend lord sandys the achievement of charitable status is a matter for the charity commissioners and not for the government <e> <s> so far as proscribing this organisation is concerned that again is difficult because such organisations would have to be unlawful and yet there is nothing unlawful about them <e> <s> on the matter of the appeal to which the noble and learned lord referred i understand that a date has been set for the hearing in february <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i understand the concern which the noble and learned lord expresses <e> <s> however there is nothing essentially illegal involved and what one must do in this case is limited by what can be achieved without impinging in any way on what is not illegal <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say what definition of religion is in fact within our law but what i can say to the noble lord is that the most effective way of discouraging any socially undesirable activity is to give it the greatest possible public exposure <e> <s> the more the dangers are revealed the less potent or attractive will they be <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is entitled to his point of view but when it comes to the actual question of the charity commissioners dealing with this matter the status of any body which seeks charitable status is a matter for the commissioners and not for the government <e> <s> the government appoint the charity commissioners <e> <s> nevertheless i shall consider the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of other new religions some are registered and some are not <e> <s> i should not like to be drawn on whether any of them try to break up the family <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as mr hubbard is concerned the noble and learned lord is quite right in saying that he appears to have been involved at the beginning of this <e> <s> he applied for entry clearance to visit this country in <e> <s> he declined to attend an interview with a british representative to establish whether he was genuinely seeking entry as a visitor and his application was later refused <e> <s> that decision was upheld by the independent appellate authorities and <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought there was great advantage in a body which is set to do that being independent in the way that the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the usual channels will take note of the noble lords view <e>", "<cs> my lords responsibility for recruiting special constables rests with the chief officer of each police force <e> <s> we encourage chief officers to recruit as many as they can usefully train and deploy <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly encouraging that the number of specials has increased in each of the last three years after the years of steady decline to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> also we must bear in mind that the significant proportion of wastage in recent years is due to the introduction in nearly all forces of a retirement age of and the removal of inactive members <e> <s> i certainly agree that they are cost-effective and we are doing what we can to encourage chief officers this is carried out through her majestys inspectors of constabulary during their annual visits to forces to increase recruitment where they possibly can <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly true in general that the special constabulary is more successful than the regular forces in attracting recruits from the ethnic minority communities <e> <s> as i think the noble lord will expect this is helpful in establishing a link between these communities and the police which can aid each of them in understanding the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> after such a lengthy debate i think i have to start from the basis that we do not believe that there is reason to restrict shop opening hours but that is a matter which we have discussed at length now on several occasions and so i will confine myself strictly to the difficulties that i foresee will be caused by this amendment <e>", "<cs> the fact is that since auld the demand has increased <e> <s> i think that paragraph is at the end of that chapter and i shall certainly study it <e> <s> but the point that is valid is that the increase has been maintained <e> <s> we are now at per cent <e> <s> and what i have just suggested to the noble lord lord stallard is that per cent <e> <s> of people shopping cannot represent lack of demand <e> <s> i shall now give way to the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord feels like that but what we have to work on is the basis of actual experience <e> <s> it is no good delving into the realms of hypothesis to suggest what people may or may not do when they walk past a shop <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the surveys have produced the figure which i have quoted <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> she makes the point about the consumers association and a very valid point that is <e> <s> before i come on to some other <e>", "<cs> the point is that many of the shops which are now open and which these people visit are open illegally <e> <s> those shopkeepers can be punished by the criminal law for being open <e> <s> if that is what the noble lord really wants to continue to be the case that people may visit shops and then the shopkeepers stand the risk of being punished by the whole weight of the criminal law i suggest that he has got it fundamentally wrong <e>", "<cs> i have often heard from the benches opposite the beguiling words there is no politics in this whatever subject it might be <e> <s> the noble lord may feel that there is no politics in it but i can tell him that there are certainly some enormous practical problems as well as the very real practical difficulty of local authorities changing their minds from time to time and compounding the problem <e> <s> i shall develop that in a moment <e>", "<cs> i was challenged on the point that there was no manifesto commitment <e> <s> i think it was the noble lord lord stallard who challenged me on that <e> <s> what i have to ask the noble lord lord stallard and <e>", "<cs> i cannot speak for another place but i think that the tenor of the view of the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester leads us all on to the question of whipping <e> <s> that is basically the tone of his suggestion <e> <s> if ever a whip has been imposed in this house i would suggest that it has been imposed by the bishops benches <e>", "<cs> i am not able to answer for the bishops <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friends behind me would support me in saying that there are all kinds of difficulties in whipping in your lordships house which apply no doubt both to the noble lords benches and to mine <e> <s> i do not think there is any use in following that route just now <e>", "<cs> that may well be the case <e> <s> the noble lord speaks with the experience of the other place which of course i do not have <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham has explained that he is taking all four amendments together and i shall respond accordingly <e> <s> i have to say to him that all these amendments seek to add alternative complications to the ragbag and that is not too strong a word that is the shops act <e> <s> all the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a few words before the noble lord lord graham <e>", "<cs> i really cannot allow the noble lord to say either that there are examples elsewhere of small shops declining or that in some curious way the government are letting down their supporters <e> <s> on the first point the fact is that the swedish example which we quoted more than once is a very good example of exactly how small shopkeepers have been helped despite the worst fears expressed <e> <s> on the other matter the fact remains that the government are only suggesting that shopkeepers and shoppers should have the choice <e> <s> i should have thought that is a far better way of dealing with the question of opinion polls which the noble lord so readily produces <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i have to say that i rather sympathise with the idea that lies behind the amendment <e> <s> various members of your lordships committee have been longing for me to sympathise all day long and now when i stand up to sympathise i do not seem to have the support of anyone else <e> <s> let me simply say that i think that the idea of the noble lords amendment was to make it absolutely clear and beyond doubt that when clause <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree with the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley and indeed with my noble friend lord selkirk that we should exercise control over the infliction of severe pain or distress <e> <s> but provision to do so is already contained in our new arrangements <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord melchett and the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs have voiced the concern which quite understandably many people feel about the source of animals used in experiments <e> <s> the government have always appreciated the need for the most rigorous control which will provide the best reassurance that animals used in laboratories are obtained in a proper manner <e> <s> that is why clause provides expressly for a condition to be attached to all project licences requiring the animals most commonly used in experiments those listed in schedule to be obtained only from a breeding or supply establishment designated under the bill and thus subject to the home secretarys control <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to collies <e> <s> i cannot say that i have any direct knowledge of collies but the kinds of breeds we are considering here are greyhounds to which he expressly referred and perhaps one or two other breeds from time to time <e> <s> greyhounds have a particular characteristic to do with some of their metabolic functions which makes them particularly suited to certain types of work <e>", "<cs> if he steals it there is no way that the source can be carefully controlled and i would have thought that point was answered by what i have just said <e>", "<cs> we are now delving into the realms of another aspect of the criminal law and i rather suspect it does but under what statute the offence would be committed i do not quite know <e> <s> i will endeavour to find out and let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may come back on one point that the noble lord lord melchett did not feel had been covered <e> <s> may i at the same time also reassure my noble friend lord selkirk on the question of dogs being stolen and subsequently being used <e> <s> that use evidently counts as handling stolen goods and would be prosecuted under the theft act <e> <s> on the question of greyhounds and retired greyhounds at that the noble lord is right when he says that a greyhound retired from racing can be purchased for use in experiments but the proviso is that the purchase must be lawful and the transaction has to be recorded <e>", "<cs> the noble lord really invited me to go back to my earlier answer <e> <s> i do not propose to go through it all again but i want to stress to him the fact that there is a need from time to time as i think he acknowledges to acquire animals which are not bred in establishments of this type because they are not bred regularly for this sort of work in the same way that certain other breeds of animal are <e> <s> i went on to say that the source of all animals would be subject to the very strictest controls and the noble earl lord halsbury has given another technical reason to the noble lord to indicate how an old and retired animal but nevertheless a useful one could be used for clinical experimentation which would lead to the advancement of science <e> <s> the noble lord must accept the fact that retired greyhounds are a certain source <e> <s> there will no doubt be other sources as well <e>", "<cs> i do not want to get up and down too often on this but the noble lord has just been explaining to me his concerns about greyhounds being provided from racing establishments <e> <s> he now tells me that his real concern is because they are stolen <e> <s> this is something about which i hoped i had given a reassuring answer to my noble friend lord selkirk <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can go over all the ground again but i hope the noble lord realises that the special use of greyhounds will in future have to be justified by reasons <e> <s> that seems to me the very nature of the kind of licences that we are talking about <e> <s> they are not used very extensively but there are certain procedures for which they are the ideal animal or as near as one can get to the ideal animal upon which to work <e>", "<cs> clause of the bill provides for the use under tight control of assistants to carry out a number of commonplace non-technical tasks in support of personal licensees <e> <s> to help my noble friend lord selkirk perhaps i may add that these assistants are authorised by the personal licence of the personal licence holder under clause <e>", "<cs> i was trying to find a way of helping the noble lord a little further <e> <s> he has expressed his understanding of the bill thinking that assistants were the sort of people who cleaned out cages and so on but it goes much wider than that <e> <s> as i have said the work is described in the guidance notes <e> <s> there is something which i can undertake to do if it would help the noble lord and that is to examine carefully what appears in the guidance notes and to see whether there is any scope for tightening this point up <e> <s> i do not really feel that it can be put on the face of the bill but i willingly agree to look at the guidance notes further <e>", "<cs> we are discussing now a group of changes designed to alter the provisions in clause relating to codes of practice and to insert in clause a requirement to vary or revoke the licences or certificates of those who breach such codes of practice <e> <s> i can perhaps first deal with <e>", "<cs> it is not too seriously impaired because i can leave out reference to that amendment and go on to the second or third amendment <e> <s> i can perhaps pick up the right reverend prelates point about the codes of practice <e> <s> as i understand it they will be available for the public should they need them <e> <s> i must confess that at this moment i am not clear in what way they will be available <e> <s> they are at the moment in the discussion stage <e> <s> they will be amended no doubt as a result of discussion on this bill and also because we are actively seeking comments upon them <e>", "<cs> i should like if i may to come to amendment no <e> <s> specifically in due course <e> <s> perhaps then i shall be able to make more encouraging noises to the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i was trying perhaps to jump ahead when i should not have done <e> <s> the second and third amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and attempt to insert in clause a reference to breach of a provision in a code of practice under clause <e> <s> i hope that i have it right this time <e> <s> such eventualities are already catered for by clause <e>", "<cs> the right reverend prelate referred me particularly to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> but in the case of amendment no <e> <s> the need to say that he shall publish would mean that the discretion of the secretary of state to publish would be removed <e> <s> at the same time however i explained to the right reverend prelate that it is our firm intention to ensure that a code of practice is made available <e> <s> the word shall is inappropriate in a situation where the secretary of state has discretion as to the number and nature of the codes of practice to be issued <e>", "<cs> if lord adrians amendment is accepted the re-use of animals that we are talking about will be permitted but only once under terminal anaesthesia and so far as the time is concerned i rather hope that the right reverend prelate was reassured by what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with the idea which underlies the noble lords amendment but i am quite convinced that it would be inappropriate to include it in the bill <e> <s> i shall endeavour to explain why <e>", "<cs> the animal procedures committee will certainly have an important role to play under the proposed new system of control <e> <s> it is therefore quite right that we should give the most careful consideration to the membership of this committee and i am glad that this amendment has given us the opportunity to do so <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can immediately answer that <e> <s> subsection says <e>", "<cs> with respect i think that that is covered by the phrase any other expenses <e> <s> i do not think that my noble friend need worry <e>", "<cs> i am rather surprised to hear the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley say that this is the sort of facility that he would like to grant any secretary of state under any piece of similar legislation <e> <s> i do not think that this is an acceptable position in which to place any secretary of state <e> <s> the existing wording of clause of the bill gives the committee scope to investigate matters which it has suggested to the secretary of state provided that he agrees <e> <s> the committee can also investigate matters put directly to it by the secretary of state <e> <s> this represents i think a reasonable balance of power <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord must have a rather more realistic understanding of the relationship that is likely to exist between the committee and the secretary of state <e> <s> it is delving into the realms of fantasy when he suggests that the committee will not be able to undertake the kind of work which he envisages when as we have said the committee will make a report which will stand before parliament and since in any case the secretary of state is responsible to parliament <e>", "<cs> the amendment adds nothing to the provisions already in the bill which it seeks to replace but instead has the effect of narrowing and weakening the formulation which describes the task of the animal procedures committee <e> <s> perhaps i may refer the committee to clause which states <e>", "<cs> i shall look at what has been said by both the noble lord lord melchett and the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> i do not entirely follow the noble lord lord airedale on what he said because the use of alternatives is an aspect of avoiding animal suffering <e> <s> that is where the noble lord is perhaps failing to grasp this particular matter <e> <s> having said that i shall look at it and see what can be done but without commitment <e>", "<cs> the animal procedures committee is intended to be an advisory body <e> <s> it says that quite clearly in clause <e> <s> it will not have any executive functions under the act those will go to the inspector <e> <s> the idea of the committee carrying out spot checks on applications for licences and certificates or on licences and certificates themselves is wholly inappropriate <e> <s> equally unacceptable is the idea of licences and applications existing as a sort of research library for members of the committee to browse in without regard to the background or context of what they are looking at and the extent to which this work may impede or prevent research work being started <e> <s> of course my right honourable friend will furnish the committee with the information it needs to carry out its functions under the act <e> <s> but this amendment goes far beyond this <e> <s> i must confess that even after hearing the noble lords brief explanation i cannot see how the proposal is supposed to help the committee or the secretary of state on the operation of the bill itself <e>", "<cs> did the noble lord say that he was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and as well <e>", "<cs> i am grateful <e> <s> i fear that i may touch on them because that was to be the grouping <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> removes the requirement that the dpp should bring or consent to any prosecution of an offence under section of the protection of animals act alleged to have been committed on an animal in a designated establishment <e> <s> that is wholly unacceptable <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i can go into quite the detail that the noble lord would like me to <e> <s> the fact is that the safeguard has been extended in this way partly because of the need to guard against what i know the noble lord acknowledges to be the possibility of these vexatious or ill-informed prosecutions <e> <s> that is where the important aspect of this protection really lies and what the noble lord seeks to remove <e> <s> i can certainly study the noble lords remarks and see whether or not he has a point and i <e>", "<cs> the period of three years is the common period for an extension of time limits for prosecutions <e> <s> the noble lord wants to increase that period in both instances to five years <e> <s> whatever the reasons for the noble lord wishing to do so he would succeed were his amendment to be accepted in departing in a major way from current practice <e> <s> i do not see why this bill concerning animals and all that goes with it should be quite so special as to need a major departure <e> <s> the amendment would propose a substantial and unacceptable change in the balance of prosecution arrangements set out in clause as well as being unusual <e> <s> for that reason i urge the noble lord not to press his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to both noble lords opposite may i say that i am grateful to them for their kind reception of this statement <e> <s> both noble lords have raised the question of the financial penalties which clubs will undergo <e> <s> i recognise what the noble lord lord mishcon said and the fact that safety is paramount will be recognised by those clubs too <e> <s> obviously those measures have to be taken <e> <s> certainly the owners or occupiers of sports venues of whatever sort must take responsibility for ensuring the safety of their customers and they too must meet the costs of safety improvements <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords <e> <s> every step will be taken to encourage such co-operation i give the noble lord that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can add to what i have already said on the question of executive boxes <e> <s> i know that the noble lord has a powerful concern about this subject <e> <s> he expressed it very clearly and admirably in the summer <e> <s> as i said we await further information <e> <s> i shall certainly draw the noble lords remarks to the attention of all concerned and i can assure him that they will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i note those points and i am sure my right honourable friend will do so too <e> <s> the noble lord lord dean asks about a debate <e> <s> that of course i cannot answer <e> <s> it is a matter for the usual channels <e> <s> certainly i did not promise a debate when i spoke at the interim report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite understand the concern which the noble lord lord adrian has expressed about the cost to universities and colleges where each individual in quite large classes of students has to obtain personal licences in order to carry out a small number of procedures <e> <s> even if only one procedure is carried out during a whole year the full fee for a personal licensee will be chargeable to the university or college in respect of each student so licensed <e>", "<cs> my lords in this amendment the noble lord lord beaumont has tried very hard to meet the drafting problem with the amendment that he moved on th december which would have required all personal licensees to be competent in anaesthesia euthanasia analgesia and animal care whatever the work they were to be engaged in <e> <s> this amendment only requires them to be competent in those areas if they are to work in those areas <e> <s> i readily concede as i did on th december that there is scope for adding to the guidance notes on these points <e> <s> the actual rewording of the guidance notes has not yet been completed <e> <s> it is subject to discussion as the noble lord will be aware but there is that scope available in it <e>", "<cs> my lords during the committee stage as has been indicated we discussed the issue of the performance testing of weapons in response to an amendment put down by the noble lord lord beaumont and also in the context of an amendment by the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> as the noble lords lord melchett and lord beaumont have both said i stated then that in the united kingdom animals are not used for the performance testing of weapons <e> <s> i made it clear that we allow the study of wounds inflicted by weapons but that is solely in work designed to produce better methods of treatment and i stand by what i said <e> <s> i believe that it is quite legitimate and as i said the animals are deeply anaesthetised when that work is done <e>", "<cs> my lords there are cases as i have described of the recovery of an animal from the impact of a plastic baton round being studied in order to determine the effect as the wound heals <e> <s> the animal concerned will be given analgesics and it will under some circumstances recover <e> <s> i can however assure my noble friend that there is no question of animals being used again <e> <s> it is a once-only experiment <e> <s> it is unfortunate that we live in times when plastic baton rounds are necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand my noble friend <e> <s> i cannot really see however that by putting it in when clause specifically says what the project licence shall be granted for and that <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that it is covered by paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure how often i can get to my feet on report stage <e> <s> however with the leave of the house if i may respond briefly to the noble baroness i do not think that i can go into the realms of hypothesis on other sorts of issues that might fall within this area <e> <s> what is clear from the bill and what was brought out in the earlier discussion is that no licence to do anything that is in the least outside the scope of the bill and does not satisfy the secretary of state will be granted <e> <s> that is the assurance <e> <s> it is an assurance that will be regularly scrutinised by the inspectors and by others <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble baroness need have any concern that something untoward will take place <e>", "<cs> my lords the first part of this amendment would require project licences to specify the manner of euthanasia to be employed where animals are to be killed <e> <s> i well recall that during committee stage the noble lord lord melchett made plain his concern for ensuring that the killing of experimental animals is always properly carried out <e> <s> i certainly share that concern <e> <s> but i do not consider that this amendment is a necessary or appropriate means to achieve it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that much will depend upon the technique to be used <e> <s> certainly exposure to carbon dioxide the noble lord referred particularly to method no <e> <s> is the kind of technique which i believe will certainly require specialist advice <e> <s> the answer to my noble friend therefore is sometimes but not always and much depends upon the technique that is to be used <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that no one will attempt to carry out this sort of procedure unless they are fully competent and trained to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord melchett said i indicated that i would carefully consider the subject in the light of our previous discussions and that i have done <e> <s> however i must tell him that i remain of the view that this amendment would not be suitable for inclusion in the bill <e> <s> i shall deal first with the paper referred to by the noble lord lord melchett and subsequently raised today <e> <s> this was a paper by two persons employed as senior members of the medical staff of the department of health and social security though i understand that the document was not an official production of that department <e> <s> the paper reviewed the new medicinal products licensed in the united kingdom during the period to <e> <s> others of your lordships may not have had the benefit of seeing this paper so i shall be brief and i shall not go into too many quotations <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that i recognise that concern <e> <s> we return in essence to the fundamentals of the bill and that is the need to ensure that project licences are given only in areas where it is essential for the work to be carried out <e> <s> obviously i cannot speak for the drug companies but research will continue and research that involves the use of animals will be minimised <e> <s> that is the purpose not only of the drug companies but also of the bill in the sense of the project licence issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first say that we attach the highest importance to encouraging and promoting the use of alternatives a point which the noble lord lord somers has just made <e> <s> it is a factor to which the secretary of state will give the closest attention in deciding whether to grant project licence applications <e> <s> if i may anticipate the amendment which was referred to by the noble lord lord prys-davies amendment no <e> <s> which we shall consider later there is further evidence of the importance which we attach to this issue in that amendment <e> <s> that amendment seeks to insert in the terms of reference of the animal procedures committee a specific requirement to have regard to the protection of animals against unnecessary use in scientific procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords we entirely accept the need for proper and adequate supervision of animals at times when they are exposed to a significant risk of pain distress or other kinds of harm <e> <s> where supervision is required we shall insist upon it <e> <s> however i am afraid that the amendment while laudable in its aim is not an appropriate way of regulating these matters <e> <s> it is however a subject on which we accept the need for more explicit guidance to those carrying out procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be able to be very brief as regards this amendment and hence reassure your lordships <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett has made clear his concern to ensure that so far as possible the dogs and cats supplied to laboratories for use in licensed experimental procedures are purpose-bred and not stolen pets <e> <s> the government have the utmost sympathy for that objective and indeed that is one of the reasons why we have included the requirement now contained in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think that the thrust of the remarks of the noble lord lord melchett was to prevent cats and dogs being used for scientific experiments <e> <s> that is the whole argument that we had in committee <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that we do not want the wrong animals to end up in laboratories <e> <s> i had hoped that that would be welcomed by your lordships <e> <s> i hope that the right reverend prelate now understands what i am driving at <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> with the leave of the house may i say that we certainly agree with the noble lord lord airedale that the amendment must go further than belief in good faith that the animal is not a stolen pet <e> <s> the noble lords point is well made <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment would be to encourage the secretary of state to provide for a fee if he wished copies of information supplied to him in support of applications made under clauses or that is applications for project licences but not personal licences or for certificates of designation of scientific procedure breeding or supplying establishments <e> <s> the secretary of state would be able to put a condition on the disclosure and in deciding what to disclose he would by virtue of the proposed subsection be obliged to take into account the interests of the people who supplied the information that is the applicants <e> <s> the effect is that the secretary of state may provide this information to the public on request he has some discretion in the matter but there is a clear presumption in favour of disclosure <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a useful debate on a subject which i recognise is one which generates a great deal of concern <e> <s> i also recognise the point made by the noble lord lord houghton who after all has been very much the driving force behind the bill and has been an enormous help to the government that what we are trying to achieve is a consensus <e> <s> that has been the whole history of the bill and i know that the noble lord lord houghton is aware of it <e> <s> all the amendments to the bill have been with general agreement although it is quite clear that we have not found general agreement on this proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i simply say that i am grateful to all those who have responded so warmly to the amendment <e> <s> the two questions of my noble friend lord selkirk perhaps go slightly wide of the amendment but i give him the assurance that the term biological includes a professor of animal behaviour which i hope is the point about which he is concerned <e> <s> he raised an important point about the chairman <e> <s> the chairman can be anyone obviously someone competent but not necessarily with qualifications that others may need <e> <s> i was most interested to hear his comments and i should like to study them further <e> <s> whether the should be extended to may be worth considering <e> <s> it is a valuable point and i shall certainly take it away and look at it <e> <s> i commend the amendment to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord melchett has explained the text of this amendment is taken from section of the food and environment protection act which provides for the issue of codes of practice to guide the suppliers and users of pesticides in meeting their statutory obligations <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett is certainly extremely inventive if that is not too strong a word in spotting correspondences between all kinds of legislation and transplanting bits from one statute to another <e> <s> however i am afraid that the operation is not always a success <e> <s> what may be necessary in a section dealing with codes of practice about pesticides cannot be assumed to be appropriate in a provision dealing with information and codes of practice concerned in various different ways with the use of animals in scientific procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first time that we have discussed anything to do with schedule to the bill <e> <s> in view of the lateness of the hour i shall resist the temptation to go into a further description about other parts of the schedule that have not been raised <e> <s> i will simply say to the noble lord that our advice is that the suggested additional safeguard that he proposes is not necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i straightaway say that i share the concerns that many express about the unit but it is important to get the changes to the present unit right and to get the new unit right as well <e> <s> the noble baroness asked for an estimate on cost and on timing for the new unit <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot yet give her that information <e> <s> but as i said the improvements to the present unit are going ahead and i have every confidence that they will come forward in the not too distant future but it is important to get them right <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be delighted to consider the invitation to accept a delegation if somebody contacts me to let me know precisely what it wants to talk about <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have made clear on earlier occasions it has been necessary to assess the condition of the fabric in some detail before planning the changes that can be made <e> <s> the detail has necessarily to be gone into if real improvements are to be achieved <e> <s> i desire the same aims as the noble lord but we shall not get anywhere by rushing <e> <s> i can tell him however that the matter is being gone into extremely thoroughly and the results will be worth having at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords one does not build new units to replace old units in prisons overnight <e> <s> we have agreed to undertake the planning of the new unit <e> <s> progress towards that is being made in conjunction with the dhss taking up the recommendations made in the holloway project report <e> <s> in the meantime we are taking steps to put right where we can the shortcomings of the present unit <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already taken steps to improve the management of the unit <e> <s> interviews for the selection of a suitable doctor in the post of senior medical officer with responsibility for c have taken place <e> <s> the senior medical officer will have a key role to play in the creation of the right management framework and also in the provision of an appropriate regime <e>", "<cs> my lords first there had to be a discussion on precisely what was required and how it should be done <e> <s> then there was a finalised brief dealing with the preparation of a technical design for the builders and so on <e> <s> now we proceed to detailed working drawings and eventually the matter has to go out to tender <e> <s> it is easy to suppose that adjustments to a building like this can be undertaken without much planning <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the greatest possible care is being taken to make sure that we get these things right <e> <s> the next step is to prepare the detailed working drawings as a basis for inviting tenders for the necessary work <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no target date as such because we are trying to do the job as speedily as we possible can <e> <s> i go back to what i said earlier <e> <s> it is important to get this right <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the staff at holloway do an extremely good job <e> <s> i agree that the situation there is difficult <e> <s> as to regional secure units that programme is growing quite fast <e> <s> i believe that of the regions now have these regional secure units <e> <s> i have no more up-to-date information than that <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of things to be improved such as the removal of the light fittings and having them recessed into the roof and the replacement of certain facilities basins and lavatories and making them less destructible <e> <s> there is work to be done connected with what one actually sees through the door of a cell so that prisoners can be properly observed and various other things as well <e> <s> the hope is that at the end of the day these cells can be taken out of commission two at a time so that work can be done on them <e> <s> but it is important that proper structural considerations are taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords the interim unit suggested by the prison officers association is not a practical alternative <e> <s> many of the problems that exist in the c unit would be found in the unit that the noble baroness is i believe thinking of <e> <s> as to improvements carried out so far the work has been done on certainly one if not more than one cell with a view to improving visibility <e> <s> it does not need to be assessed it is not a question of simply jumping at it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> it has nothing to do with funds at all <e> <s> it has merely to do with the care and essential features of the work to be done in order to make sure for example that in taking down a wall to improve facilities we are not doing structural damage to the prison <e>", "<cs> my lords as we would all expect this has been an excellent debate <e> <s> we have been particularly fortunate in being able to hear from a number of your lordships whose valuable contributions to the debate stem from a close personal experience both of hong kong and of china <e> <s> understandably our discussion has gone rather wider than the substance and detail of the draft order in council attached to the nationality white paper <e> <s> it is right to do so since we need to see how the draft fits into the wider picture <e>", "<cs> my lords if i said nearly and i should have said every speaker i apologise unreservedly to the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i may cover the other point which he raised when i have a chance to respond to the whole issue which i am about to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly shall take account of it <e> <s> i shall take account of it with my honourable friend the minister and others in the way in which i said that i would take account of the other views which have been expressed on this particular issue <e> <s> if i have misrepresented the noble lord in saying that it was a view which he was expressing when he was in fact representing the views of people in hong kong then i apologise to him and to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly look into the matter but i am not aware of any particular cases <e> <s> if anyone knows of any particular cases then if we can have the details they can be followed through <e> <s> however it is impossible to do so without knowing the details <e>", "<cs> my lords in his intervention the noble lord has just beaten me to the next note to which i was going to refer in answering that point <e> <s> multiple visit entry clearances of limited validity are already available for business visitors <e> <s> this facility is not currently available to ordinary visitors and there are no plans for extending these arrangements generally <e> <s> however i note the noble lords comments on this and i shall pass them to my right honourable friend for his consideration <e> <s> i hope that that at least gives him something of an assurance on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly think i shall have to write to my noble friend <e> <s> i cannot respond to that question now but i shall note it and let him know as soon as possible <e> <s> i hope i have clarified the point on paragraph but i shall study my noble friends remarks on that and write to him on that too <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that i can go further than what i have already said <e> <s> it is the policy of the government to seek to achieve a peaceful resolution of terrorist incidents by a process of negotiation <e> <s> this might involve minor concessions such as the provision of food but stops short of conceding substantive political demands <e>", "<cs> my lords i really cannot go further than what i have already said <e> <s> i have given to the noble lord the policy which the government have followed in incidents that have occurred in this country <e> <s> i do not think i can be drawn further <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with that remark <e> <s> yes mr waite has done a tremendous amount of service and for that we should all be thankful <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> we have had a long debate on this issue <e> <s> it is the first of many concerning shopworkers a different theme from that which has occupied us in the earlier two days in committee and indeed earlier this afternoon <e> <s> the amendment is similar to the next amendment no <e> <s> in that it seeks to reinstate the employment restrictions of the act for shopworkers but i suggest is much more lavish in that it seeks to reinstate the restrictions for all shopworkers up to the age not just those up to the age of to which we shall no doubt come later <e> <s> this would in effect mean that the current employment provisions of the act will continue to apply to the vast majority of shopworkers not just to those aged between and as the bill intends <e>", "<cs> what i am saying is not at all that they do not matter to the workers <e> <s> i am sure that they matter to the workers <e> <s> they matter to all sorts of people <e> <s> what i am saying is is it the kind of matter which should be written into the law in the way that exists under the act and is it not something <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord stockton makes the valuable point that it has existed for many years <e> <s> what i am trying to suggest to the committee is that just because it has existed for so long it is not necessary now to maintain it because the conditions have changed <e> <s> i am endeavouring to explain that circumstances have changed and to develop the argument so as to explain precisely why they have changed <e> <s> the fact is that they are ineffective in controlling the length of the working week or day because they do not set maximum hours for adults <e> <s> here i am talking about the provisions which already exist <e> <s> as i have said there is no reason why shopworkers like their counterparts in other sectors of the economy and probably many of us have direct experience of precisely this should not settle their conditions of employment with their employers <e> <s> this is a theme which was developed by my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> i now turn to the question of the wages councils <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the noble lord is right in saying that there is no one to negotiate for them <e> <s> let us take some of the instances which we shall need to explain the situation <e> <s> let us take for example meal breaks under i think section of the act <e> <s> are we really to believe that adult shopworkers are unique among employees in that they are unable to sort out their tea and meal breaks with their employers <e> <s> are we really to believe that they want or need the full weight of an act of parliament to determine those points <e>", "<cs> and an army of officials to see that they are enforced <e> <s> i fundamentally disagree <e> <s> this kind of restriction is totally unnecessary nowadays <e> <s> the adult shopworkers like their fellow employees elsewhere are quite capable of deciding that kind of thing <e>", "<cs> what i can say is that from scotland we have some experience of the way the situation works <e> <s> perhaps i may develop that theme <e> <s> if it is the view of noble lords opposite that working on sunday or working at any time of the day and meeting these needs is so difficult a matter that this has to be enforced by the kind of legislation which is being suggested how is it that the system works so well in scotland <e> <s> how is it that there are those who actually prefer to work at odd times <e> <s> how is it that it has become popular not just for the normal weekdays but presumably for sundays as well <e> <s> because of course the same needs might apply there in regard to breaks and to conditions of the sort we are talking about now <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord stockton has given us a powerful example of the very important feelings which lie behind so much of his enormous experience <e> <s> he was quite right to intervene after listening to the arguments and i am sure that we are all grateful to him for expressing his views with such clarity <e>", "<cs> in responding to the noble lord lord mishcon may i say that on this particular amendment i do not in all honesty see scope for taking it away and coming back with an alternative either in principle or in detail <e> <s> what i said and the noble lord did not refer to this was that i would consider the other amendments that come forward and there are some down in the names of my noble friends which may have some scope and i shall need to listen very carefully to the arguments before i decide what can be done <e> <s> i did not rule out and this was very much the theme of the admirable speech of my noble friend lord stockton that there may be some scope in due course <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale asked for an assurance <e> <s> i should <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord oram has described this amendment would retain the provisions not only for young people but also for adults up to the age of <e> <s> the shops act makes a clear distinction between adults and young people <e> <s> i think that this is the point which the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale was making <e> <s> that act lays down more detailed employment provisions for young people <e> <s> a young person is defined as someone who is over compulsory school-leaving age but under the age of <e> <s> as i think i said in relation to the last amendment this is in line with the definition of young people in the factories act and related legislation which also contains provisions on permitted working hours of young people <e>", "<cs> i do not think that it is necessary for me to reiterate what is removed in part ii of the <e>", "<cs> what i said when we debated the earlier amendment was that i would consider carefully the arguments which were put forward on amendments subsequent to the one on which we had a division an hour or so ago <e> <s> i undertake to do precisely that <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will be able to tell as we progress through those various amendments what my inclination is <e> <s> but i stand by what i said <e> <s> i will study with great care what takes place <e> <s> if there is any news that i can give the noble lord i shall do so <e> <s> what i am not promising to do and have not promised to do at any stage is to bring good news merely to study what is said and to listen to the arguments to see precisely how we can go ahead <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord i wish merely to raise a procedural point <e> <s> does the noble lord intend to group amendment no <e> <s> with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it would be very helpful to the committee if the noble lord will indicate if that is so as i imagine it will be <e>", "<cs> if i were to help the committee i should only reinforce precisely what my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which i think is what the noble lord is referring to was not moved <e> <s> the amendment of the noble lord lord stallard can now apply only to young shopworkers over compulsory school-leaving age but below the age of <e> <s> my noble friend is correct and that puts us in a dilemma when we are considering the practicability of the amendment <e>", "<cs> once again as the noble lord lord graham has invited me to say so i have to say that the amendment tackles the sunday working provisions of section of the act <e> <s> having sought to keep the provisions giving time off in lieu of sunday working that is the theme of his argument although as he says himself he did not move that amendment the noble lord now seeks to amend the detailed application of those provisions <e> <s> it appears to be the intention to limit the time off provision to those shopworkers who have already worked at least hours during the six days before the sunday <e> <s> the amendment also removes the limit on the number of days that can be worked each month <e>", "<cs> i am just starting to develop the argument on which the noble lord has intervened <e> <s> perhaps by the time i have reached the end of it he may be a little more convinced that what we propose is not out of keeping with the circumstances in which we find ourselves today <e>", "<cs> the method by which a shopworker is compensated for working on a sunday is i suggest best left to that shopworker and his employer to sort out <e> <s> i cannot believe that this is an unreasonable suggestion <e> <s> it is precisely how millions of other people settle their affairs <e> <s> why should shopworkers i have said this on several occasions today be dealt with differently <e> <s> why should they and their employers be forced into a rigid framework that takes no account of individual circumstances <e> <s> surely individual circumstances are just as important to the noble lord and his supporters as the collective provisions that would apply if the restrictions contained in these parts of the act were to be maintained <e> <s> everywhere around us shops stay open longer than they used to do <e> <s> shopkeepers have worked out quite reasonably with the agreement of their staff how those longer hours are to be staffed <e> <s> they use shifts and rotas modelled to the flow and the volume of the trade that shop employers wish to see <e> <s> why on earth should they not be similarly inventive when it comes to sunday working <e> <s> i am convinced that there is absolutely no advantage in the law being involved in this area <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asked me particularly what consultations had taken place <e> <s> i have given him the answer to that <e> <s> we have not had a reply from the tuc yet <e> <s> if the noble lord insists upon saying that the fact that we have spoken to them and asked for their views is not consultation then i honestly do not know what is <e>", "<cs> if i may answer the second point that the noble baroness made yes i understand the whole point about fragmentation <e> <s> i said in answer to an earlier amendment that it was perfectly understandable because the unionisation of shopworkers was fragmented that that led to the kinds of difficulties which have been described from the other side of the committee this afternoon <e> <s> however the noble baroness asked who works on a sunday <e> <s> i quoted a figure of eight million of which about half worked regularly and the other half not so regularly <e> <s> there are dozens of examples <e> <s> the first and most obvious place to start is shopworkers who work illegally which this bill will put right <e> <s> but then there are service industries agriculture health workers transport manufacturers police helicopter pilots i have done it myself and all kinds of others <e>", "<cs> in answer to the earlier amendments when my noble friend lord stockton intervened with his very excellent speech i said that i would consider as i certainly shall precisely what is said in favour of the various amendments that are being put forward as this bill progresses <e> <s> we are not just dealing with part ii of the shops act there are other amendments on the marshalled list which go rather further <e> <s> i did say and i stressed it again before we broke for dinner that that did not represent a copper-bottomed guarantee to come back with something different but that every case would be <e>", "<cs> i of course shall accept that the noble baroness has a great deal of experience in her particular field <e> <s> but i ask her to also accept from research in the other direction and i gave the example of scotland and those parts of england and wales where shops are already open on sunday that shops do not seem to suffer from people not going to them because the staff are not career staff and are unable to make places work properly <e> <s> i do not believe that that is the case at all <e>", "<cs> precisely and that is why i say that it is for them to negotiate with their employers and not for this to be arranged through the statutory provisions that we are discussing <e>", "<cs> i think i can be short with this amendment <e> <s> we have here a proposal radically to alter the way in which the remaining provisions of the shops act are enforced and there lies with the amendment an implied criticism of the way in which local authorities have carried out their long-standing functions in this area <e> <s> the noble lord spoke about logicality about enforcement and the question of the auld proposals and then spoke about cost <e> <s> but the reasons for keeping the <e>", "<cs> surely the point there and the noble lord is absolutely right is that they have not enforced the law because there is no logic whatever in the law <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way but can he explain to me why it will be so necessary particularly to inspect these shops on sundays if shopping on all days of the week is totally deregulated <e> <s> can the noble lord tell me what is going to be so particularly special in this narrow sense which involves the health and safety executive as to mean that shops will have to be regularly inspected on sundays in the way he suggests <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i find the noble lords arguments most unpersuasive <e> <s> this discussion started from the whole question of the load that will be placed upon wages inspectors and centralisation of costs and administration as propounded by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> on that i have to say that it is extremely unlikely that any savings would result because wages inspectors would have to be trained in the new provisions and that would have a cost <e>", "<cs> i cannot at this very moment give a precise date as to when the review will be complete <e> <s> i said earlier that the review is under way at the moment <e> <s> i will certainly try to find out and perhaps at a convenient moment later in the proceedings or in a minute or two will let the noble lord know <e> <s> but i cannot say precisely whether or not the review will be completed at the time when the wages council legislation comes forward <e>", "<cs> the review is concerned with hours of work and not with wages as such <e> <s> the wages council legislation and the matter of hours of work for young people have some points in common in a general sense <e> <s> that review is being conducted at the moment but it deals with hours not specifically with the items to which the noble lord is referring <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has described this amendment attempts to update the existing provisions of the shops act by replacing the third schedule to the act which sets out the intervals for meals for shopworkers with a detailed schedule of the breaks that employees must be given depending on the number of hours worked <e> <s> i believe that i am right in saying that as a result of the noble lord lord graham not moving his earlier amendment we are now in rather the same position as before in respect of that amendment in that amendment no <e> <s> can now apply only to young shopworkers <e> <s> i see that the noble lord nods in assent <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has set out her amendment very reasonably indeed <e> <s> while i should be delighted if i were in a position to say that this was appropriate i am afraid i have to disappoint her again and say that i cannot say it is appropriate to the bill <e> <s> it seems that what the noble baroness is trying to achieve here is to incorporate into the shops bill provisions broadly comparable with provisions currently in wages orders issued by wages councils <e> <s> the objective seems to me to circumvent the governments proposals to reform wages councils which we have talked about earlier <e>", "<cs> the answer to the point made by the noble lord lies in the fact that there are many other workers the majority it appears from the figures which have been bandied about certainly of those who are not retail workers who come to arrangements with employers to meet the very concerns which the noble lord expresses <e> <s> we have had examples quoted very often during todays proceedings about employees who work in other areas on whatever day of the week it may be <e> <s> although ultimately of course there is recourse to law in the fact that a contract will have been entered into if employees are to be employed in shops i honestly cannot see that sensible and totally practical arrangements for the benefit of both employer and employee cannot be reached in a rather more civilised fashion than through the court although at the end of the day the court obviously exists <e>", "<cs> after the various examples that have been given perhaps i ought to declare an interest and say that i sing in the choir and so does my son <e> <s> be that as it may my noble friend lord renton has made it clear that the intention of his amendment is to extend the protection offered by the bill to new recruits if i may use the word that he used and not to confine it as the bill now does to shopworkers employed on the day before commencement of the act <e> <s> as he said the amendment would not have quite the effect that he intends because it does not amend schedule in which the proposed new rights are set out in substance <e>", "<cs> not all all <e> <s> but i go further and say that although i honestly cannot claim that it is possible instantly to redraft i understand the point that it is a complex schedule <e> <s> i do not know whether there is scope for improvements in the drafting and i take the point that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter made <e> <s> i shall see what can be done but it is very much in the hands of the parliamentary draftsman <e> <s> the provision has been worded with great care <e> <s> i should not like my noble friend to feel that i am holding out too much of an olive branch but i shall see what can be done <e>", "<cs> it might be helpful if i remind your lordships and particularly my noble friend lord campbell of alloway who has made some most helpful suggestions precisely where we got to on tuesday with the amendment standing in the name of my noble friend lord renton <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> what i said then was that i would undertake to look very carefully at all that had been said <e> <s> only one day has elapsed since then and it would be impossible to respond fully to all the suggestions that were made and the various arguments that were put forward <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord sandford and to the noble lord opposite for their suggestions <e> <s> i find myself in a rather difficult position because i cannot as i think both noble lords will appreciate commit my noble friend <e> <s> what i can say however in response to both suggestions and particularly the first suggestion is that it is something which i am sure that my noble friend will note <e> <s> as regards the second suggestion of a delegation which was made by the noble lord lord mishcon i accept the spirit in which he makes that suggestion but i think that it really needs to be considered within the overall examination of the arguments that have been put forward on the whole question of the anxiety that he expresses about those who feel they are not sufficiently protected in this field <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his suggestion and i shall react to it in due course but not now <e>", "<cs> it is part of the function of government to keep under review the needs of our society to see whether new controls are needed and whether old controls have outlived their usefulness <e> <s> it is part of this process that has led the government to bring this bill before parliament <e> <s> your lordships will know that the government keep records and statistics of all the major aspects of our daily life <e> <s> these records are kept by the different departments of state <e> <s> for example crime statistics one of the features of the noble lords amendment are produced by the home office employment statistics are produced by the department of employment information on costs and prices is produced by the department of trade and industry social trends generally are measured by the office of population censuses and surveys and matters of transport are dealt with by the department of transport <e> <s> it is from the collation of all these figures and the make-up of the information which results that government departments seek to distinguish long-term trends and to decide on future legislative needs <e>", "<cs> with respect i do not think that the noble lord can have heard some of the other arguments that were put forward if he came into the chamber only at the beginning of my speech <e> <s> the noble lord is missing the whole point <e> <s> by not being present he missed my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls asking whether if we were to accept this amendment to this bill we should amend in a similar way all the other bills which we consider <e> <s> what does the noble lord think about that <e> <s> i cannot believe that it is a sensible suggestion <e> <s> nor did i at any stage say that paragraphs <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord i really cannot accept that i laughed about anything to do with crime <e> <s> i see quite enough of the effects from other matters to do with the home office <e> <s> what i simply tried to do was to set out my answer to lord grahams amendment for which he has had some support but which some of my noble friends and others including the noble lord lord sainsbury have said does not make sense i believe for various good reasons <e>", "<cs> i may be able to satisfy the noble and learned lord lord simon <e> <s> under section of the act the occupier of premises selling refreshments may opt to apply the special provisions of section instead of the half-day holiday and meal break provisions of sections to <e> <s> if he opts for this he has to display and maintain on the premises a notice describing the special provisions and the steps taken to comply with them <e> <s> the form of the notice is prescribed by regulation <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord and to my noble friend <e> <s> it all goes to show that things are never quite so simple as one thinks <e> <s> i must tell the noble and learned lord that when he gave me notice that he intended to raise this matter i was convinced that the bill was right <e> <s> but i have listened with great care to what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> it provides me with an <e>", "<cs> i entirely appreciate the point <e> <s> i was trying to correct some information that i gave the noble and learned lord more generally on this point <e> <s> what i should like to do since this is a very complex matter is to study what the noble and learned lord has said and to write to him about it having sought the advice of those who have drafted the bill <e> <s> i think that is the only way we can take it forward <e> <s> i respect the sincerity which the noble and learned lord has expressed and his concern that we have got it wrong <e> <s> i shall do my best to examine it and explain it further <e>", "<cs> i would not dare not to send a copy to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble baroness whether she is speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> c a and a <e> <s> i believe that those are in her name <e>", "<cs> i think we all agreed at an earlier point in debating this part of the bill and parts close to it that this schedule is a very complex one <e> <s> i listened with great care to the interpretation of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale of how he understands the schedule to read if it is changed into the positive to use the same form of words as he used <e> <s> i do not think that the noble and learned lord is quite right if he suggests that the schedule gives any right to employees to be offered sunday work <e> <s> the schedule gives rights <e>", "<cs> of coure i will study what the noble and learned lord said and i am sure that he did get it right <e> <s> but it is a complex area <e> <s> if i may go on to explain what the schedule does is to give rights to workers so that they cannot be compelled against their wishes to work on sundays <e> <s> but if workers have agreed to work on sundays under a contract then they will not have the statutory rights in the schedule <e>", "<cs> now that i have listened to the noble lord lord graham and his explanation i understand what this amendment seeks to achieve but taken at its face value it will mean that existing employees who since th november wish to work on a sunday must put their agreement in writing <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord could point me to the relevant part of the shops act <e> <s> he may have that definition already to hand <e> <s> i think what lies behind it is simply a question of clarity <e> <s> i do not think there is anything more serious than that underlying it <e> <s> it may well be defined <e> <s> i shall try to find it myself <e>", "<cs> i make only a brief intervention to say that as i understand it the amendment is limited to uncontractual sunday work <e> <s> i am not quite clear in what way it amends the content of clause <e> <s> i do not believe that it does <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> i certainly agree that this matter is exceedingly complex <e> <s> sometimes i wish i were a lawyer sometimes i am glad i am not <e> <s> however i can say that i still find myself floundering on issues such as this <e> <s> i shall study what has been said with great care and perhaps i may write to all those noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e>", "<cs> i listened with care to the noble lord lord graham but if these amendments were to be passed they would give one party to a contractual arrangement <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether my noble friend was in her place when the earlier amendments were discussed which made clear that on various points concerned with employment notably on amendment no <e> <s> put down earlier by my noble friend lord renton and debated again this afternoon on clause stand part i had indicated that there may be food for thought in what my noble friend lord renton had said <e> <s> i think that what my noble friend lady gardner is suggesting would perhaps be encompassed within those remarks <e> <s> it may not necessarily mean that this particular amendment is suitable for ideas of the sort she is putting forward <e> <s> nevertheless i did give an undertaking to consider very seriously and with great care all the remarks that were made in connection with earlier amendments which might meet my noble friends point <e>", "<cs> i have listened with care to the views that have been expressed both by my noble friend lord brentford and just now by the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> when he introduced the amendment my noble friend went some way towards indicating that the arguments on drawing the line if that is the right turn of phrase to use between those who would have been employed before the time the act comes into force and those who would be employed subsequently had been debated at some length in the broadest terms on tuesday and that i had then made quite clear to the committee that i proposed to examine with the very greatest care all the arguments that had been deployed <e> <s> i can if the committee feels it appropriate rehearse some of the arguments that i deployed then again tonight <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will realise that the undertaking i have given to examine carefully the points that were made was made in good faith and that i think the point he is trying to make is very close not identical because it comes in a different part of the bill to the point which was made by my noble friend lord renton <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> that again fits in with the whole question of the drafting of the schedule which i have said i shall look at to see whether or not it can be simplified <e> <s> i do not know yet precisely how it can be but i have given that undertaking <e> <s> i am reluctant to embark upon a long debate setting out the reasons that i rehearsed before <e> <s> i hope the committee will accept <e>", "<cs> i listened with care to the comments of the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs and to the remarks made earlier by the noble baroness lady seear concerning women who may need jobs to fit in with the circumstances that surround their families <e> <s> what i say in connection with this amendment will not detract in any sense from my understanding of the general proposal that the noble baroness makes <e>", "<cs> i hope that this amendment similarly will be withdrawn <e> <s> i share the view of the noble and learned lord that the earlier amendment was perhaps the better of the two if there was any preference to be accepted <e>", "<cs> it is true to say that in many walks of life and not just in shops circumstances change and it is possible for a business to want to alter its <e>", "<cs> i take the point that the noble baroness is making but i do not understand in that case why there should be such a difference between those in the retail trade and employees elsewhere who <e>", "<cs> may i clarify one point for my noble friend lady gardner of parkes concerning the trials which was the point in which she was interested <e> <s> there is no reason why the employer and the employee should not agree in the contract for a trial of say three months or whatever <e> <s> there is nothing to stand in the way of that <e>", "<cs> this amendment would require an industrial tribunal which has found a dismissal to be unfair under paragraph to make an order that the employee be reinstated in accordance with sections and of the employment protection consolidation act <e>", "<cs> the memory of the noble baroness is much longer than mine <e> <s> i do not know the answer to her question but perhaps i can let her know in due course <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment which i think he is about to do let me say to the noble baroness lady seear that i believe that she is right <e> <s> if a tribunal orders reinstatement but the employer disobeys the order an additional award will be made <e>", "<cs> the amendment is intended to prevent established shopworkers over retirement age from making a claim for unfair dismissal if dismissed for refusing sunday work <e> <s> my noble friend has been good enough to say that it is a probing amendment <e> <s> i shall endeavour to explain where a misconception in <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly consider the views of my noble friend messages arrive with great speed in your lordships house <e> <s> i understand that compensation is made up of two elements a basic award which is not payable if the employee is over retirement age and a compensatory award which is payable in all cases <e> <s> perhaps i can expand on that point to my noble friend in writing <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale is quite right <e> <s> section which prevents contracting out of the statutory rights applies to the rights in the schedule <e> <s> all that the present paragraph does is to ensure that an employee can enter into a contractual agreement to do sunday work <e> <s> however the purpose of the amendment would certainly be to prevent established shopworkers from waiving their statutory rights and voluntarily agreeing to work on a sunday <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly look at the debate in <e>", "<cs> it was with great interest that i heard the last remarks of the noble baroness lady seear about the difficulty of persuading people to come into work on a sunday <e>", "<cs> yes or even a monday <e> <s> but the fact is that at the moment so far as i understand it there is no great evidence to suggest that there is difficulty in finding staff to carry out the work on either the monday or the sunday <e> <s> be that as it may despite the fact that sunday work appears to be popular the noble baronesss point is directly concerned with section of the act which provides that shopworkers are given time off in lieu if they work on sundays <e> <s> perhaps to avoid confusion i could first of all explain that the bill as drafted retains these provisions for young people at the same time as lifting them for adult shopworkers <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness may have misunderstood me <e> <s> what i was suggesting was that it was perfectly reasonable to expect individuals to come to arrangements with their employers within their contracts on this whole substance <e> <s> i do not see any particular reason why the retail trade should be so different in the way the noble baroness suggests <e> <s> i am not suggesting that we are going as far as the noble baroness suggests <e> <s> what i can say is that the government propose to remove restrictions on womens hours of work in a sex discrimination bill <e> <s> i do not think that goes quite as far as the noble baroness feels i am going here <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether perhaps the noble baroness and i are talking at cross-purposes <e> <s> what i am saying here is that as things stand the act provides that workers in shops are given time off in lieu on that i think we are agreed and that as the bill is drafted provisions for young people will remain the same and they will be lifted for adult shopworkers <e> <s> i then went on to say that the abolition of restriction on hours of work for adults and the removal of restrictions on trading hours will mean that for the majority of employees in this country conditions of employment and those i think are the key words will be decided by collective or individual bargaining <e> <s> is the noble baroness saying that individual bargaining in other industries does not take place <e>", "<cs> i have listened with care to what was said by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale and my noble friend lord renton on the matter of the drafting of schedule <e> <s> i do not in any sense dodge my responsibilities because my name appears on the front of the bill <e> <s> when i said at col of <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for the enormous help he has been in seeking to speed the progress of the bill so far <e> <s> however we have other stages to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the noble lords interest in this point <e> <s> i can say that while the guidance given should assist uniformity of application the fixed penalty is one of several procedures available to the police to deal with relevant breaches of the law and the decision as to which course of action to take in particular circumstances is a matter for the chief officer of police <e> <s> of course discussions continue in various fora about this but i note the noble lords concern <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may answer the noble baroness so far as the first part of her supplementary question is concerned no <e> <s> i can tell her that we received one of the comments only a matter of two or three days before i wrote to the noble baroness <e> <s> if the noble baroness would like to ask a written question then i shall certainly provide all the information in the form of a written answer <e>", "<cs> my lords if i refer the noble lord to the exchange which took place on th november about anti-competitive practices and the publishing of <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question which goes wide of that on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord airedale said once again we confront this question of the use of codes of practice in evidence <e> <s> at report stage we had a very useful discussion on this matter arising from an amendment proposed as he said by the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> during that discussion the noble lord lord airedale referred to the detailed debate on the subject of codes of practice initiated by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> that debate had taken place on the preceding day th january and i said that i would examine this matter again in the light of that debate <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is what i hope we shall be able to achieve but what we have to look at clearly is precisely how we draft an amendment to meet the concern which has been expressed by the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> i think the concern of my noble friend will be met <e> <s> the code will be laid before parliament clause refers to that <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend is satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment raises at third reading an issue which has not been considered before during our discussion on this bill <e> <s> i understand the concern of the noble lord lord airedale to ensure that the provisions of the bill concerning the issue of a search warrant should adequately cover all the circumstances in which the issue of a warrant might be appropriate <e> <s> however this is a technical matter and one which requires some quite detailed consideration <e> <s> it has not been raised before and i should therefore like to have the opportunity to examine it and come to a considered opinion <e> <s> i shall then write to the noble lord <e> <s> i hope that this suggested course will be acceptable to him and that in the light of this he will see fit to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords our discussions today have completed our detailed consideration of the entirety of this bill although as has been forecast by those of your lordships who have just spoken in due course we may examine any amendments made to it in another place and we have been given some indication of what sort of amendments there might be <e> <s> the bill introduces the first legislative changes for years to the system of controlling experimental work carried out on living animals <e> <s> this is an historic and notable development <e> <s> we have had to look back at the vast changes in the biological sciences which have taken place since our parliamentary predecessors debated the cruelty to animals act and we have had to look forward to the developments in science which are yet to come and which the new system of control must be able to encompass <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that there are a variety of results <e> <s> consistency of approach in sentencing is something to be aimed for but that will not necessarily produce uniformity of results <e> <s> magistrates must be free to reflect their knowledge of local concerns and problems <e> <s> that is a major virtue of a locally-based system <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is right <e> <s> i must stress also that ministers have often reaffirmed that the government favour the use of non-custodial sentences wherever possible <e> <s> we have done so in addressing magistrates for example <e> <s> we also foster the exchange of sentencing information among magistrates <e> <s> but quite properly and as i said earlier the role of the government must be to advise and encourage rather than to direct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the magistrates courts will absorb the advice that is contained in that document <e> <s> the analysis that led to the question in the first place deals with sentencing for all indictable offences which is much too large a category from which to draw clear conclusions about sentencing practice <e> <s> as i indicated earlier total uniformity is not the aim <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that that supplementary question goes very wide of the original question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i think she has put her finger on a most important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already indicated that we take steps wherever possible in addressing magistrates and so on to reaffirm the use of non-custodial sentences <e> <s> the first part of the noble lords supplementary question goes rather wider than the subject of custodial sentences <e>", "<cs> my lords i note my noble friends remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the home office studies figures such as the noble lord produced and i am glad that he welcomes the new publication <e> <s> however as i indicated the analysis which produced the figures to which he refers deals with sentencing for all indictable offences so it goes rather wider than the narrow area we are considering <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble and learned lord that there is one mistake and that occurs at the top of page where it says after clause <e> <s> it certainly should read after clause <e> <s> as regards amendment no <e> <s> which in the view of the noble and learned lord should come after clause and amendment no <e> <s> which in his view ought to come after clause i cannot give an answer immediately but i shall endeavour to let the noble and learned lord know shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his observations <e> <s> indeed he was kind <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill before us as my noble friend lord onslow has reminded us removes the statutory restrictions from retail trading hours <e> <s> it does so in recognition of the strong demand that exists and i shall return to lord grahams points and those of the noble lord lord mishcon about representations in a moment and which has consistently been revealed in surveys of public opinion and is regularly exhibited today now in peoples shopping habits <e> <s> the bill recognises the fact that trading outside the hours currently permitted in the legislation is already happening <e> <s> shopkeepers want to open their shops shoppers want to shop and the government do not believe that they should prevent these activities which after all are perfectly harmless activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to recognise after this long debate that some of your lordships find it an attractive proposition that the regulation of retail trading hours particularly on a sunday should be in the hands of local authorities in order that they can be tailored to the needs of local communities <e> <s> that has come over quite plainly <e> <s> but i rather hope that on reflection your lordships will see that such a scheme would introduce a quite intolerable burden of bureaucracy as we have heard from so many who have spoken this afternoon <e> <s> this burden would fall on traders it would fall on courts and it would fall on the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord continues i wonder whether he would be happy to follow the course that i believe was agreed earlier that with this amendment we should take amendments nos <e> <s> and because they are all on much the same theme <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i have listened with great care to the noble and learned lord lord denning and to those others of your lordships who have supported him in this amendment <e> <s> but as i have said consistently i believe during the passage of this bill it is the governments view that the employment restrictions in the act are outdated and they are unnecessary <e> <s> to that extent i have to disagree with a lot of what has been said on this amendment <e> <s> there really is no logical reason to my mind why meal breaks half holidays and sunday working arrangements for adult shopworkers should be decided by parliament when it is not thought necessary to do so for other groups of workers <e> <s> surely matters like this are for individual or collective bargaining <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognised that point before and i shall come to it again in due course as i proceed to explain my amendment no <e> <s> in a few moments <e> <s> i realise that shopworkers are not so well represented as other types of worker but i cannot believe that in principle the individual and at the end of the day we are talking about individuals let alone the collective bargaining side will not be able to come <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall endeavour to explain to the noble lord in a moment <e> <s> may i before i finish explaining the reasons for this amendment say that i recognise the force of the arguments expressed in committee on this matter <e> <s> i cannot go so far as the noble and learned lord lord denning and others would like me to and i have spelt out the reasons why <e> <s> i believe that those reasons stand scrutiny <e> <s> but what we have by my amendment is a means of meeting the understandable concern about the transitional period <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to join the noble lord in that <e> <s> if i can spell it out more clearly in due course i shall do so <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i am too <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i simply say that i shall of course look at <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down may i respond briefly to what was said by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> i feel that he somewhat exaggerated the state of play <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather thought that i had the right to do so but with the leave of the house and before the noble and learned lord moves the amendment finally may i simply answer the point made by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> i said that i believed he had exaggerated rather wildly about the response of the government to what had been said at report <e> <s> it is very difficult to know how we could have responded any earlier to it because we had not heard either the argument of the noble lord lord mccarthy or indeed the argument of the noble lord lord mishcon or indeed the point which had been raised by my noble friend lord stockton my noble friend lord sandford and others <e> <s> that is precisely why we realised that there was force in the argument that there could be confusion and could be difficulties as the auld report itself made clear in a paragraph which was quoted by the noble and learned lord lord denning earlier this afternoon and that the idea of a transitional period would remove that concern or would go a very long way towards easing it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham says that there is no evidence <e> <s> there is evidence to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposals in that bill which is already in another place are aimed at giving young people a chance at employment <e> <s> noble lords opposite are the first people to suggest that not enough has been done for employment and they are the first also to suggest that the people on whom we should concentrate are those who are young <e> <s> that is precisely what that bill seeks to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the last thing i would want to do is to upset the procedure of your lordships house <e> <s> if i have stepped out of order i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason for offering safeguards to existing employees as we propose is clear and furthermore it is straighforward <e> <s> the bill will radically alter the position of existing shopworkers many of whom may have been attracted to shop work in the first instance because they would not have to work on a sunday <e> <s> i understand the concern of existing shopworkers and i believe that our proposals recognise their special position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> what this amendment would do i believe is to leave us with two sets of provisions the best solution i feel in the light of the amendment of the noble and learned lord lord denning having been carried is for us to go away and reflect upon the implications of that upon what is contained in this amendment and also amendment no <e> <s> d <e> <s> otherwise we might get ourselves into a dreadful muddle <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i take note of what the noble lord lord mishcon says <e> <s> i shall look at the amendment and at exactly what has transpired <e> <s> i undertake certainly to let all those who are interested know precisely what our thinking is if that satisfies the noble lord <e> <s> that will be done as soon as possible in the course of the next few days perhaps by the weekend or at least as soon as we have been able to work it out <e> <s> on the question of amendment no <e> <s> raised by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale i agree that i shall not be moving that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house once more i understand that there is no question before the house at the moment <e> <s> i am not sure therefore that we are not straying from our rules of order <e> <s> the best solution i would suggest in the light of the fact that there are one or two amendments which may have some relevance is that we take them as they come and that as we approach the magic time of we shall see precisely where we are then <e>", "<cs> my lords as i promised we would during the committee stage we have carefully considered all the arguments put forward by your lordships during that stage that these two new rights should be extended to employees entering the industry after commencement date <e> <s> after a very careful consideration however of the arguments we have decided that it would not be appropriate to give new entrants these rights <e> <s> we have however been able to make a small concession to extend these rights to existing employees who subsequently change employers <e> <s> i will discuss that in detail when i move my amendment to schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has described the purpose of his amendment and indeed i did offer to write to him <e> <s> i did so and i received the noble and learned lords further thoughts on the subject just before the start of the report stage last thursday <e> <s> since then i have been giving further consideration to the points raised and i can say now there is a measure of common ground between us <e> <s> however there are still several matters i should like to <e>", "<cs> my lords the short answer to the noble lord lord graham is that everyone does enjoy that which he seeks <e> <s> i could explain at some length having expected the noble lord lord mccarthy to move amendments nos <e> <s> a and b <e> <s> i would have been able to explain that what he proposed was unnecessary because paragraph already achieves the intention of the amendments <e> <s> it is not necessary to disapply the rules in schedule as to what counts as a period of continuous employment <e> <s> there may be a misunderstanding on this <e> <s> i hope that the noble lords lord mccarthy and lord graham will accept what i have said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely conscious perhaps more conscious than some others that on matters of employment legislation the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton and the noble lord lord mccarthy are renowned experts <e> <s> i very much remember my indoctrination on the employment bill i believe it was when we debated for long hours as far as oclock in the morning at one point some fairly difficult concepts <e> <s> may i assure the noble lord lord wedderburn that there is no intention to indicate a change of policy by what has been put now in new paragraph <e> <s> it is certainly not the intention that agreements made with people other than employers are covered by paragraph <e> <s> it is intended that only legally-binding agreements are covered by that paragraph <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will remember as i am sure he will that it must be said that any agreement between an employer and an employee will form part of the contract of employment <e> <s> i believe he will concede that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house what i am saying is that i shall have to study very carefully what has been said <e> <s> i honestly do not think i can respond off the top of my head to the very detailed and technical arguments which have been put forward by the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton <e> <s> i shall study that and i shall undertake certainly to correspond with all those who have taken part in this debate with a view to clarifying the position <e> <s> it is conceivable that something has not been spelt out correctly <e> <s> i should like to consider what has been said and i hope the noble lord will agree that that is the best way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to this debate with great care and great interest <e> <s> i agree entirely with the noble lord lord mishcon when he said words to the effect that a topic such as this is of great concern to all of us <e> <s> of course it is <e> <s> nobody can be in any doubt about that having listened to what has been said <e> <s> i have to say also that there are no easy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord gives expression to his ignorance of the facts in the case of the london bombing at the rubens hotel <e>", "<cs> my lords i humbly apologise to both noble lords i wrote down one name on one piece of paper and then put down the wrong name on the next piece of paper <e> <s> of course it was the noble lord lord mishcon and he was quite right <e> <s> there is a mistake <e> <s> the text does not tally with the chart <e> <s> in northern ireland no exclusion orders were made in <e> <s> i apologise for this i will make sure that it is corrected in any other version <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that sir cyril would not have made that suggestion lightly <e> <s> i will certainly look at it and perhaps correspond with the noble lord and explain more fully in writing <e> <s> the noble lord lord wigoder raised the question of tape recording <e> <s> while it is clearly desirable that a person detained under this act should so far as possible enjoy the same safeguards as anyone else in police custody there are a number of particular difficulties <e> <s> for example a copy of the recorded tape is given to the defence <e> <s> there is provision for it to be edited to remove sensitive material but even an edited tape would suggest the extent of a terrorists co-operation with the police and could lay him open to reprisals from his colleagues <e> <s> there is a clear risk of deterring confessions and the giving of incriminating information <e>", "<cs> my lords i will come to that in my next answer <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned the fact that no applications for extension of detention or exclusion were referred by the secretary of state in great britain <e> <s> arrangements have been made by the police in england and wales to channel applications for extended detention through a unit in new scotland yard <e> <s> that procedure acts as a preliminary sift and i think that may to some extent explain the phenomenon but in any case extensions and exclusions most certainly are not rubber-stamped in any way at all <e> <s> as it happens my right honourable friend the home secretary has already this year refused two exclusion applications which were connected that is in <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely accept the noble lords point of view <e> <s> it is a little difficult to get into the realms of particular cases <e> <s> but may i pursue that further and correspond with him <e> <s> i note the point that he made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that sir cyril will look at the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought it might be useful if i intervened briefly <e> <s> i think the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale is not <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether i hold the same edition in my hand as the noble and learned lord has but in my hook it is on page <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the eighth day upon which we have debated a bill which affects an activity undertaken by virtually every member of society <e> <s> it is hardly surprising that so much interest has been and is being shown in it <e> <s> nor is it surprising that there have been so many lobbies representing various interest groups <e> <s> we must remember however that this bill is of direct interest to all members of society so we must look beyond those lobbies to the views of society as a whole and not be unduly influenced by any one minority interest of society <e>", "<cs> my lords officials have now written to those authorities which have failed to submit plans as requested making it clear that my right honourable friend the secretary of state now requires copies of their plans and that if they are not forthcoming we will consider withholding civil defence grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i gave the answer to that just now to my noble friend when i said that my right honourable friend could require the withholding of civil defence grant <e> <s> it is important that we have as full information as possible about the state of preparedness throughout the country <e> <s> the government are determined to ensure that all local authorities meet their obligations under the regulations and we shall take whatever steps are necessary to achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is important to complete the assessment first <e> <s> we will bear in mind the concerns that have been expressed this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords it applies to all authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords we will all be grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> lord harris of greenwich for having initiated a debate on such an important subject <e> <s> the debate has been wide-ranging and interesting and there have been many thoughtful contributions <e> <s> i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot explain the mechanism to my noble friend in a moment or two but i shall certainly let him know what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately in the time allowed i cannot cover that point as fully as i should like but i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i am aware of the numbers of volunteers who come forward for this training <e> <s> the principal burden of volunteer training falls mainly on the experienced emergency planning staff of local authorities <e> <s> the programmes which we encourage include community advisers communications rescue scientific adviser and first-aid training <e> <s> several training exercises and exercise activities are carried out in conjunction with the voluntary aid societies as well <e> <s> additionally there are places on suitable courses at the civil defence college which are offered on general and specialist courses to volunteers with appropriate experience <e>", "<cs> my lords the important point is that the civil defence general local authority functions regulations require counties and all those others concerned to undertake recruitment organisation and training <e> <s> i am sure there are many ways in which voluntary organisations can help in every area <e>", "<cs> my lords whether they declare themselves nuclear-free zones or not does not mean they do not have to comply with the civil defence regulations which i have just mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked a number of questions <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lord rentons main point or one of his points was the use that can be made of the resources that are used now for civil defence work for peacetime emergencies <e> <s> i hope that the bill which is in another place at the moment will encourage authorities to adopt a flexible approach to the use of all their civil defence resources including the networks of volunteers which many of them are successfully building up <e> <s> i have seen them at work at first hand myself <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> it is also important for all of us to realise that if we did in fact tragically end up in a nuclear war there are many millions who would survive it and that is why it is important to have these civil defence plans in effect <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting point <e> <s> i do not know the answer to that question but i will find out and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> not that i know of in quite that form my lords <e> <s> however the noble lord will be aware that in another place there is a bill in passage at the moment which seeks to provide a statutory basis for the use of local authorities civil defence resources in responding to and planning for peacetime emergencies <e> <s> so many of those who take part in the kinds of exercises in which i know my noble friend lord renton has a great interest include vast numbers of volunteers and they make a splendid effort <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have with me information about what precisely those difficulties are but i will certainly look into the point raised by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks a number of questions <e> <s> if i may just take his last example he will understand that it is not for me in this house to answer for the alleged activities of any other country <e> <s> the important point is that we all deplore terrorism wherever it occurs <e> <s> there are a considerable number of international fora to exchange information and to try to prevent terrorism and they deserve the full support of all of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that every aspect of international terrorism needs studying but the important thing is to prevent it <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord i think that that question is considerably wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the best service that the noble lord could perform for all those who do their best to combat terrorism is to give their efforts his unflinching support <e>", "<cs> my lords in my original answer i said that there was no internationally accepted definition of terrorism <e> <s> what i gave is the definition that is adopted in this country <e> <s> if the noble lord reads what i said in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the scourge of drugs misuse inflicting as it does incalculable misery and a tragic waste of young lives is one of the most serious problems facing our society <e> <s> that it is a matter of deep concern to all members of your lordships house has been amply demonstrated may times <e> <s> it is not however a problem which lends itself to quick and simple solutions <e> <s> if a real impact is to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i used the words significantly below its true value <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an interesting and useful debate <e> <s> two things have emerged clearly from all the speeches <e> <s> first there is concern on all sides of the house about the problems of drug misuse and towards the end of the debate my noble friends lady macleod and lord rodney dwelt on that <e> <s> secondly there is the determination of your lordships to support whatever steps can reasonably be set in hand to tackle the problem <e> <s> we all seem to be agreed on the need for urgent and effective action on all aspects of drug misuse and an essential part of that strategy is a comprehensive attack on those who engage in the illegal trafficking of drugs <e>", "<cs> in that case my lords perhaps i may say that the customs is concentrating in a big way on detecting drug smuggling <e> <s> it is a top priority <e> <s> increasing emphasis is being placed on the use of risk assessment intelligence and information as he suggested both in supplying routine controls and in carrying out special exercises <e> <s> since we have more than doubled the number of specialist drug investigators <e> <s> i could go on but i shall let the noble lord have further information in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly study that point with great care <e> <s> as to clause and serious arrestable offences to which the noble lord lord hooson also referred that clause provides that most drug trafficking offences are to be regarded as serious offences for the purposes of the police and criminal evidence act <e> <s> the act contains certain special powers that are available only in relation to the investigation of serious arrestable offences <e> <s> the purpose of clause is to ensure for the avoidance of doubt that these powers are always available in drugs cases <e> <s> in fact many drug trafficking offences would already be brought within the definition of serious arrestable offences as i am sure the noble lord will appreciate by reason of the likelihood that they will result in substantial financial gain <e> <s> here i am referring of course to section of the police and criminal evidence act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> that is a point upon which i was about to comment <e> <s> i realise the force of the noble lords argument <e> <s> the whole question of reversing the burden of proof in this instance is important and goes slightly wider perhaps than lord mishcons comments <e> <s> i recognise the noble lords concern about the issue to which he has again referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for making those useful points <e> <s> she is quite right <e> <s> as she says there are two units one at hendon and one at brentford and a further six units are planned <e> <s> as regards the question of interviews my noble friend is quite right and hopefully this will result in more cases being reported <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the police are taking all the steps they possibly can to reduce the incidence of rape <e> <s> my noble friend lady macleod asked about special arrangements for the examination of women <e> <s> as she said there are those two centres which will be followed by another six <e> <s> i entirely share the noble lords concern and that is why every possible step is being taken to try to reduce the incidence of this dreadful crime <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a most interesting suggestion <e> <s> so far as i know it is not the case at present and reliance is placed merely on reporting restrictions <e> <s> but i shall certainly convey the noble lords point of view to those others concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this applies to other cases and not just to rape as my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i am sure my lords that the local authorities concerned will take whatever steps they see fit to protect people <e> <s> if their lighting is inadequate they will make arrangements for it to be improved <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble baroness that all those who are involved in this matter at the home office take it very seriously and consider it in the light of all the different aspects of the departments which are concerned with it <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly rape crisis centres seem to be the sort of centres which could usefully promote my noble friends point of view <e> <s> i am sure that they will take note of what she says <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of the case to which the noble lord refers and i understand that the press council is holding an inquiry into the publication of a photograph of an alleged rape victim in yesterdays <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the interest of the noble lord and his party in this matter <e> <s> we hope that agreement can be reached but it is not for us to take any initiative while the matter is still with the european parliament for it to make its proposals <e> <s> we shall become actively involved if proposals are put by the parliament to the council of ministers <e> <s> so far as dates are concerned we estimate that agreement would have to be reached in time for the necessary legislation to be introduced in the session of parliament in order to have the effect the noble lord would like <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with the noble lord as no doubt he would expect <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter would also agree since i believe i heard assenting noises from my right <e>", "<cs> yes my lords particularly if it gets universal agreement <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of the fact that there are differences of view on this side of the house as well <e> <s> i am also aware of the fact that european elections are somewhat different <e> <s> what i think is essential is that there is uniform agreement in europe for the adoption of any proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that explanation of the reasons behind his amendment <e> <s> i fear that he is going to be a little <e>", "<cs> i have listened with care to what has been said and i have noted the dissenting opinions of the two noble and learned lords on the cross-benches on this issue <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning picked up the point that i made at the end of my initial remarks that this is very much a matter for the discretion of the high court taking into account the circumstances of any case <e> <s> i would have thought that that could cover the point made by the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies i would have thought that it could do so but i cannot be absolutely certain without verifying the fact <e> <s> nevertheless it is an important point <e>", "<cs> i may tell both noble lords that i can accept the amendment but with one proviso <e> <s> the noble lord will remember that i mentioned on second reading that it was our intention to replace clause with new provisions that will specify in some detail the procedures by which the bill will be enforced in scotland <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord denning for his explanation of the <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble lord lord harris i can most certainly confirm that there is no question of not being able to come back to this matter at some future stage <e> <s> the aims of the bill which have received universal praise in your lordships house lead us against what the noble lord lord mishcon has described as fairly fundamental principles of law or words to that effect <e> <s> so there is a difficult balance to be struck <e> <s> there is no difficulty in taking on board the point made by the noble lord lord shepherd about the wider means of moving currency around <e> <s> i shall make sure that his remarks are taken into account <e>", "<cs> certainly i can give that assurance in respect of reasonable grounds for suspicion <e> <s> i thought that i had done so in answer to the point made by the noble and learned lord lord wheatley <e> <s> as for rank i shall certainly also consider that <e> <s> i am sorry i forgot to mention it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on evelyn glenholmes being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their comments on this serious matter and i shall endeavour to answer the points which have been raised by them <e> <s> the fact is that to a very large extent we are concerned with technical matters when it comes to the issuing of warrants and i can assure both noble lords that in the opinion of those concerned here the greatest care had been taken over the question of the deposition the statement of facts that was attached to the warrants <e> <s> it was our view that the date on the deposition could precede that on the warrants which it did <e> <s> the original deposition the statement of facts was on th october and the warrants themselves referred to th november <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me i shall endeavour to return to that point in a moment <e> <s> the point which i was answering and about which the noble lord asked me was when we learned that things were not in order <e> <s> i told the noble lord just now that we heard on friday and that a senior lawyer from the dpps office was sent to dublin immediately <e> <s> as for the suggestion that a magistrate or some other person should have gone to dublin i have to say that it is not certain that that would have affected the outcome in any way at all <e>", "<cs> no my lords apparently they do not include a misspelling of the defendants name that information is not correct <e> <s> we understand that the errors were matters of technical terminology nothing greater nor less than that <e> <s> for example the term the central criminal court london or words to that effect were used in the warrants and it was felt by the irish authorities that they should have referred to the central criminal court england and wales <e> <s> those were the minor points upon which the irish authorities based their rejection of those warrants <e> <s> i can reassure the noble lord again by saying that so far as i am aware there is no question of the name being spelled wrongly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his comments <e> <s> i agree with him that extradition is crucial <e> <s> i do not feel as he will not that the anglo-irish agreement is in any sense worthless <e> <s> on the contrary i think that the incident underlines the need for a forum such as the inter-governmental conference within which matters of mutual concern can be discussed and article of the agreement provides that the conference shall be concerned with legal matters including policy aspects of extradition <e> <s> i can say that officials are already undertaking work on this extremely important area <e> <s> the fact that it is crucial is one reason why it should be and is being undertaken by the inter-governmental conference <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply say to my noble friend that nobody for one single moment underestimates the significance of this matter <e> <s> i can also assure him that those who set out to perform the task that they were given based upon the warrants which were issued in would have done so only on the perfectly clear advice that the interpretation of the law that was made was the correct interpretation <e> <s> that is what was done <e> <s> the fact that things have come to pass which show that now there is scope for tightening up is a matter to which i referred when i read the statement <e> <s> no doubt the point that my noble friend makes will be considered as will all the other points that have been raised in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said in answer to the noble lord lord fitt was that the incident underlines the need for a forum such as the inter-governmental conference because matters like this can be taken into account <e> <s> what i certainly cannot do because it would be entirely wrong for me to do so is to comment on the decision of the irish courts and i am sure that the noble lord will understand that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that observation <e> <s> as he is aware that is not the view taken by those who looked at this document in ireland <e> <s> i can go no further than to tell my noble friend that the interpretation placed upon the warrant was that it should have related to england and wales <e> <s> i can say no more <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> what i said was that i would pass on the concern that had been expressed by the noble lord lord mishcon that there ought to be some sort of inquiry <e> <s> i went on to say that i did not necessarily feel that my right honourable friend would be able to agree to that because most of the facts had been deduced already as i think the noble lord lord donaldson will appreciate <e> <s> lessons will have been learnt they always are from these things and i very much regret that this arose <e> <s> but i stress to the noble lord that one or more of the reasons for the issue to have arisen was very much the point that my noble friend lord renton raised <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that they are related <e> <s> the question that the noble lord lord mishcon asked me was precisely what were the errors contained in the warrants and i gave him an example of what those errors were <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton did not agree that the judgment made upon the warrant was the correct judgment and he pointed out that so far as he was concerned that court was in london and should not have been referred to as england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall look into the matter <e> <s> i cannot tell the noble lord here and now whether it will be possible to produce that list <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that is that this is a judgment made by the irish authorities and it may not be possible to do so <e> <s> i shall endeavour to do so but i cannot promise standing at this box to guaranteee that it will be possible <e> <s> what i can guarantee to do if it is not possible to produce a list is to explain fully why not <e>", "<cs> i note the noble lords point of view my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say to the noble lord is that in conjunction with the request that the noble lord lord mishcon made that i draw those views to the attention of my right honourable friend the home secretary that i shall do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the facts have largely been adduced <e> <s> i am not sure that it would serve any useful purpose to produce a more detailed statement because what has been said is already detailed and explains what has happened <e> <s> nevertheless i am sure that my right honourable friend will note the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> i recall that the noble lord lord harris of greenwich raised this issue during the debate at second reading and the noble and learned lord lord denning has now joined him in pressing this point <e> <s> i fully recognise the force of the point of view of the noble lord lord harris that concern about drugs is increasing <e> <s> the noble lord has quoted some statistics today which add weight to his words <e> <s> my noble friend lord boardman agreed with him too on that point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the two noble lords and the noble and learned lord for their comments <e> <s> i entirely share their sentiments about the retail consortium <e> <s> it is a responsible attitude to take and i am glad that it has been able to approve of what we are doing <e>", "<cs> that is certainly a matter upon which i shall need to reflect and seek advice <e> <s> i undertake to do precisely that <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly do my best to provide helpful advice before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords about per cent <e> <s> of the cases are resolved in a year or so but the rising volume of applications to the board over a number of years has substantially increased the boards workload <e> <s> however this is a matter which is continually kept under review as i indicated in the original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords in some cases yes interim payments are awarded <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of applications received in was <e> <s> that was higher than in any previous year and more than in <e> <s> the number of cases in progress therefore has increased by nearly so the number actually in delay at various stages is about <e>", "<cs> my lords in the boards staff complement was increased by that is from to and a further increase of staff has recently been agreed <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary is aware of the difficulties and is considering whether it is possible to provide further increases of staff <e> <s> so far as concerns finance for great britain as a whole provision has been made for million compensation and million worth of administration expenditure <e> <s> this will allow for an increase in staff and in compensation in the terms that i gave <e> <s> i can give further figures about the overall expenditure if the noble lord would like to have them <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the views of the noble lord and the sympathy which he has expressed for those who were injured as a result of the brighton bomb outrage but it is the boards established practice not to make awards while related criminal proceedings are pending <e> <s> even in cases which are apparently as <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble baroness the number of disciplinary incidents that have taken place but i shall find out and let her know <e> <s> as to the mixing of the younger with the older elements in styal this is a matter in which the new governor is taking a keen interest as did the old <e> <s> matters are not unsatisfactory but they will be kept under review <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree certainly with the noble lord that the statements that appeared in the press were totally inaccurate in that respect <e> <s> there was no evidence of any pressure applied by the prison officers association to move or to seek to move the then governor of styal <e> <s> so far as night-manning levels are concerned this is a matter that the present governor is looking at with the northern regional director <e> <s> it will be closely looked at over the coming months <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have just said there is no truth in the reports in the press that there have been the difficulties at styal that some people think have arisen <e> <s> it has been a gross misrepresentation <e> <s> but the regional director will be keeping a close eye on the establishment <e> <s> he has asked the new governor to pay particular attention to those areas about which allegations have been made and should it prove necessary to take corrective action <e> <s> it is not necessary i believe to institute a formal inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that question goes very wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> however i can tell the noble lord that the whole question of the female prison system is currently being looked at by ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords bullying is unfortunately something that does occur in a number of different establishments not just female establishments <e> <s> it is a matter of concern to all those involved in prison life that this in fact happens <e> <s> appropriate steps will be taken to lessen it where this can be done <e> <s> so far as the letter is concerned i shall certainly look into this and inquire as to when the reply will be forthcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to interrupt the noble lord when he has spoken for some considerable time in moving his case but he is referring in great detail to the noble and learned lord the lord chief justice who is of course not here to respond in any way to what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> i shall return to this theme no doubt when i wind up but i hope that the noble lord realises he has made some fairly serious allegations on different aspects of public life and about people who are not able to defend themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord paget has given us an opportunity to debate a very serious and important matter <e> <s> it is one which arouses strong feelings both about the principles of justice and about the role of the media in contemporary life <e>", "<cs> my lords i said to the noble lord that i understood from press reports that it was to appear in the future <e> <s> the noble lord may have seen them as well <e> <s> i was going on to say that the government never have questioned and so far as i am concerned never will question the right of this programme or of any other journalist to dig as deeply as he can to uncover miscarriages in our criminal justice system <e> <s> the government share a view expressed by the noble and learned lord lord lane in the course of delivering judgment in mr mycocks case and indeed the noble and learned lord lord denning has said much the same thing that no one could complain about any attempt to right injustice and the sooner errors which are bound to occur from time to time in the judicial system are remedied the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i too read that letter and it is a matter of judgment just how disinterested was the person who wrote the letter <e> <s> however rather than go into that letter now i should like to develop this important theme which i think the noble lord in particular will agree concerns a very important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come to the point about staffing at grendon in a moment or two <e> <s> staff are a most valuable resource and the number of prison officers in the system as a whole is now higher than it has ever been <e> <s> it is important to get these points on the record in order to put the debate that the noble lord has initiated in context <e> <s> the figure for staff was at the beginning of this month which is an increase of per cent <e> <s> over the figure for st january compared with an inmate population increase of something around or per cent <e> <s> recruitment plans will provide more staff to man the new accommodation and replace wastage <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i can tell and i

lord lord graham of edmonton that managing men and managing budgets are all part of a necessary balance that must be struck in the overall management of resources voted by parliament to the prison service <e> <s> so it is essential that at the end of any discussion the prison governor is the person who exercises control over the way that the resources are spent <e> <s> otherwise it would be a

feels able to support the line which the government have taken on this issue <e> <s> with regard to it being symptomatic of the concern he feels for what he sees as an inappropriate number of offenders being sent to prison i must say to him that while through appropriate publications and other means we take steps to encourage those who may dispose of offenders not to send them to prison

kind of action we saw last week when a prison governor was absolutely rightly continuing to govern his prison and to look after the finance which had been made available to him by vote from parliament is to be called into question serious negotiation cannot take place <e>", "<cs> yes lords i can certainly give my noble friend that assurance <e> <s> it is a matter which has been stressed regularly over the last few days and it applies particularly in a service such as the prison service which is a disciplined service and which involves many different aspects of our national life <e> <s> we are

lord have details in writing <e> <s> the average earnings of prison officers is in the region of a year <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord says about overtime but i am sure he will realise that the amount that is being worked to achieve an average figure of about hours of overtime a week must in many cases lead to excessive amounts of overtime <e> <s> i must say that while it is important that ones response to these issues should be measured there are many examples of which the noble lord will be aware which lead to inflexibilities in the system and to a promotion of overtime <e> <s> that is why it is suggested that we discuss the package set out in my right honourable friends letter of nd april <e> <s> i hope that what has been said in the statement today will go some way towards that <e>", "<cs> my lords there is i suppose a fairly substantial history to what has arisen over the past few weeks <e> <s> the prison officers association says that it is concerned about the

the poa about the safety of prison <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for what i think was a suggestion that at a time when emotions run fairly high and considerable damage has been done it is not sensible to raise the temperature any further than it has already been raised <e> <s> i am grateful to him for suggesting that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to quantify the savings precisely <e> <s> the chief of defence procurement has suggested that a per cent <e> <s> saving overall should be achievable which would take us rather in excess of the million it would be

of industrial resources thirdly by stimulation of new ideas and added to that greater exports which of course have a consequence for uk firms being more competitive in world marketplaces <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord trefgarne and others have answered numerable questions from this box about trident <e> <s> if the noble lord has a specific question i am sure that i or my noble friend

trident which is just one area of defence procurement the best thing to do would be to put it down and then i can look at it in detail <e>", "<cs> my lords contracts for defence equipment involve not

<e> <s> if anyone discovers anything or feels that there is anything that could suitably be reported to the police that may be a sensible way to take the matter forward <e> <s> but i note my noble friends concern <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the charitable status of the moonies is concerned i am afraid that i have nothing to add to the reply of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor on th april <e> <s> as i understand it certain of the new religions in inverted commas are registered as charities but i note the point that the noble and learned lord makes about general registration and i shall certainly look into it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> if anything like that has been known to take place it should be reported to the authorities straightaway <e> <s> i think that the difficulty in many of these cases is getting evidence that will stick <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is a helpful role that the church can play <e> <s> one of the other most effective ways to meet the concerns is to give the greatest possible public exposure to those undesirable activities and some of them are highly undesirable <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall pass on my noble friends view <e> <s> the difficulty is that the law must retain a balance between the freedom of belief and practice and the need to safeguard from abuse the other basic freedoms of members of society <e> <s> the difficulty too is that one mans cult may be close to another mans religion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that there are statistics on the numbers of children who may be affected <e> <s> i note the point of view of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no evidence that any of them have broken the immigration acts but that is no doubt a matter that is looked at in each case <e> <s> if my noble friend has any evidence that any of them have i shall be interested to hear it <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it is possible for house to house collections to be made <e> <s> if they are being made for charities they require a licence under the house to house collections act <e> <s> there is nothing to stop a collection which is not for a charitable purpose taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords in respect of the particular category in which we are interested here as i understand it they are allowed n only within the terms of the acts <e> <s> as i said to my noble friend if anyone knows of any case where someone may have got in illegally or outside the acts and has evidence to support it they should bring it to the notice of the authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting suggestion <e> <s> i said that the home office and the dhss consulted together about it <e> <s> of course the department of education and science is also involved <e> <s> i shall certainly draw that point to the attention of those concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with my noble friend <e> <s> i hope that if any evidence can be obtained to support some of the allegations that have been made it will be a way to take matters forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that they will be committing an offence under the act <e> <s> i understand that to date about applications for registration have been received <e> <s> that compares as my noble friend has said with the registrars first estimate of about being involved <e> <s> applications are still arriving in substantial numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware that legislation was complex and dealt with an extremely complex matter as i remember from first-hand experience having had to deal with it <e> <s> it is early days <e> <s> to enable the registrar of data users to be fully prepared and to give data users time to prepare and adapt their records so that they can deal with requests from data subjects the introduction of the right of access to data has been delayed until november <e> <s> i hope that that will help <e>", "<cs> my lords it has not been finalised <e> <s> there will be about staff <e> <s> i understand that there are some additional people there at the moment taking part in the necessary transitional work <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend has announced the force is to receive an increase in its establishment of up to over the next four years on top of the increase of for drugs work agreed in principle last october <e> <s> increases of up to in the civil staff ceiling should release at least officers for operational duty more will be released by the commissioners reorganisation <e> <s> altogether therefore he can expect increases of up to in his operational strength <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the prime minister is certainly not a breaker of promises <e> <s> what my right honourable friend the prime minister promised was that the police would get extra <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give my noble friend details about paperwork <e> <s> i am aware from my own visits that certainly over the transition period before implementation of the police and criminal evidence act measures there has been some increase <e> <s> however i believe that will not last for ever <e> <s> i note the position and will pass on the comments of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the latter part of the supplementary question of the noble lord we certainly wish to improve the ethnic recruiting to the police service <e> <s> i do not have the figures with me but i shall let the noble lord know the position <e> <s> with regard to the establishment of the metropolitan police today it is not up to establishment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the precise figures in front of me but i shall endeavour to let the noble lord know <e> <s> one of the problems of bringing more people into the metropolitan police in the way that the noble lord lord mishcon suggested is that the training facilities are already fully occupied and it would not be possible to bring them forward in the way that he suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is true that not only the metropolitan police but other forces would like to have more police all the time <e> <s> the fact is that these demands have to be measured by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords remarks <e> <s> he has i think to bear in mind as i am sure others will as well that the number of police has been increased enormously since this government came in compared with the period between and a time which also saw some quite substantial increases in serious problems of rising crime public disorder and terrorist incidents when the strength of the police rose by only some officers <e> <s> since the metropolitan police force has increased by some and we are now adding more <e> <s> i realise the serious concern which lies behind the noble lords question but we are doing a great deal to meet it <e>", "<cs> no my lords that would be a totally wrong assumption <e> <s> the increase in crime over the last years or so has been more or less steady <e> <s> nowadays we have much more reporting of crime and much more effective policing <e> <s> that leads to an increase in numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the last point is concerned we started with a very low number of police as i indicated in answering an earlier question <e> <s> so far as recruiting up to the new establishment immediately is concerned the metropolitan police cannot do so and we have had to phase the increases <e> <s> they plan to take on the extra police officers and civil staff approved for this financial year by april of next year <e> <s> for the following three years they plan to be able to increase strength by police officers and civil staff each year <e> <s> the noble lord referred to training establishments <e> <s> i understand that the information i gave was correct but so far as training establishments in the provinces are concerned i do not have details with me <e> <s> however i shall certainly look into that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend that special constables can play a most useful role <e> <s> certainly the numbers did drop dramatically but i believe they are now improving <e> <s> i believe i gave the details in answer to a question asked not long ago <e>", "<cs> my lords what i can tell my noble friend is that the costs of increases will be met from within existing budgets but that the total metropolitan police increases plus provincial police increases for million for police and some million for civilians will be taken care of through public expenditure costs by <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is absolutely right <e> <s> that is why both the provincial police <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord a member of a party which did not do nearly as much in the years that it was in office in the s to indicate that this government are not recruiting adequately for the police is with respect something that i would not have expected of him <e> <s> the fact is that we have made substantial increases in policing and done a great deal to improve the effectiveness of the police <e> <s> we are now continuing to do so <e> <s> as i said it is quite understandable for either the commissioner for whom we all have enormous respect or provincial chief officers of police to ask for more because of course the more police they have the more effectively they can undertake their work but each demand for extra manpower has to be scrutinised carefully on the basis of need and cost <e> <s> that is what we have done <e> <s> that is why we have increased the numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords those who scrutinise police needs do so with great care and they are thoroughly professional <e> <s> her majestys chief inspector of constabulary is one of those concerned <e> <s> it is no good simply throwing money and unorganised resources into policing <e> <s> it has to be properly scrutinised <e> <s> that is why the need was assessed and established by my right honourable friend <e> <s> that is why the increased numbers have been announced <e>", "<cs> my lords yes that figure is above the establishment figure which they have not yet reached <e>", "<cs> my lords if i said that in relation to the metropolitan police i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> as he will be aware it does of course have a responsibility to the provincial police forces <e>", "<cs> i note the noble lords point of view <e> <s> as i said the intention is that the modifications to which i referred should be the minimum to reflect the structural change <e> <s> should the new employer wish to change the machinery significantly he will have to negotiate and he will have to negotiate with the trade unions <e>", "<cs> if a letter will make a substantial difference i cannot believe that it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that it will not <e> <s> i rather agree with him <e> <s> what is said here is as much as can be put in a letter <e> <s> if the noble lord lord graham would like to discuss this i can facilitate an arrangement whereby the terms of such a letter can be discussed <e> <s> beyond that i cannot go <e>", "<cs> once again the noble lord lord graham has put forward an amendment which he has argued is in the best interests of the workforce and which may on the face of it appear to be a proper step to take in the protection of its interests <e> <s> the government are well aware of the concerns of the dockyard employees <e> <s> a major aspect of the apprehension that the employees feel is the future prospects for their terms and conditions of employment the type of matter to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> he is correct <e> <s> there is no transfer of undertaking when contracts change and the employer that is to say the company remains the same <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will see the force of that argument and will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord has described this amendment seeks to require the secretary of state to consult persons or bodies before making an order under the bill <e> <s> no one could argue with the proposition that those involved should be consulted before a change of this significance is introduced particularly those who work in the organisations affected <e>", "<cs> the proposed new clause seeks to link the pension arrangements for the new companies permanently to the principal civil service pension scheme <e> <s> let me make the position on pensions quite clear <e> <s> employees who transfer into the new companies will on vesting day no longer be civil servants and so will have to leave the principal civil service pension scheme which i think that the noble lord lord crawshaw understands <e>", "<cs> obviously those workers who join later cannot join under the original scheme it would not be feasible for them to do so <e> <s> the employees transferring will as i have said have to leave the pcsps <e> <s> they will have the option in the way that i have described of leaving their accrued pensions in the pcsps or transferring them to the new scheme in their dockyard <e> <s> for those who choose the latter course a transfer payment covering past service will be made from the pcsps into the new scheme <e> <s> thereafter those schemes will be funded by contributions probably jointly from employer and employee <e>", "<cs> of all the changes facing the workforce the government are certainly aware that the question of redundancy arrangements figures prominently as a matter of concern for them <e> <s> before turning to the question of funding let me set out the position regarding the redundancy arrangements in the new companies <e> <s> under the tupe regulations the ministry of defence redundancy procedures will transfer to the new company <e> <s> these cover such matters as periods of notice orders of discharge and so on although there will have to be some changes for instance in respect of the field of redundancy to reflect the fact that the companies are separate entities outside the civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing further the government can do <e> <s> parliament has laid down what steps the government may take through the monopolies and mergers commission to investigate trading practices <e> <s> in the event of the monopolies and mergers commission reaching an adverse finding the government have further powers which they can take to remedy the mischief <e> <s> in the absence of an adverse finding as in the present case parliament has given us no powers and i think it would be oppressive and improper if the government were to attempt to put pressure on an independent organisation in these circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly do my best to answer any questions which the noble baroness asks <e> <s> i am sure that the broadcasters are aware of public feeling on this issue and i am quite certain that they will take note as they always do of what the noble baroness says <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord that information <e> <s> i shall find out and let him know <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated to the noble baroness i think both organisations are aware of the concern that has been expressed <e> <s> it is a matter for them and there is nothing that the government can do <e> <s> nevertheless i am sure that they will note my noble friends views as well <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there is a question of public interest <e> <s> it goes quite widely as i think the noble baroness has indicated <e> <s> nevertheless it was right that we should ask them how they were getting on <e> <s> that is what we have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely correct the noble lord about the words my native law because he will find that my native law is scots also <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon and indeed to the noble and learned lord lord denning for their comments <e> <s> so far as consistency is concerned a point which the noble lord lord wigoder raised of course it is consistent with clause <e> <s> i will study what the noble and learned lord has said but i believe the point about our amendment was really best summarised perhaps by what the noble lord lord mishcon said <e> <s> if the person making the disclosure knew or suspected that the investigation was taking place and that is a matter for the jury on the basis of the evidence put forward he would be found guilty <e> <s> what we want to avoid is putting at risk for example a bank clerk who might not realise the investigation was taking place and who might disclose something prejudicial to it <e> <s> we do not want to punish mere oversight and although the prosecution must prove that the person actually knew or suspected the defendant can be asked questions if he gives evidence about the reasonableness of his conduct to establish that beyond all reasonable doubt he knew that he was tipping off the defendant <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> tonight we have completed our consideration of a measure which although entirely straightforward in intention has proved perhaps unusually complex <e> <s> i believe there has been no doubt anywhere in your lordships house about the importance of depriving those who traffick in drugs of the proceeds they have made <e> <s> all your lordships who have spoken during the consideration of this bill and indeed on other occasions have expressed abhorrence of those who engage in this dreadful trade and have also expressed their deep concern for those very often young people whose lives are effectively destroyed as a result <e> <s> your lordships have rightly stressed the need for wide-ranging action against drug misuse both to bring about a reduction in demand and also to take effective action to counter the illegal supply of controlled drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords for their kind comments <e> <s> having listened to the introduction of a slightly contentious point between the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble and learned lord lord denning i will merely say that the extent to which the provisions in the bill should apply to other kinds of profitable offences has been raised before as the noble and learned lord said <e> <s> i have noted the views of all those who have taken an interest in this matter the noble lords lord mishcon and lord harris and the noble and learned lord lord wilson and others <e> <s> the government will of course examine those matters very fully before developing their wider proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long useful and thorough exploration of the purpose and principles behind the bill <e> <s> i am grateful to those who have welcomed the bill either in part or in whole and i hope that i may persuade those with reservations that their fears are unfounded <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a lot of material to get through and i shall never finish if i give way to the noble lord at this point <e> <s> the noble lord lord gladwyn raised a couple of important points to do with differing views in the united states on defence issues and in particular on the latest proposals tabled by the soviet union at the geneva negotiations <e> <s> the government have no doubt that the united states remains firmly committed to the nato alliance as the only way of effectively maintaining our collective security <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall study the noble lords remarks and correspond with him on that point if i may <e> <s> if i have him wrong i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would allow me to correspond with him on that point <e> <s> i am not sure he is necessarily correct in saying that they have been made redundant in the way that he has suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i well appreciate my noble friends interest in and concern for yorkshire <e> <s> i do not think it is really something in which the home office has much <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i understand it ripon was first incorporated years ago in but it was not until that the style city was assumed when the collegiate church became a cathedral and ripon the seat of a bishopric <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> the new treaty with spain comes into force today and replaces the former treaty that the spanish denounced in <e> <s> we look forward to working closely with spain to make a success of the new treaty in the way that my noble friend hopes <e> <s> as for the united states supplementary treaty again we are pleased that that treaty has obtained the support of a substantial majority in the senate foreign relations committee <e> <s> the treaty represents an important advance in ensuring that those who have committed crimes of violence cannot evade justice by claiming that their crimes were political <e>", "<cs> my lords the extradition act certainly does not meet modern conditions <e> <s> the huge expansion in recent years in international crime such as drug trafficking fraud and terrorism has presented new challenges that our extradition arrange-ments must meet <e> <s> hence the need for the changes <e> <s> so far as concerns new bilateral agreements as i said in my original answer we do not have plans to enter into any new agreements but i am sure that should any particular change be needed in the light of the legislation that it is to be hoped will follow that view will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords we published a white paper and the hope is for legislation at the earliest suitable point <e> <s> i cannot of course anticipate the queens speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their comments on the statement <e> <s> i shall endeavour to respond to some of the points that they have raised <e> <s> many of those points are points which will have to be taken in the round with the other views that will be expressed generally on what the statement contains <e> <s> to that extent i can assure them that what they have said will be noted very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i should be very rash to make any categorical statement at this stage with the report fairly new in our hands <e> <s> what i have said is that my right honourable friend will consider the matter in the way that i described in the statement <e> <s> as to the question of selling radio and radio the term used by the committee was privatised <e> <s> the green paper on radio provides an opportunity for us all to consider what sort of radio services we want in future by whom they should be provided and the nature and extent of the regulation required <e> <s> so again i am afraid that this is a matter which has to be considered in the round so to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i note my noble friends remarks <e> <s> we have been much impressed by the contribution of independent producers following the introduction of channel and we recognise that there may be a place for widening their role <e> <s> but we question whether formal quotas are the right way of doing that <e> <s> i think i can only say to my noble friend that we look forward to the views of independent producers and established broadcasters on this important question <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly acknowledge the fact that the noble lord has a great deal of experience and interest in this field <e> <s> he has mentioned a number of points which of course we shall study carefully during our consideration of the issue over the coming months <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he asked about the date of the green paper <e> <s> i cannot be specific but i understand that it is hoped to produce it by the end of the year <e> <s> as to the further timetable i am afraid i am not in a position to tell my noble friend what it will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords comments <e> <s> obviously the committees recommendations have very wide implications and it would be wrong to reach a snap judgment on any of them until there has been the fullest opportunity for debate within the country and among the particular interests which might be affected <e> <s> i think at this stage i can merely note the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that many people share my noble friends point of view i certainly respect it enormously <e> <s> my right honourable friend in his statement made clear that we do not accept the apparent view of the committee that there is no qualitative difference between broadcasting and the print media <e> <s> broadcasting as i said is particularly powerful it is available in peoples homes at the turn of a switch and not least it can be extremely expensive to produce <e> <s> it costs nothing to pick up a pen and write but to produce an effective television programme can require an extensive investment in time and money <e> <s> for all these reasons we believe that special arrangements will continue to be needed for broadcasting to ensure that there is proper regulation of the content of programmes and that there are opportunities for a genuine plurality of voices views and subject matter to be expressed <e> <s> that does not necessarily mean that the present structure should be perpetuated or that the general law suitably modified might not have a part to play <e> <s> i stand by the remarks that i made earlier in answer to the noble lord lord mishcon that those are matters that my right honourable friend has already discussed with the <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly give the noble lord an assurance that all factors connected with community radio and with radio and radio and with everything else to do with radio will be examined in the green paper <e> <s> some of the issues that have been raised by the report will require relatively early decisions <e> <s> others and particularly those that look forward to the second and third stages to which the report refers can be taken rather more slowly <e> <s> certainly those points will be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord <e> <s> lord annan has more experience probably than anybody in this particular field and i readily acknowledge that that is so <e> <s> so far as concerns studying the report i agree that it is a complex document that we would all do well to study in great depth <e> <s> i agree also with the noble lord that the subject of the licence fee is a legitimate matter to be examined <e> <s> that is precisely what the committee has done <e> <s> i share the noble lords view as we all do about the complexity of the area with which the report deals and technology is changing with great rapidity <e> <s> as to a debate i note the noble lords remarks but such a proposal is a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may expand a little on indexation <e> <s> the current settlement which was announced in march runs until and unless displaced by a different system until <e> <s> my right honourable friends predecessor made clear in announcing the present fee levels that the bbc should plan its expenditure for the three years to on the basis that it must for that period live within an income equivalent to that generated by fees at the present level of for colour and for monochrome <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the noble baronesss concern that progress must be made with the new unit <e> <s> at this stage i cannot give an estimate as to how long it will be other than to say that planning is going on <e> <s> we have had close co-operation with the dhss on this matter <e> <s> experts from the prison department and the dhss have met and seen the facilities at broadmoor and park lane <e> <s> the staffing levels of the present unit and the balance between nursing and discipline staff have been examined by the manpower team to which the noble baroness referred <e> <s> the aim will be to provide as full a regime as possible for the unit with appropriate and adequate psychiatric treatment and nursing therapy and care <e> <s> recently a seminar was held to try to bring together the interests of the nursing and the discipline staff <e> <s> it was a considerable success <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the noble lord how many have passed through the unit since the passing of that legislation <e> <s> what i can say is that a senior medical officer with psychiatric experience who has responsibility for the c unit has been in place for some time <e> <s> he has certainly a key role to play in the creation of the right management framework and an appropriate regime <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> yes i am aware of the pressure <e> <s> i am aware of how necessary it was to put those things right <e> <s> i should also like to say however that it is the governments firm belief that those mentally disordered offenders whose disorder is of a nature or degree that makes it appropriate for them to be detained in hospital under the terms of the mental health act should not be in prison <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree that there should be widespread consultation <e> <s> as it stands consultation has taken place between the dhss and the prison department <e> <s> i referred earlier to visits that have been made to park lane and broadmoor <e> <s> in addition visits have been made to a regional secure unit <e> <s> it is important that all of us learn about the latest developments in the treatment of the mentally ill and look at different types of accommodation available <e> <s> if i were to put a timescale to this matter i am sure that it would change <e> <s> it is important to get this absolutely right <e> <s> as soon as i have a timescale i shall let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is of course important that the best use is made of all the facilities at holloway not just c <e> <s> i assure the noble baroness that this is in the forefront of my mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that there is that concern <e> <s> i hope that the improvements that we are considering may help to alleviate it <e> <s> we are looking for example to see whether local review committees can be provided with better information on which to base their consideration of individual cases <e> <s> already the police have agreed to make available in all cases a report on the circumstances of the offence which until recently has been available only in cases involving sentences of over months <e>", "<cs> my lords the six-month minimum qualifying period has a flattening effect on the time served in custody over a certain sentence range but that applied to a different sentence range when the minimum qualifying period was months also <e> <s> the sentence given by the court is still reflected in the length of the parole licence and hence in the parolees liability to recall in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is right <e> <s> the parole board gives great care to its consideration of all cases as does my right honourable friend if cases come to him <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is right also that overcrowding in prisons must be tackled and that is one way to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the last of the noble lords three supplementary questions yes think that it would produce serious difficulty <e> <s> on his point about consulting before change i understand that when the change came forward in the act it was generally welcomed by all sides <e> <s> i cannot say whether the judiciary was consulted i shall find out and let the noble lord know <e> <s> on the question of funds for the local review committees to which i referred i am sure that that will be a matter for consideration as it is taken forward <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting suggestion i shall look into it <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords that is borne in mind <e> <s> there is a balance to be struck but it is important to be aware that those recalled for committing further offences while on licence in totalled parolees <e> <s> that is about per cent <e> <s> of the total recommended for parole <e>", "<cs> my lords concern about overcrowding in prisons is regularly expressed <e> <s> the question on sentencing goes rather wider than the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords there is of course a difference between the two sentences <e> <s> parole is looked into for a number of different reasons most of which have been adduced by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly share the views of the right reverend prelate about the mancheser council for community relations report on heathrow terminal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for that remark <e> <s> it is the case that the work that is carried out by these people is done with all the sympathy and understanding possible <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i entirely agree with my noble friend on both points <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the

move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the amendments as the noble lord explained is to replace what is known as the hypothetical bystander test in clauses and but curiously enough not in clause with a requirement that there must be present a person of reasonable firmness who actually fears for his personal safety <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones explained supported as he was by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington years was the maximum sentence recommended for riot by the law commission and the government accepted that recommendation in the white paper that was published last may <e> <s> we did so in the knowledge that the recommendation was in line with current sentencing practice as set out in appendix b to the law commissions report <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington has indicated in november last year a sentence was passed at the old bailey which suggested that a -year maximum might not be in line with current sentencing practice <e> <s> that sentence was a life sentence passed on a chelsea football fan <e>", "<cs> it appears from what i understood to have been the arrangements on grouping reached <e>", "<cs> i am grateful <e> <s> i shall therefore cover a certain amount of ground <e> <s> the noble lord lord plant has explained his concern that clause which is intended to be a restatement of the existing offence of threatening behaviour was becoming unduly complicated <e> <s> that was the burden too of remarks made by other noble lords recently <e> <s> the noble lord went on to say that the police would find it more difficult to understand than the offence in section of the public order act which it is designed to replace <e> <s> i can understand his concern but i am afraid i do not believe that his amendment would help matters <e> <s> indeed i fear that it would significantly reduce the usefulness of the offence to the police <e> <s> i do not believe that this is what he wishes <e>", "<cs> i do not think it does <e> <s> i shall reflect upon the words of the noble lord if i may <e> <s> but both the

clarify as well as shorten <e> <s> i shall also look at the point of my noble friend lord colville about the relationship between this clause and clause <e>", "<cs> i shall endeavour to answer the noble lords point <e> <s> clause contains the definition of a dwelling and if the noble lord refers to that clause on page of the bill i hope that he will find that the position is elucidated <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has argued that insulting is a weak word unlike threatening or abusive and that it needs to be qualified before it can be allowed as one of the elements in the low-level public order offences in clauses and or as one of the elements in the offences of incitement to racial hatred in part iii of the bill which we shall reach before too long <e>", "<cs> the noble lords amendment would delete the requirement of a victim <e> <s> that was inserted on report in another place as i am sure the noble lord will recall <e> <s> the burden of the remarks of the noble lord lord plant suggests that he feels this would complicate the task of the police that it would make the offence harder to prove and that it would require the victim to come to court to give evidence <e> <s> that would undermine prosecutions because many victims would be reluctant to give evidence and thereby run the risk of further persecution <e>", "<cs> it is not moved <e>", "<cs> as i think i have said before to my noble friend lord broxbourne i cannot possibly translate the last part of his remarks i wish i were able to do so <e> <s> what i think is going to happen is that the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington may raise some of the points that he was going to raise on an earlier amendment perhaps when it comes to the debate on the question that clause stand part or subsequently <e>", "<cs> i for one am only too delighted to hear that <e>", "<cs> to return to the amendment of the noble lord lord monson the noble lord has proposed that instead of inserting a requirement of substantial which was one of the suggestions in an amendment that has not been moved we might instead have the requirement of acuteness <e> <s> we did not want to catch conduct which is merely trivial which is why we originally toyed with the idea of including substantial <e> <s> that is why we have strenuously resisted suggestions that annoyance or disturbance should be included among the possible consequences <e>", "<cs> we have had a long and full debate on one of the most important clauses in the bill <e> <s> the noble and learned lords lord elwyn-jones and lord scarman have concentrated on what they see as the dangers and difficulties with the clause and i shall return to those points shortly <e> <s> let me repeat at the outset what the noble lord lord hutchinson <e> <s> has already said that we have always recognised that it was important to frame a new offence very carefully indeed <e> <s> during the passage of the bill we have listened to the doubts expressed and as a result we have introduced important new safeguards to protect the interests of defendants <e>", "<cs> i do not think that it goes as far as the writing of signs or the daubing of slogans <e> <s> i do not believe that that would be encompassed by the use of the word gestures <e> <s> i shall look at the point that the noble lord makes <e> <s> i do not believe that clause goes as far as he suggests <e>", "<cs> it is surely important in that case that safeguards are built in <e> <s> i should have thought that that was the answer to the noble lords concern <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the anxiety which lies behind these new offences and i know that the committee will join with me in paying tribute to the courage of the policemen last year who had to face a hail of petrol bombs at handsworth tottenham and brixton <e> <s> the manufacture and throwing of petrol bombs at the police is an intolerable evil which needs to be punished vigorously <e> <s> however i have to say to the noble lord lord plant that rather as the noble and learned lord lord silkin was suggesting there is no point in parliament creating new criminal offences to deal with acts which are already criminal and i say that despite the comments of the noble and learned lord lord denning on this point <e>", "<cs> the answer is life <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord stanley of alderley for raising a matter that is of the greatest public concern and obviously of concern to the committee <e> <s> no one watching the movements of the so-called peace convoy in recent months could remain other than horrified at the havoc that they have inflicted on the communities through which they have passed <e> <s> no one could feel anything but anger at the ordeal suffered by the farmers whose land they have occupied and in some cases damaged or indeed be anything but disgusted by their revolting habits as described by my noble friend lady macleod <e>", "<cs> it would be a separate police power that is the way in which our minds are turning at the moment <e> <s> as i understand it the civil law would still remain <e> <s> no doubt there would be other difficulties which the civil law may be used to remedy <e> <s> however according to the way in which our minds are turning at the moment and i stress to the noble and learned lord that we are still developing our thoughts on this matter what i have said holds good <e>", "<cs> the mental element as established in clause is drawn almost entirely from the law commissions recommendations <e> <s> in so far as it applies to riot violent disorder and affray a similar provision is to be found in clause of the commissions draft bill <e> <s> i also refer the committee to paragraphs to of the commissions report which explain why it felt that it was necessary to set out the mental element in statute and why the commission proposed that particular formulation <e>", "<cs> in that case i shall mention them in the interests of speed <e>", "<cs> we return to the mental element in relation to clauses and <e> <s> here we have adopted the same test of intention or awareness which applies to clauses to and the noble lord invites us to add the words <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has stressed the importance of excluding disputes between neighbours from the scope of the clause and clause offences <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is therefore to exclude from the scope of these offences gardens land garages or other buildings used exclusively as living accommodation <e> <s> we certainly share the noble and learned lords aim of excluding domestic disputes <e> <s> none of us wishes to see undue interference in peoples private lives in their own homes and that is why we have made specific provision for occasions where offensive behaviour takes place in dwellings <e>", "<cs> i shall have to study with great care the point that my noble friend lord renton made about the landlord and tenant legislation or whatever other legislation it might be <e> <s> one way to exclude disputes between neighbours may be to extend clauses and to offensive behaviour in gardens where the person concerned resides in the dwelling to which the garden belongs <e> <s> that may be broadly in line with the search powers in section of the police and criminal evidence act <e> <s> that may be the legislation to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> the best thing that i can do is to consider the point that has been raised by the noble and learned lord and by my noble friend <e> <s> with that undertaking i hope that the noble and learned lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> the definition of violence is drawn from the law commissions draft bill and is deliberately open-ended <e> <s> it is based on the premise that it is for the jury or the magistrates to decide whether the conduct described in evidence amounts to violence <e> <s> any alternative definition based on the consequences of the defendants action runs the risk that in some cases the judge would have to direct the jury that even though it felt that the defendants conduct was violent it was not in law so because there was insufficient evidence as to the likely effect or intention of the conduct in question <e> <s> in situations of public disorder it can sometimes be very difficult to adduce the necessary evidence of the effect of the defendants action where for example a missile is thrown but the police do not see where it lands <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may start by acknowl-edging the argument of the noble lord lord gifford <e> <s> i fear that in extending what the noble baroness lady stedman proposes to repeal it is somewhat different and goes rather wider than this bill but i shall certainly look at the point that he raised <e>", "<cs> my lords as well as the police i believe that shotgun users agree that safe storage of weapons is important in keeping shotguns out of the hands of criminals <e> <s> each year about shotguns are reported to the police as having been stolen <e> <s> as i said we are considering whether to amend the firearms rules in that respect <e> <s> i cannot give the noble lord a time on it but i can tell him that it is under active consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware as i think many of your lordships will be of the threat that crossbows pose particularly to animals <e> <s> we are considering whether any steps could usefully be taken to try to prevent crossbows from falling into the wrong hands <e> <s> discussions with interested parties including the crossbow sporting organisations the manufacturers the police and the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals have taken place and we are evaluating the results <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly bear my noble friends remarks in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly the option remains to expand lindholme as necessary <e> <s> i could provide more details for the noble lord but we have to see how it goes <e> <s> as regards matching places with the prison population i think the noble lord is aware that we are broadly on target to do that <e> <s> precisely when it will happen depends very much on the statistical question of how the prison population grows <e> <s> but by the early part of the next decade all should be well <e>", "<cs> my lords a very great deal is being done <e> <s> sixteen new prisons are being built some or so places have been created from the conversion of existing facilities and a great deal has been done to improve sanitation <e> <s> if the noble lord would like it i can certainly arrange for him to have full details of that work and for that information to be made available in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords winson green is not a new prison it has been there for many years <e> <s> we are building a further prisons two more were opened last year and we hope to take forward another two <e> <s> i can certainly let the noble baroness have details about winson green but i am afraid that her question goes rather wider than the wide question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a victorian prison <e> <s> certainly work is being done on it <e> <s> i cannot tell the noble baroness off the top of my head precisely what work is being done or the timetable for its completion but i shall certainly let her know <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly that is an option that must remain open <e> <s> the projections for the prison population are as my noble friend knows substantial and i do not foresee the time when it will be possible to close more than the odd one but i should like to leave that question open <e>", "<cs> my lords under the prison building programme there are two new youth custody centres being built <e> <s> in addition as the noble lord will be aware we set out in the criminal justice white paper the question of perhaps using some detention centres for shorter youth custody centres <e> <s> that is a live issue <e> <s> but the detention centre system remains under-used whereas the youth custody system remains over-used <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not true to suggest that all prison places are as the noble lord puts it sub-human <e> <s> certain of them are far from satisfactory but the report to which the noble lord referred acknowledged towards the end that there had been some exaggerated comment about the state of some parts of the prison system and indeed about the medical side <e>", "<cs> my lords while the courts sentence the government have a duty to provide the necessary places <e> <s> of course it is a pity that successive governments including the government of the party opposite when they were in power did not see fit to conduct a building campaign in the way that it has been operated since <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble viscount that i never lose any opportunity and nor do my honourable and right honourable friends in another place to describe precisely what is being done under the prison building programme and the changes that are being made to the existing prison estate <e> <s> i note what the noble viscount says about those who leave i think those are the words he used winson green <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not say that at all i would say that it is a long-term problem which has been building up over many years <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at a graph of crime set against time he will see that there has been a more or less constant trend since the middle of the s <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree <e> <s> there is however already a wide range of non-custodial sentences available to the courts including suspended sentences fines probation and community service orders <e> <s> we have to develop these further as far as we can <e> <s> there are established arrangements for consultation with the trade unions representing governors and the other prison staff at various points during the briefing and design stages of all projects and the views of staff are taken fully into account by the design teams <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no proposals to amend the law <e> <s> the police have powers to enforce the law and the use made of these powers is a matter for chief officers of police <e> <s> the roadside screening devices are intended solely to allow a constable to decide whether he has reasonable cause to suspect that the level of alcohol in a drivers body exceeds the legal limit and whether the driver may be arrested <e> <s> as delays between the roadside and evidential test may lead to reductions in a drivers level of alcohol i am satisfied that the devices operate within acceptable tolerances <e>", "<cs> my lords the government and the police are conscious of the need to minimise the number of people arrested who are subsequently found to be below the limit <e> <s> it is of course vital given the number of people killed or injured on our roads as a result of drink-driving that the police should have the necessary powers to enforce the law <e> <s> in people were killed and people seriously injured in accidents where a driver was found to be over the legal limit or where he refused a give a sample <e> <s> surely the figures speak for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that but there are i believe devices in this country as well which people can use <e> <s> nevertheless the onus is on people not to drink if they are going to drive <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i did not hear the noble lord lord mellish <e>", "<cs> my lords the important thing is for the driver to be able to tell and he should know that if he has a drink he should not drive <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord will agree that his question goes quite wide <e> <s> certainly it is important that there should be education <e> <s> all drivers should surely be aware that drink and driving do not mix <e> <s> this question relates particularly to the difficulties of those innocent motorists who are arrested <e> <s> what i have described gives light to the fact surely that the number of people who do drink and drive is far too great <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important that the police have accurate devices to measure those motorists whom they believe to have alcohol in their systems when they are stopped <e> <s> that is the important point <e> <s> of course the devices that are used are those which are being developed and i am sure that they will be worked upon in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot do a quick sum off the top of my head but i shall certainly let the noble earl know <e>", "<cs> my lords every effort was made to resolve the difficulties of mounting a sensible and continuing experiment within the present legal framework but we concluded that it would not be right to keep applicants hanging on any longer hence the announcement made by my right honourable friend <e> <s> certainly we recognised that many applicants had worked hard on their applications and we regret the disappointment caused by our decision not to proceed <e> <s> the applications have shown that there is enthusiastic and constructive support for community radio and we very much hope that it will prove possible to devise suitable arrangements for its development in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not accept from the noble lord that the government have misled anybody <e> <s> as i said in my original answer the guidance notes issued to all applicants made it clear that my right honourable friend the home secretary did not want people to incur the expense of elaborate applications <e> <s> at a recent meeting with my honourable friend the minister of state representatives of the community radio association undertook to send him details of the costs incurred by some of their members and we shall want to reflect on what they the noble lord and indeed others have said on how the question of compensation can be taken forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the remarks of my noble friend point all the more to the need for a green paper to cover the whole subject of radio <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand much of what the noble lord says <e> <s> i think that the green paper will provide an opportunity for all those concerned to consider the nature of our national and local radio services in future and the appropriate regulatory framework for them <e> <s> that will include consideration of the scope for a new tier of community radio stations <e>", "<cs> my lords there is always room for more than one point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> this short debate on this amendment has in many ways gone much wider than a debate on a fairly straightforward amendment because as my noble friend lord butterworth has said we are grappling with a subject that goes towards the heart of our legal system <e> <s> i understand the feelings that lie behind the wish of the noble lord lord mishcon in this case <e> <s> we are all rightly and passionately proud of our democratic values and traditions <e> <s> throughout their review of public order law and consequently during the passage of this bill the government have thought long and hard about whether we should have a statutory right to demonstrate <e>", "<cs> in that case i could perhaps cut out half of what i was going to say and speed towards my conclusion <e> <s> if the police wish to use their powers to prevent obstruction of the highways to stop people blockading others on the way to work as far as i can tell from the noble lords amendment the demonstrators may say no we have an absolute right to demonstrate and there is nothing you can do about it <e> <s> that does not seem entirely to concur with the last expression of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> and they would be right unless conditions could be imposed under clause <e>", "<cs> the noble lord who moved this amendment and indeed the noble lord lord monson and his amendment have explained their purpose <e> <s> it is to remove the burden of giving advance notice from the organisers of small marches <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord silkin would exempt marches with an expected attendance of less than persons and the noble lord lord monson as he said in the form of a compromise would put the threshold at <e> <s> i assume that in both cases the organisers themselves would be left to estimate the likely numbers involved and either give or not give notice accordingly whether the march grew as the noble lord lord hylton suggested it might well do or whether it did not <e>", "<cs> they are certainly intended to attract attention i have no doubt about that <e> <s> however i do not think that they necessarily fall within the close definition of clause lll <e>", "<cs> i believe that is covered <e>", "<cs> the third line on page covers the case where it is not practicable to give advance warning of the procession and the noble lords particular case is covered <e>", "<cs> i accept the difficulties that have arisen on one or two issues <e> <s> i am not quite sure that the difficulty about the national front and the figure of which the noble and learned lord quoted just now is really valid when one considers that the national front and perhaps one or two other organisations such as those which i quoted earlier are capable of whipping up an enormous amount of opposition and in so doing they are likely to promote disorder <e> <s> that surely is another very important point when considering whether or not one ought to apply a number because it can grow unexpectedly <e> <s> it is very much the same as the point made by the noble lord lord hylton except that the number is growing not with the crowd that is starting to march but with these people who are in opposition to it <e>", "<cs> armistice days are covered because if the noble baroness looks at subsection she will see that it says <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord finally i rather hope withdraws his amendment may i answer the point about salvation army marches <e> <s> where a march by the army or a particular troop is a regular or customary event then the exemption should be sufficient <e>", "<cs> may i just finish before the noble lord completes what he is going to say <e> <s> a one-off procession called for a particular purpose would not however be covered <e> <s> clearly there is a need to exempt common processions of whatever type of which the police will already be aware <e> <s> the exemption provision was drawn from a number of precedents in local acts and from recent scottish legislation which seem to have worked well in practice <e> <s> the noble lord is obviously not convinced so i think i had better stand where i did earlier and agree to look at it in the same light <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for raising a matter of understandable concern not least to bus operators whose services can sometimes be severely disrupted by large demonstrations <e> <s> i am afraid that the government find considerable difficulty with my noble friends amendment <e> <s> we fully acknowledge the need for bus companies to be given advance warning of demonstrations which are likely to disrupt their services but we do not believe it is necessary to require march organisers to give notices direct to the traffic commissioners or to bus companies to achieve that result <e> <s> we are as i think my noble friend will be aware anxious to keep the advance notice requirement as simple as possible while nevertheless making it effective <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord lord gifford failed to mention is that advance notice of processions is already required in some local authority areas in engalnd and wales by virtue of local acts <e> <s> i have not heard it suggested before that these existing provisions constitute some terrible infringement of civil liberties in the way the noble lord lord gifford seems to feel that clause does <e> <s> there is also a national advance notice requirement in scotland which i understand works well <e> <s> so there is nothing unprecedented whatsoever about clause <e> <s> where advance notice provisions already exist they have none of the untoward side effects which the noble lord seems to think would exist if clause were on the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that if one arrangement is changed in view of the fact that we are talking about a package of different subjects it would be necessary for one to have an effect on all the others <e> <s> however i take the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships will forgive me for a moment it may be for the convenience of the house if i indicate at this point that in the light of events the government are disposed to accept amendment no <e> <s> a on the marshalled list which the noble lord lord tordoff is moving on behalf of his noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both my noble friend lord campbell of alloway and the noble and learned lord lord denning for their remarks <e> <s> i could equally have deployed many of the arguments that were deployed by my noble friend lord campbell had these been different <e> <s> on this occasion i hope that i am trying to be helpful in view of the fact that your lordships house expressed a view yesterday <e> <s> the government were unable to agree to amendment no <e> <s> on the marshalled list for the reasons set out that it would give rise to problems of interpretation and would impose excessive additional duties on local authorities <e> <s> i accept that the amendment of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie which has been moved by the noble lord lord tordoff is intended to meet most of the objections that were raised to the earlier version <e> <s> i am also aware of the strong feelings of your lordships which were evident in our earlier discussions and indeed in the amendment that was carried last night <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly look at that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> to the lords amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed and do not agree to the commons amendment no <e> <s> proposed in lieu thereof <e>", "<cs> my lords i pay tribute to the noble earl lord perth and to my noble friend lord selkirk for their pursuit of the protection as they see it of housing associations <e> <s> the noble earl lord perth called this a simple amendment <e> <s> i would say that it is really rather complicated <e> <s> it is intended as they have explained to provide that the right to buy should not apply to new charitable housing associations which may form in scotland <e> <s> indeed i am grateful to the noble earl and to my noble friend for giving me some idea in advance of the thinking that lies behind their approach <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i got the noble lord wrong <e> <s> i took it that he was referring to new buildings <e> <s> my noble friend lord selkirk raised the matter of the importance of philanthropic donations to this business <e> <s> yes i am the first to agree that they are important <e> <s> but we have to bear in mind and keep in context the relative figures <e> <s> so far as we can tell looking at the accounts of a number of charitable housing associations in scotland they include key ark whitedale kirk care bield govanhill hanover and pollockshields these associations in one year received only in charitable donations compared to total funding almost entirely from the housing corporation approaching million <e> <s> this demonstrates i believe that while charitable funding is important to those who make the donations any money that comes in is of course welcome the two figures have to be borne in mind and kept in context <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept to a limited degree what the noble baroness says <e> <s> if however the noble baroness extends her view a little further north to the north-east of scotland she will find that there the situation has been rather different over the past or years <e> <s> i accept that there is a need for a variety of different housing availability <e> <s> that is the point that i made in my earlier remarks <e> <s> the diversity of housing provision is something with which we need to deal <e> <s> we need to expand

the noble lord lord ross of marnock answered the substance of the points raised by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie when the noble lord lord mackie described his feelings that the east side of the country ought perhaps to be included together with the west kincardine and deeside district <e> <s> the difficulty of actually meeting the needs in line with what the act describes and the

widely recognised that we were dealing with a matter which required an unusual and unorthodox approach and which hitherto had not been written into an english statute as far as i am aware <e>", "<cs>

two-year maximum sentence for a residential training order is anachronistic <e> <s> following extensive consultations we concluded that one year was the most appropriate maximum sentence to use in the future and that it was certainly preferable to six months <e> <s> the reason we have so decided is that first it is important to relate children who receive section orders to their peers who are dealt with by the childrens hearing system <e> <s> the supervision requirements decided by hearings are subject to review at stated frequencies and lapse after one year unless specifically renewed <e> <s> it seems consistent to allow a maximum of one year for section orders and so provide a reasonable period of time for a childs progress and rehabilitation in care whenever that is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful both to the noble lord lord morton of shuna and to the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside for their remarks <e> <s> when the noble lord lord morton raised his

consider whether what he proposes is correct <e> <s> i shall say no more <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that point <e> <s> i do not think that the bill can be reprinted before the committee stage <e> <s> nevertheless when it comes to the consideration of the amendments i shall <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can deal with this from this box but i shall certainly look into the point that the noble lord makes to see whether there is any way that the matter can be dealt with <e> <s> i shall do my best to achieve that immediately <e>", "<cs> i have listened with care to the reasons which have been adduced by the noble lord lord ross of marnock and supported from the alliance benches as to why this change in time as set out in the noble lords amendment should take place <e> <s> i agree with what my noble friends on this side of the committee said because it very much bears out and amplifies what i said at second reading when i explained i hope very clearly why the domestic rating system is discredited and must be abolished <e> <s> i said then that it was unfair that it was illogical and that it is not good for accountability <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just ask the noble lord to clear my own mind <e> <s> he is talking about the stupidity of the government in accepting this amendment but as i understand it the noble lords own party supports this amendment <e> <s> the

amendment apply to this one <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe said that he wants this to coincide with the united kingdom revaluation of <e> <s> unless i am incorrect i believe there is to be a revaluation in so i am bound to say that i am not quite sure why the noble lord wants to postpone it for the next revaluation but one <e> <s> i do not think that i can go over all the ground

that the noble lord will study what has been said and will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt before i reply substantively but i am not sure on what logic the noble lord bases that last suggestion <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord morton of shuna suppose that there are others who could be seduced by the apparent attractions of a local income tax <e> <s> it is all too easy to fall into the trap of believing that local income tax would be easy to operate and would create the kind of fairness that the noble lord lord morton of shuna is so keen to see by ensuring that the burden of paying for local authority services would be distributed among the population in an equitable manner <e>", "<cs> i think i am right in saying that the figures have quoted refer to an individual <e> <s> it would be wrong of me to say otherwise <e> <s> i refer to a single man on the average manual workers wage of a week <e> <s> i stand by that <e> <s> a single male manual worker paying the average rate of lit would be worse off if his income was over per week and per cent <e> <s> of male manual workers in full time employment have an income in excess of that

making in relation to that matter was that local authorities would need to have details <e> <s> it must be local authorities because to make arrangements on the same basis as paye would lead to the difficulties that i described that is not knowing precisely to what it is that one is referring in the bottom line of the amendment whether it refers to local income tax central tax or whatever <e>

green paper <e>", "<cs> the noble lord tempts me to ask him how he expects us to believe that this is going to be such a serious disadvantage to scotland if per cent <e> <s> of the population will actually be either better off or only marginally less than a week worse off <e> <s> if that is extrapolated to england i daresay that many south of the border will benefit as well <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord continues may i clarify whether he is speaking also to amendments nos <e> <s> and conceivably <e> <s> i think that that was the agreed grouping because there is a similarity <e>", "<cs> i understand the point which the noble lord lord mackie of benshie made but the main reason for resisting these amendments is that they would have the effect of leaving within rating some dwelling houses those which are not used as a sole or main residence <e> <s> that applies to a substantial <e>", "<cs> the noble lords point was covered by the first question that he asked in regard to whether some second homes are rated as non-domestic subjects at present <e> <s> that seems to me to be the noble lords hypothetical second home in dunoon which may be let out all the time or very nearly all the time <e> <s> for example perhaps it is let as a holiday chalet at the moment <e> <s> it is impossible for me to answer a hypothetical case without details of it <e> <s> however i believe that the present facts are these <e> <s> yes he is correct in suggesting that but the practice of assessors is not uniform <e> <s> no doubt the particular circumstances of the house in dunoon and the assessor in that area would have to be taken into account <e> <s> perhaps i am not making myself plain to the noble lord <e> <s> he looks puzzled <e>", "<cs> clearly the noble lords lord morton lord mackie and lord taylor feel very strongly about this matter <e> <s> i am not by any means convinced that the noble lord lord morton is correct in what he suggests <e> <s> it seems to me that if a house is predominantly a domestic property then it will come out <e> <s> the noble lord specifically asked about second homes let for part of the year <e> <s> it surely is a matter of fact to what degree they are let for how long and for what period of the year <e> <s> that is what appertains at the moment <e> <s> i shall study very carefully the points made by the noble lords <e>", "<cs> perhaps the best course would be for me without commitment because i should like to study what the noble lords have said to take this matter away and look at it <e> <s> i cannot give a commitment at this stage but i shall certainly study what has been said <e>", "<cs> although the intention behind the amendment is clear there are several practical reasons why it would not work <e> <s> it would result in assessors having to split each sports club into two parts that used wholly and exclusively for sports or physical recreation which will not be rated and the rest which will be rated <e> <s> this will provide scope for endless litigation <e> <s> in a rugby club is only the pitch to be out of rating <e> <s> what about the changing rooms the grandstand the corridors the boiler room the toilets and the car park <e> <s> is the club brought back into rating because it holds a jumble sale on its premises if that is conceivable <e> <s> what is meant by sport or physical recreation rather in the way that the noble lord lord morton of shuna suggested <e> <s> does it include ice dancing but exclude disco dancing <e> <s> these are all the practical matters that have to be considered <e>", "<cs> i have to say that at the moment i cannot be entirely sure of the wording of the amendment because it has not yet been tabled <e> <s> i have not seen the final wording <e> <s> however as i understand it there would be no disadvantage in the way that the noble lord lord morton of shuna described it to authorities in this respect <e>", "<cs> that is a very helpful suggestion <e> <s> i shall certainly look at that <e> <s> what my noble friend suggests fits in very well with what i said earlier bearing in mind the complexity of trying to draft this kind of amendment to embrace the kinds of category which members of the committee opposite are keen to see included in the bill so far as sports clubs are concerned <e>", "<cs> with respect it is a slightly different question <e> <s> that is a subject to which we shall return in due course when as was forecast on second reading we consider among other things tied cottages and so on <e> <s> my noble friend will find that we shall deal with that matter but it does not fit in with the specific nature of this amendment which is specifically concerned with sports clubs <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful to the committee if i were to explain first the general intentions underlying subsections and of clause <e> <s> i shall then deal with the more specific amendment to subsection <e>", "<cs> may i briefly intervene <e> <s> i understand the noble lords point about the difficulty of actually prescribing the specific definitions or criteria <e> <s> surely that is one thing <e> <s> it is difficult enough to draw up the definitions and definitions that will look all right on paper but it is much harder still to guarantee that they will operate fairly and reasonably in the way that the noble lord lord ross hopes they will and that anybody else would hope that they will in practice <e>", "<cs> the noble lords point about trying to define the date of any general election is one thing but trying to define what he wants to see in the bill is probably just as difficult <e> <s> i know his part of the world very well <e> <s> i was brought up there <e> <s> i am well aware of the importance of golf and what he suggests about the huts or whatever being let at certain times of certain years for certain very important sporting activities <e> <s> but i do not think it is possible to tie it up as closely as he suggests <e> <s> we could thereby get ourselves in a much bigger muddle <e>", "<cs> perhaps i ought to start by declaring an interest both as a member of the national trust for scotland and also as a very regular resident at bute house not that that has much to do with the amendment <e> <s> but i have taken a particular interest in the history of bute house over the last few months and i know the part that the noble lord lord ross of marnock played in its early days <e>", "<cs> it is our intention to use the power in subsection of clause to exclude from the category of domestic subjects certain holiday caravans holiday huts and chalets <e> <s> the effect of so doing would be to keep these classes of subject within rating <e> <s> i shall explain the reasons for this in the context of a general explanation of our policy on caravans which i think is what the noble lord would like me to do <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot say whether the discussions have yet reached a point where it would be possible to produce a text for the noble lord but i shall certainly look into the matter to see what i can do <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> certainly having responsibility for tourism in scotland i appreciate very much the need to do what we can to help <e> <s> i appreciate the spirit in which my noble friend has made the point he has put so well <e> <s> i should like to study his remarks if i may and perhaps correspond with him or indeed depending on the consideration that we give to it come back to the committee in some other way in due course <e> <s> i hope with that assurance that my noble friend will agree that clause should stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may explain to the noble lord lord ross of marnock that paragraph has a potentially very useful role to play in the context of schedule because it avoids the need for apportionment notes to be altered at frequent intervals <e> <s> in this way it would help to reduce the workload on assessors which seems a worthy idea <e>", "<cs> i was endeavouring to give some indication to the noble lord lord ross of marnock when he moved the amendment that i was happy to accept it <e> <s> with that i think i can say no more <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> was the noble lord suggesting that those who have their own water and sewerage systems would not have to pay these rates <e>", "<cs> those who have their own separate systems as i explained to my noble friend lord burton at second reading would not be subject to the extra charge or be double charged in the way that i think the noble lord lord mackie is suggesting <e>", "<cs> as i understand it it will be perfectly possible to have a valuation roll <e> <s> there will be no statutory need for such a roll to be maintained but if i have that wrong i shall let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> on the general point of drafting i do not know whether the noble lord lord grimond was here last week when we decided in which order we were to take the bill but the noble lord lord ross of marnock understandably then raised the matter of the incorrect numbering of pages <e>", "<cs> what i said in relation to valuation rolls and the debate that we had upon them was as i understood it i am casting my mind back to yesterdays debate that there will be no requirement to maintain a valuation roll but that generally if an authority wished to it could do so <e> <s> this was a debate on whether it would be necessary to maintain a valuation roll in future <e>", "<cs> since my noble friend lord burton apparently will not be connected to a public supply but will have a private supply the community water charge will not be payable by him so the situation does not seem to arise <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly look at that but i believe it is necessary <e>", "<cs> i have listened with care to the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> while schedule <e>", "<cs> yes i shall certainly bear that point in mind <e>", "<cs> i can well understand my noble friends

the job <e>", "<cs> i assure my noble friend lord polwarth that we are seized of the importance of this matter which is why we may take the type of action to which my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls referred <e> <s> it cannot be taken at the moment as i hoped i made plain when i spoke the first time because the secretary of state cannot decide whether to take selective action until local authorities budgets for the coming year have been carefully analysed <e> <s> at the moment we are analysing those budgets <e> <s> the action is available but nevertheless the facts are not fully determined to enable my right honourable friend to take that decision <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for his careful explanation of these amendments <e> <s> he will realise i am sure that they did not come entirely as a surprise to the government because we did notice from certain scottish newspapers a few weeks ago that the forum of private business to which he referred had it in mind to launch a campaign against clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the noble lord is in order quoting members of another place if they are not members of the government <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord will forgive me i did not say that at all <e> <s> this amendment was negatived and all i said was that the degree of support was not perhaps all that had been claimed <e> <s> i went on to say that even among those who support us and generally there is a great deal of support for what is proposed in this bill we are aware of reservations so i very much acknowledged the point that was made <e>", "<cs> i note my noble friends point <e> <s> i am conscious of the fact that i did not respond to this particular point on harmonisation on the last amendment although the noble lord lord ross of marnock asked me to because i realised that it would crop up on this amendment <e> <s> i reassure the committee that the government are committed to the harmonisation of the valuation systems north and south of the border <e> <s> this is an essential preliminary to the introduction of the proposed national non-domestic rate which is our long-term objective <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can be equally brief and simply say that i do not think the noble lord lord ross of marnock and the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside need be over-concerned about the treasury consent referred to in subsection <e> <s> its appearance represents little more <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if the noble lord is angry about it <e> <s> the fact is that this is simply giving expression to something which already exists and i cannot see there is any particular harm in that <e> <s> i do not know i hope i may discover shortly whether there are any precedents for this <e> <s> i find it difficult to believe that on the statute book there is none but i hope the noble lord will not feel that this is any attempt to indicate sleight of hand or anything like that on the part of the government <e> <s> it is simply an expression which has been put formally into the bill and i hope that the noble lord will accept it for what it actually is <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord has asked whether i can produce precedents although i should not like to come between my noble friends lord renton and lord boyd-carpenter on this point let me say that the noble lord lord ross should look at schedule of the rating and valuation amendment scotland act which he may have here <e> <s> this may have been one of the examples which he has quoted in relation to other parts of the bill <e> <s> paragraph states <e>", "<cs> i can be quite brief because as i have already made clear in responding to earlier amendments the basic purpose of clause is to provide non-domestic ratepayers with a guarantee of predictability and certainty in their rate burdens from year to year <e> <s> we encompassed a number of different reasons why this was important when we discussed the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe earlier <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord continues i was looking so confused because i understood that there was an agreed grouping <e> <s> we appear to have gone outside the grouping and come back to it <e> <s> i originally thought that amendment no <e> <s> would be taken with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i may well be wrong <e>", "<cs> i can reassure the noble lord that the consultations are considered satisfactory <e> <s> indeed my honourable friend the minister with responsibilities for local government and the environment in scotland recently wrote to the cbi and was able to say that he noted that the scottish business rates committee regarded the consultation arrangements so far as having been broadly worth while in terms of the contacts which the business community have been able to build up with local authorities <e> <s> he went on to say <e>", "<cs> i have listened with care to the case of the noble lord for the amendment but nothing that he has said has persuaded me that it is necessary let alone appropriate <e> <s> i say this because in relation to another amendment i said earlier that clause provides precise formulae for calculating from year to year the maximum non-domestic rates for each local authority <e> <s> the clause gives the secretary of state very limited discretion in the application of the formulae <e>", "<cs> i may not have made myself plain <e> <s> i said that what we envisage happening is a single order each year covering all the authorities as the secretary of states powers to prescribe because of the formulae in this clause are so narrowly defined that there is no scope for manoeuvre other than in the three different areas that allow him discretion <e> <s> those are first if the secretary of state chooses to prescribe a base rate under clause a secondly in estimating expenditure on sewerage for the year under clause b in which case the estimate will be based on the figures in <e>", "<cs> with respect the noble lord has misunderstood me or more probably i have not explained accurately enough <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is entirely right and i cannot add anything to what he has said <e>", "<cs> the matter of the appropriate measure of inflation to be used for the purposes of clause is a matter which was extensively discussed in another place <e> <s> i have to say at the outset that we remain quite definitely of the view that the retail price index is the right choice <e> <s> it is a widely accepted index and it is widely accepted as a broadly based measure of inflation in the economy as a whole <e> <s> its reliability and general acceptability is reinforced by the fact that it is prepared with the guidance of a retail price index advisory committee which has members drawn from a wide range of interests including the cbi the tuc government departments and the academic world <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down he raised the matter of particular cost increases and referred to teachers <e> <s> my noble friend lord burton referred to other factors which might impose a particular demand <e> <s> perhaps i may reinforce what my noble friend lady carnegy of lour said <e> <s> it is quite wrong to suggest that a particular new item of expenditure for local authorities would always have to be met purely from the community charges in the way the noble lord suggested just now <e> <s> in fixing the level of revenue support grant for the year as is the case for rate support grant now the secretary of state will take into account all relevant factors including any particular demands on local authority resources in that year such as those about which my noble friend lord burton is understandably concerned <e>", "<cs> precisely <e> <s> if the noble earl studies the <e>", "<cs> i understand the concern of the noble lord in putting down this amendment but i do not consider that there is any need for it <e> <s> it is necessary for the secretary of state to estimate the effects of the revaluation because maximum non-domestic rates will have to be prescribed before the year of revaluation <e> <s> estimating the effects of a revaluation will not be a new business <e> <s> it is already done for example for the purpose of rate support grants <e> <s> in practice of course it will not be the secretary of states estimate as it will be based on returns submitted by local assessors <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i find the amendment unacceptable because it is unnecessary <e> <s> because of the terms of clause maximum non-domestic rates will be prescribed precisely on the basis of a formula contained in the bill <e> <s> for that reason the secretary of state or his representative could not be expected to make a worthwhile contribution to the consultations which the noble lord seeks <e> <s> there is no discretion for the secretary of state to exercise once the new system is up and running <e>", "<cs> i shall endeavour to comply with the noble lords request <e> <s> clause is concerned with the valuation of premises part of which are occupied as a dwellinghouse and part for business commercial or industrial purposes <e> <s> a good example of this is the shop with the flat above it as i heard my noble friend behind me say just now <e> <s> the clause provides that <e>", "<cs> my only concern is that i am not sure that the words as i delivered them from the piece of paper in front of me would necessarily stand up in any court of law in the way that statutes are supposed to do <e> <s> i am sure that they were very worthy words from the pen that wrote them <e> <s> nevertheless i take the point that the noble lord makes <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful to the committee if i explain the background to clause before we come to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the clause is <e>", "<cs> i will certainly study what the noble lord has said but i do not think that

think that it is valid if it is properly examined because as i have said this essentially deals with a matter of private law which i do not think falls quite into the category which the noble lord feels that it warrants <e>", "<cs> i have considered carefully over the period since the noble and learned lord put down these amendments what i thought would be the reasoning that lies behind them <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his further explanation and i am satisfied so far as i can tell with the wording of the paragraphs <e> <s> but in the light of what the noble and learned lord has said

have quite the effect which the noble lord thinks it would <e> <s> it may in fact give subsection of clause an inherently illogical quality <e> <s> it would make no sense for the subsection to open <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord looks at part vi clause of the bill he will see that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is asking so what <e> <s> he was asking me whether or not it was defined <e> <s> i am saying and i hope he follows me that it is given in the interpretation clause clause of the bill which refers to the act <e> <s> so the meanings are identical <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that i would always agree that everything the law society of scotland recommends is suitable for incorporation in every piece of legislation <e> <s> but in this case i am perfectly happy to accept the amendment

no similar provision under clause which applies to other parts of the act <e> <s> as i understand it there is no difference and the same should apply <e> <s> i shall take that point on board <e> <s> if it is necessary to define it and i am not clear that it is i shall table the appropriate amendment <e> <s> however i do not believe that that is necessarily the case <e>", "<cs> i agree <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord i have already said to my noble friend that i would be happy to look at that point <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> if in the morning he studies what i have said which i am sure he will he will realise that it is necessary to do it in a simple and neat way and that what is required for part i of the bill in regard to the definition of the term valuation acts in clause is peculiar to part i but not to other parts of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i shall be able to help the noble lord on the particular case he mentioned or on anything quite along the lines of the late sheriff of kilmarnock <e> <s> i should have thought that if we were talking about residence in the sheriffs court and the danger of breaking into it probably the safest place would have been beneath the court and not in it <e> <s> that is not meant to trivialise the remarks of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i do not know how long we can usefully prolong this discussion <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord has a copy of the notes on clauses which i hope will go some way towards satisfying him <e> <s> if he cares to look at another document a commentary on the bill which i believe we let him have he should have it if he does not i apologise and refers to page and domestic subjects under paragraph he will see that it would not be appropriate to exclude property used only partly for residential purposes and schedule to the bill therefore provides a mechanism for apportioning the value between the residential and non-residential uses <e>", "<cs> this ought to be the last time that i come back to the point because i have agreed to look at what has been said <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will refer to the notes on clauses of which i know he has a copy because i see it beside his noble friend lord morton who was concerned about the fact that there was an extra need to have an interpretation clause for part i of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord shakes his head but that is what he said <e>", "<cs> he suggested that it was not necessary <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says no need i apologise <e> <s> that is the trouble when debating these tortuous subjects at this time of the night <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is going to make a different point but let me continue for a moment and simply say that the power could for example be <e>", "<cs> at any rate <e> <s> the purpose behind the definition of part residential subjects is to take account of that sort of case <e> <s> there is nothing more i can add <e>", "<cs> i believe that it is included but i should like to verify that <e> <s> perhaps it would be best if i correspond with the noble lord <e> <s> that might bring this discussion to a close <e> <s> however i believe it includes them <e>", "<cs> returning once more to the dispatch box those are all questions which i shall have to look at <e> <s> of course i shall make any letter that i send to the noble lord available to others who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> a copy will also be put in the library <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord is speaking also to amendments nos <e> <s> and which i had understood were grouped with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i had understood that we had agreed that that grouping would apply to these amendments <e> <s> it seems to me that one could usefully encompass them all <e> <s> to some extent the first amendment is a paving amendment <e> <s> i take the point made by the noble lord about the definition of community charge and refining what is said in the bill <e> <s> am i right to understand that the other amendments are connected <e>", "<cs> if amendment no <e> <s> is essentially a paving amendment for the debates on the clauses that relate to it it might be a sensible way to take the matter <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not press this amendment on its own <e> <s> the other amendments with the exception of the proposal to call the collective community charge a collective contribution tax which is a new invention merely show that the terminology which has been used and discussed elsewhere has not been taken on board <e>", "<cs> they may choose to do that but if they do they will be defying the purpose of the bill <e> <s> they will be avoiding the clutches of the person who is responsible for the register and furthermore the responsible person in the places where they live <e> <s> i cannot see that by doing that they necessarily can convert themselves into people who would otherwise be paying a poll tax <e> <s> that seems a total illogicality <e>", "<cs> although i am not suggesting this should be the case i should like to ask the noble lord this question <e> <s> if the personal community charge was know as a poll tax which is a matter very dear to his heart would that affect his general view upon the bill <e>", "<cs> i briefly return to what i said a little earlier <e> <s> i fully accept as i said to the noble lord lord ross of marnock that i prayed in aid in my arguments when the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside at earlier stages of the bill referred to this charge as a poll tax that if those words poll tax were used in their proper sense that is of a flat rate tax on each resident in a local authoritys area in very much the way that the noble lord lord ross of marnock described when he referred to the dictionary definition of what poll meant it was quite clearly a poll tax <e> <s> i said that and i made no apology for saying so <e>", "<cs> i am suggesting no such thing <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie of benshie was quite wrong and i must correct him to suggest that by <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether he will <e> <s> the noble lord is saying on the one hand that he may not be able to afford to pay the community charge but that he will be able to afford to go down south or whatever to avoid paying it <e> <s> there seems to be a certain illogicality in that <e>", "<cs> he is going to have to do it several times which seems to me to be the point <e> <s> he is no doubt going to want to go down temporarily under the noble lords hypothesis and then come back again <e> <s> he is going to be doing several journeys north and south <e>", "<cs> it seems to me as if we might end up with a graduated poll tax which would be one degree worse than that which the noble lord envisages <e> <s> we have already discussed in some detail the various alternatives to a community charge system in relation to the last amendment <e> <s> i have already made it clear that the principle of a flat rate personal community charge is correct and is fair and that rebates will be available to those on low incomes who might otherwise have difficulty in meeting the full cost of the charge <e>", "<cs> may i clarify with the noble lords lord taylor of gryfe and lord ross of marnock whether as i expected we shall be taking amendment no <e> <s> at the same time purely because the two are connected <e> <s> shall we be speaking to amendment no <e> <s> with this one <e>", "<cs> if not i shall deal purely with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the new clause which it is proposed should be inserted after clause which has been moved by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe seeks compensation for two aspects of the cost of introducing the new system subsection relates to costs incurred in the abolition of domestic rates and the introduction of the community charge system and subsection relates to the cost of operating that system the levying collection and debt recovery procedures <e>", "<cs> i assure the noble lords lord mackie of benshie and lord morton of shuna that the million to million per annum additional cost includes recovery as well as billing and collection <e>", "<cs> i do not think that it will be possible to provide a breakdown as between when the bill started its passage in another place and when it will ultimately leave your lordships chamber <e> <s> i do not imagine that within the figure of million to million a difference of million it will be possible to have incorporated so far as one can estimate the likely differences that will have emerged over that time <e> <s> i shall examine whether this is possible but i do not think that i shall be able to satisfy the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i think that that point takes us full circle <e> <s> it is the noble lords way of suggesting that the whole thing is a waste of time and money and that he would prefer that we stay with the already discredited rating system albeit modified as the noble lords party suggests and based on capital value and not on relative value <e> <s> i do not think that bills such as these are costed in the way which the noble lord wishes <e>", "<cs> the words that i used and which i repeat are that this will be among the factors to be taken into account by the secretary of state in the rate support grant settlement for and in the revenue support grant settlement in and subsequently <e> <s> those are the words that i used and i stick by them <e>", "<cs> as i understood it yes <e> <s> that was agreed and i am anticipating that noble lords opposite will come in on those grouped amendments <e>", "<cs> we have had a long and interesting debate on a matter which understandably has raised a great deal of interest <e> <s> perhaps the best way <e>", "<cs> unless i have misunderstood that point i do not think that it is really relevant to this particular argument <e> <s> however i shall study what has been said and if i have misunderstood i can only apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i turn now to the matter of assistance <e>", "<cs> there is certainly no question of students being required to pay twice <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should have added the word accidentally if that satisfies the noble lord <e> <s> he is concerned that students might conceivably be required to pay in both establishments at their home and at their place of residence in term-time their university or wherever that might be <e> <s> they will be registered at the address where they live for the purpose of attending the university <e> <s> if they stay at home that will be the address for the purpose of that registration <e> <s> i cannot see that the severe risk that the noble lord implies may occur when this takes place will arise <e> <s> i suppose that it is conceivable but in the realms of practicality once the system is working i cannot believe for a moment that the occasions would be more than very few and i am sure that in time good practice will ensure that it does not happen <e>", "<cs> i accept that there is movement <e> <s> having taken on board that particular concern perhaps i may continue as it will crop up as i develop a little further the whole question of students and discuss the arguments that have have been put forward about students whether they be overseas students or students living in digs in the byres road area of glasgow <e>", "<cs> i shall come to them in a moment and i shall answer the noble lord when i deal with overseas students in general <e>", "<cs> perhaps i ought to clarify my facts on that point and i shall do so when i come to wind up <e>", "<cs> at very great length and i shall come to it in due course we shall consider clause which deals with collective community charges <e> <s> when we deal with that i hope that my noble friend will be further enlightened <e> <s> i do not think that i can deal with it now <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right <e> <s> it does not <e> <s> that is why i said that where the degree of use is significant in a commercial sense i think that this is the noble lords point they would probably continue to be valued as non-domestic which means that they will be subject to part-residential treatment <e> <s> that is my understanding <e> <s> if i have misunderstood it i shall let the noble lord know but from the information i have i believe that to be the case <e>", "<cs> since i deal with the health service in scotland fairly regularly perhaps i can say two things to the noble lord <e> <s> first on the matter of pay the independent review body which was set up by this government in to look at pay has met the nurses pay review body in full ever since then <e> <s> secondly while i fully share and recognise the need to encourage nurses to take up the profession and indeed to retain those who are within the profession a scheme called project of which the noble lord may be aware is designed for precisely that purpose <e> <s> it is designed to take nursing out of training and more into education <e> <s> it provides for the need to encourage nurses to come forward in a way that he would find quite acceptable <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble lord is necessarily right <e> <s> there is much to encourage nurses to stay within scotland <e> <s> indeed i am sure that many of them would be reluctant to come to england <e> <s> in any case in due course the same situation will appertain here as will be the case in scotland after this bill is enacted <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly take on board the points made by my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> perhaps i can now briefly answer my noble friend lord selkirk and say that neither apprentices nor the armed forces would come into the category in the way he thought they might <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does that and i hope he will not i should like to say that i hope he understood what i said <e> <s> if he has not understood i must apologise for not making myself clear enough <e> <s> in relation to the whole group of amendments which raised a number of different issues on students including the matter of overseas students i said that i would study what had been said and would see what if anything could be done <e>", "<cs> i said that i had listened carefully to the debate and that i had listened to all the arguments <e> <s> i said that i found it difficult to believe it would be possible to go so far as total exemption but that there are other ways in which perhaps to some extent the noble lords point may be taken on board <e> <s> i also made a particular commitment to my noble friend lord sanderson which the noble lord seems to have forgotten <e> <s> i said that so far as averaging was concerned i thought that my noble friend had made a very good point and that i would take it away and consider it <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has invited me once more to return to the box <e> <s> i can assure him that i listened with very great care not just to his speech and also the speech which the noble lady lady saltoun made which took a slightly different tack but which nevertheless has been commented upon by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway but also to my noble friend lord home <e> <s> i recognise that some very forceful and important arguments have been made <e>", "<cs> just to clear the point the decision to take it away was entirely my own in the light of the arguments we went through and not the secretary of states <e> <s> but let us not return to that one <e>", "<cs> we heard a good deal about losses on collection at second reading and the noble lord has explained a little more today <e> <s> indeed it is a matter that was touched upon by the noble lord lord morton of shuna when he moved his new clause amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we agreed then to take the amendments separately which brings us to this amendment today <e>", "<cs> the figure of between and per cent <e> <s> was one which i quoted in relation to the director of finance in question in that particular conference <e> <s> that figure was quoted at second reading <e> <s> therefore the figures were not entirely mine <e> <s> i was using someone elses figures as the noble and learned lord would expect <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the concern expressed by the noble lord lord morton of shuna about the use in the bill of the term solely or mainly resident <e> <s> the bill quite deliberately does not attempt to define this expression <e> <s> i think it would be wrong to accept this amendment which would require it to be defined in secondary legislation within days of the passing of the act <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can explain a little further to the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord renton because i think i shall be able to amplify to some extent at any rate his point about precedents <e> <s> it is thought that the registration officer and the court will approach the question of whether a person is solely or mainly resident in the area of the local authority by determining first whether the person is resident in that area <e> <s> in this connection it is thought that residence will be given its ordinary dictionary meaning <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may continue as i hope that by giving further examples to the noble lord whether in england or not and i think that my noble friend lord renton is quite right he may be convinced <e> <s> that particular example concerned where <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment may i answer the noble viscount lord hanworth because he asked about being charged by two authorities <e> <s> i failed to answer him <e> <s> the possibility of double charging is taken care of under clause <e> <s> which i am sure the noble viscount will study <e>", "<cs> i assumed that since this amendment was taken with amendment no <e> <s> the noble lord was not going to move it <e> <s> i was trying to speed up the business of the committee by suggesting that this may be a convenient moment to resume the house <e> <s> in doing so i suggest that we do not come back to this bill until oclock <e> <s> i hope that that is convenient to the noble lord <e> <s> in that case i shall move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the important and somewhat conflicting arguments which have been put forward in relation to some form of special arrangement to meet the position where workers living in tied houses who at present have their accommodation provided rent- and rate-free will be faced with liability for the personal community charge <e>", "<cs> i have listened with the greatest care to the arguments that have been put forward in favour of further exemptions for personal community charge liability <e> <s> i shall deal with each category in turn <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ross of marnock said we have decided that certain narrowly defined exclusions are justified in the case of those for whom the concept of accountability can at best be limited <e> <s> i shall come to the other categories <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i can finish my argument before my noble friend continues if he will allow me to do so <e>", "<cs> i shall deal with that whole question in a moment but in the interests of time and speed i want to reach those points as fast as i can <e>", "<cs> that is a point to which i should have perhaps responded <e> <s> i cannot tell whether my noble friend lord campbell is right or whether indeed my noble friend lady carnegy is right <e> <s> it could be one or the other and i should not like to commit myself at this point <e> <s> it appears to me that what everybody seems to agree should happen is that those who are in this unfortunate category should not be saddled with this particular charge <e> <s> how to achieve that i am not sure but i take note of both the points that have been raised <e>", "<cs> it may be of assistance to the committee if i explain the reason for the exemption from personal community charge liability of persons in respect of whom child benefit is payable because as the noble lord will appreciate this also comes into the concept of the amendment which the noble lord has put down <e> <s> these will be people who are either still at school or attending certain courses of non-advanced further education <e> <s> in any case they will be fairly dependent on their parents <e> <s> if they were liable for the personal community charge their parents would in fact have to pay for it <e> <s> that cannot be right since the personal community charge as i have said on more than one occasion is in principle the personal responsibility of each individual resident <e>", "<cs> i confess that when i studied these amendments i confirm to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie that amendment no <e> <s> is grouped with amendment no <e> <s> i found them rather puzzling <e> <s> i first refer to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it appears to remove any liability for the collective community charge from owners of the premises to which the charge relates but provides instead that the owners should supply information about their tenants and sub-tenants to the registration officer <e> <s> tenants and sub-tenants would then be liable for the collective community charge and payments would be made presumably in relation to the length of each tenancy <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first apologise to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway for not answering his point which escaped me for the moment <e> <s> students will not be liable to the collective community charge they can only be liable for the personal community charge <e> <s> i hope that clears the noble lords mind and that he now understands the relevance of subsection b <e>", "<cs> if it is a fog which is before the eyes of the noble lord lord ross of marnock perhaps i can persuade him that it is only a mist and a fairly thin one because there is a need for the category exemption covered by paragraph c <e> <s> there may be a few circumstances in which in the new system the sole or main residence of people remains subject to rating <e> <s> this would apply i hope that this may answer the point of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie to patients in hospital whose stay is so prolonged as to make the hospital their sole or main residence <e> <s> such people have little contact with the world outside <e> <s> it is our policy that they should be exempt from the personal community charge <e> <s> in the case of patients in <e> <s> national health service hospitals this would be achieved by exempting them as a <e>", "<cs> the amendment has a number of technical deficiencies <e> <s> for example it would relate only to exceptions granted under clause and not to categories such as prisoners or long-term hospital patients who in accordance with our stated intentions will be exempted by other mechanisms <e> <s> it is not entirely clear that the payment of the proposed compensation to the levying authority that is to say the regional or islands council would feed through to the district council in the manner suggested by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> but the objective is clear enough <e> <s> i shall address myself to that <e>", "<cs> they were charming <e>", "<cs> we have already considered in some detail the position of some elements of what this amendment is connected with <e> <s> this was done in connection with earlier amendments put down by the noble lady lady saltoun and my noble friend lord polwarth because of the connection with tied properties <e>", "<cs> i answered that point last week when the noble lord lord morton of shuna raised the matter <e> <s> it may be that clarification is needed about the position of nurses and students <e> <s> that is a matter which is encompassed within the question of students generally which i undertook to consider last week <e> <s> i hope that that point is one which the noble lord will accept <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside has perhaps forgotten that we are trying here to make a change to reflect the point made by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie about accountability and the fact that all kinds of people whether they are nurses members of the armed forces prison officers or whatever make some use of local authority services <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord hughes goes any further he might find it useful to study the remarks that i made in relation to lady saltouns point when we were in committee last week <e> <s> i went into this in considerable depth and i think i was able to satisfy the noble lady <e> <s> therefore i do not think that we can go back and debate at length again an issue that we debated at considerable length last time <e> <s> we have a long way to go with this bill <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will take my word that it is there in the <e>", "<cs> i do not think that that is a very helpful suggestion <e>", "<cs> that particular point is one of the points that was crossing my mind and that is why i sensed that there may be some complexity in it if not difficulty <e> <s> i shall certainly undertake to do what i originally undertook to do <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the noble lord lord grimond is accurately reflecting what my noble friend lady carnegy said <e>", "<cs> i would have to study my noble friend lady carnegys remarks in order to be able to respond fairly to the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> maybe i failed to pick up a nuance in my noble friends remarks which the noble lord lord grimond picked up <e> <s> what i said in relation to the earlier amendments tabled by the noble lady lady saltoun was if my memory serves me right that there would be nothing to prevent an employer taking account of that or any other matter when it came to making arrangements for an individuals pay salary or whatever <e>", "<cs> i think we are getting rather wide of the point <e> <s> if anything the noble lord is making a case which goes very much against the case of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter in raising the matter of the armed forces or indeed the matter raised by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> if the noble lord lord howie of troon were to go any further down that road he would only make any possibility of seeing any way through this argument even less likely because he points to so many complexities that perhaps the way we have it in the bill is the best after all <e>", "<cs> it may assist the committee if i explain how we see the timetable for the announcement of revenue support grant and the determination by local authorities of their personal community charge working <e> <s> at present local authorities are required to determine their rate by th march in each year with the rates becoming payable usually in monthly instalments as from may <e> <s> the arrangements proposed by schedule for the payment of the personal community charge are rather different <e> <s> we envisage that the standard arrangements will be for monthly instalments to be paid starting in april <e> <s> if my memory serves me right that is a point which would have satisfied my noble friend lord burton because he raised it earlier on <e>", "<cs> i shall respond to the noble lords suggestion of explaining how we envisage the procedures by which a local authority will determine the amount of its personal community charge <e> <s> the amount to be covered by the community charges as a whole is in accordance with clause the amount which is not already covered by other sources of local authority income <e> <s> the amount to be met by the community charges must cover the budgeted expenditure of the local authority including of course all expenditure at the margin in excess of assessed need <e> <s> in order to make this calculation we envisage that the local authority will divide the total amount which has to be raised by community charges by a number which will represent the number of units of community charge available to the local authority <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend lord sanderson i cannot accept that the standard community charge is a property tax <e> <s> on the contrary it is precisely what its name implies <e> <s> the word standard means that it will be levied at a flat rate in each area with no variation to reflect the circumstances of particular types of property <e> <s> it will differ crucially from the present tax domestic rates which is a property tax with an astonishingly complex system surrounding it and one which takes account or fails to take account depending on ones point of view of so many different factors about the circumstances of particular properties <e>", "<cs> i think perhaps i should start by saying not for the first time that the premises in relation to which the standard community charge is payable are dwelling houses which are not the sole or main residence of any person <e> <s> that is the point from which we start <e> <s> the clause provides and these amendments would seek to delete the possibility of prescription by the secretary of state of a class or classes of premises in relation to which the standard community charge should not be payable <e> <s> under subsection such prescription may be by reference to such factors as may be prescribed <e>", "<cs> i do not think that that is the case <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend lord burton misunderstood me <e> <s> i was referring not to uninhabited properties but to uninhabitable ones <e> <s> i may not have made myself plain but certainly that was the burden of my remarks <e>", "<cs> with respect that was never the suggestion that i made nor is it contained in the bill <e> <s> the noble lord is misquoting part of my remarks <e> <s> what i said was that this measure related to uninhabitable property <e> <s> when it comes to prescribing or framing regulations the question of physical condition and indeed the suitability of that property for human habitation taken in its wider sense and revolving around the question of its physical condition are the matters which would be taken into account <e> <s> what has been set out in the bill and what i have tried to describe meets the concern of the noble <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord is asking me to do is to define in the bill that which will be prescribed in the regulations <e> <s> that is the whole point of having the regulations <e> <s> i have given some examples of the kind of things that would be taken into account when it comes to considering unsuitability <e> <s> those criteria may concern physical conditions for human habitation they may cover a number of other factors <e> <s> it seems to me quite extraordinary to suggest as has been suggested that houses might be made uninhabitable so that in some way it would advantage people <e> <s> surely that would be wholly to the detriment of the person who is trying to sell the house <e> <s> the noble lord opposite referred to the case of property changing hands in aberdeen for example <e> <s> i think that that is a rather bizarre suggestion <e> <s> it would not be to the advantage of the person selling the house any more than it would be to the advantage of anybody who ultimately might buy it <e> <s> i do not think that there is much mileage to be gained there <e>", "<cs> i am aware of it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord morton of shuna raised this in a somewhat different form earlier <e> <s> i endeavourd to write to him to explain it and set his mind at rest <e>", "<cs> it is unlikely that in a three-month period a house would become uninhabitable if it had been wholly habitable before <e> <s> maybe i have misunderstood the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> i think that the answer to the noble lords question is no <e> <s> if after three months the house had not been sold and was uninhabitable then <e>", "<cs> perhaps the best thing is for me to study the noble lords remarks <e> <s> if i can get an answer to him i shall endeavour to do so <e> <s> perhaps i am being slow <e> <s> maybe i have misunderstood him and there is some gap <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that i do not understand the bill <e> <s> he is making remarks himself about not understanding the bill but we all know that he is beginning to understand it in the light of some of the explanations that the government have given <e>", "<cs> it appears that the argument is boiling down to the question of time <e> <s> my noble friend made a good point <e> <s> the easiest way may be for me to take this matter away and to look at it to see whether we can make any more sense of the arguments about the time factor which have been put forward <e> <s> my noble friend suggested that we should extend the time factor to cater for houses such as those in some parts of aberdeenshire mentioned by the noble lord lord kirkhill <e> <s> i am well aware of the difficulties that arise in places that have declined <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment may i answer his point about amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> the arguments on these amendments are bound up with one another <e> <s> at this stage the easiest thing may be to say that i take the spirit of the noble lords suggestion about amendment no <e> <s> a and the point that we have just discussed <e> <s> i am prepared to take the matters away <e> <s> i cannot give any firm undertakings as i think the noble lord will understand but i understand the spirit with which he refers to the amendment and the points which have been made about the other amendments <e> <s> i shall look at that as well <e>", "<cs> in response to the noble lord lord morton of shunas amendments nos <e> <s> and and in addition no <e> <s> perhaps i may start with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i hope i shall be able in part at least to point to certain improvements in paragraphs b and c which form the main point in his amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the arguments in dealing with clause fall into four different parts a justification in principle for the standing community charge the level of the charge the liability for the charge and the period of grace <e>", "<cs> since this is the first occasion on which we have dealt in detail with the question of the collective community charge i ought perhaps to start by describing in general terms how we envisage the operation of the collective community charge <e> <s> the green paper proposed that in order to deal with the small numbers of people whose mode of life was so mobile as to make individual registration of the personal community charge impracticable a collective community charge should be levied in respect of the premises in which such people live <e>", "<cs> will the noble and learned lord repeat the grouping that he gave so that i do not get into a muddle <e> <s> there may have been a slight change <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> there has been a certain amount of paper flying around and i wanted to ensure that i was dealing with the right bit <e>", "<cs> i think i indicated earlier the basic purpose of the collective community charge <e> <s> it may help if i go further and explain the purpose of the multiplier <e> <s> in dealing with this fairly broad group of amendments it may be helpful if i give a general explanation of how it works <e> <s> i shall try to keep it as short as i can <e>", "<cs> i ought to have the answer to a technical question such as this at my fingertips <e> <s> that may be a point on which i shall have to elucidate the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i ought to study this question <e> <s> i may well mislead the noble lord if i were to answer him directly <e> <s> i fear that i may be giving him inaccurate information <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i know he is keen to hear some answers to the points which he raised concerning amendments nos <e> <s> zb and aa <e> <s> perhaps i may say without repeating the explanation which i have given concerning the question of the basic purpose of the collective community charge multiplier that amendment no <e> <s> zb is similar to amendment za with the difference that the secretary of state has to make good any shortfall between the sum collected by the owner of premises subject to the collective community charge and what is described as the invoiced liability <e>", "<cs> presumably the answer lies in the fact that the appropriate register will contain details of the persons previous address <e> <s> if someone turns up for a very short period in the way that the noble lord suggests that will be taken account of because it will be possible to trace it through the address given and see what that place was <e> <s> that is a way of verifying it <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can go much further than to say that the individual paying the personal community charge will presumably have a receipt <e> <s> the noble lord must not interrupt me as he looks as though he is about to do before i have explained what it is he has asked me to explain <e> <s> he will <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> the landlord can consult the public register <e> <s> that is the first point <e> <s> nor need this particular matter the noble lord is always very ready to hear half an argument or half an answer without hearing the whole thing <e> <s> perhaps if he bore with me for a moment or two i will come back to the general point in a moment he would understand that it is not necessary for this sort of issue which i understand he is concerned about to be sorted out immediately someone arrives at the collective community charge premises <e> <s> indeed that seems to me to be largely the purpose of subsection which the noble lord writes off as not being relevant <e>", "<cs> i think it is a matter for the noble lord lord morton to decide whether it is a miserable little issue or not <e> <s> it is not a matter for me <e>", "<cs> i do not always intend to indicate that what the noble lord is suggesting in his amendments is not beyond the realms of possibility and that perhaps every single corner he turns to in the bill is not one which we could look at <e> <s> i can say that i am happy to accept the principle of the amendment <e> <s> i also have to say to him that i am a little concerned that the drafting may not make it exactly clear that it is the person to whom repayment of the sum is due who must claim repayment within three months of the date of payment <e> <s> if the noble lord is happy to take it away on the understanding that y accept the point he makes i would hope to be able to come forward with something on these lines later <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly bear my noble friends point in mind <e> <s> in answer to the noble lord lord morton i sincerely hope that six lines will not be necessary to encompass what he believes is required <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will understand that it is important that the registration officer should have and should be seen to have a considerable degree of independence from the local authority <e> <s> he will be responsible for establishing and keeping up to date the register which will be the basis of the new system and it must be clear that he should be able to do so in terms of the general duty set out in subsection which i think we shall discuss on the next group of amendments without any suggestion that the local authority should be able to interfere with his exercise of that duty <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong the discussion <e> <s> however if the noble lord looks at clause under interpretation he will see that where it refers to registration officer in clause it <e>", "<cs> i do not think that that is too complicated <e> <s> i accept that it might not be as simple as having a separate interpretation clause for clause <e> <s> however that takes us back to the whole interpretation argument put forward by my noble friend lord gray today and last week <e>", "<cs> the community charge is of course a form of local taxation like domestic rates although it will be much more visibly linked with the level of local services provided <e> <s> it is natural therefore to assume that all arrangements for its collection ought to be locally based and the arguments for not doing so would have to be very compelling indeed before centralised arrangements could be considered a viable alternative <e> <s> i have not heard such arguments put forward in an acceptable way <e>", "<cs> i listened with interest to the noble lords explanation of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord may feel that as amendment no <e> <s> is connected with this amendment under the grouping list that was agreed it may be relevant to speak to it <e> <s> if he feels otherwise i can shorten my remarks <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can necessarily go that far <e> <s> what i hope to do is simply to shorten our consideration by taking the two amendments in the way i thought had been agreed but perhaps that was somehow missed out <e>", "<cs> in response to my noble friend i should say that it is all very well to produce particular instances of places in inverness or anywhere else <e> <s> if the noble lord feels that there is a problem in a particular locality that is something which he could take up with the registration officer <e> <s> if he wanted to raise it with me i should be happy to look at it but i cannot answer that point at the moment <e>", "<cs> i do not really think it would be right to debate the question of funding which the noble <e>", "<cs> before embarking upon a reply which i fear will be almost but not quite as short as the speech of the noble lord who has moved the amendment i think that he may be expecting the committee to deal with the amendment together with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that he did not <e> <s> however that was an agreed grouping unless it has been changed <e> <s> perhaps i may take amendment no <e> <s> as it stands and refer to those other amendments as well <e> <s> they will change or delete the provision whereby the register is to include the date of birth of each natural person registered in it <e> <s> it may help if i explain the reason for this provision which was inserted by means of a government amendment in the course of the report stage of the bill in another place <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can reassure the committee <e> <s> by way of preface i should say that it was after considering the views of the rating and valuation associations rating forum that we undertook to include this point <e> <s> i think that the burden of the remarks of the noble lady lady saltoun and the noble lord lord mackie of benshie let alone oscar wilde relate to dates of birth being available to the public <e> <s> i should make it clear that we do not propose that dates of birth should be included in the part of the register that is made available for public inspection <e> <s> that could lead to the type of embarrassment about which we have heard <e>", "<cs> i shall answer the noble lord since he asks me <e>", "<cs> i am trying to assist the noble lord <e> <s> i endeavoured to answer the point about privacy which he supported by the noble lady lady saltoun rightly and understandably makes about those who do not want their age to be disclosed <e> <s> as i said to the noble lord there is a point in this <e> <s> it was raised by the rating forum <e> <s> there is also another point <e> <s> it was pointed out that to assist in the identification of individuals it would be desirable for the register to record in all cases the date of birth of people who are liable to pay any of the community charges <e> <s> in the simplest example it would allow people at an address who shared the same name to be clearly distinguished <e> <s> for example there may be and there probably will be three john smiths father son and grandson liable for the personal community charge at a single address <e> <s> for billing and collection purposes it would have to be clear which was which <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i am right but i suspect that i may be <e> <s> perhaps one may compare this with a driving licence for example although it may not be an exactly similar point <e> <s> the code number which appears is simply a number in relation to a date of birth which may apply to an individual whom the noble lord opposite feels ought not to have the date of birth exposed but is a kind of cryptographic means of transmitting the same date for the purposes of checking the register <e> <s> i should have thought that there was nothing harmful in that <e> <s> it does not compromise the concerns which the noble lady lady saltoun has expressed on this point <e> <s> i should have thought that it was entirely helpful <e> <s> that seems to me to be very much the burden of the remarks of my noble friend lord burton who seems to have some experience of meeting this problem <e>", "<cs> it appears to me that this amendment rests on a misunderstanding <e> <s> the form of the register has no direct connection with the question of access to it by persons liable to pay a community charge <e> <s> the inspection of a register is dealt with in some detail in clause <e> <s> nor is the access affected by whether the register is kept in documentary form or on computer <e> <s> the provisions of clause which we shall be able to discuss in due course apply in either case <e> <s> therefore i do not think that what the noble lord is trying to do here would improve the terms of subsection <e> <s> i hope that he will accept that and be able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i certainly take on board my noble friends last point <e> <s> certainly what the noble lord lord kirkhill wants to achieve is laudable <e> <s> i am the first to agree with that <e> <s> but where i hope he and indeed my noble friend lord sanderson will feel reassured is that we want to achieve precisely what the noble lord is looking for but in prescribing the form of the notice <e>", "<cs> it may help if i explain the purpose of subsection of clause <e> <s> in the normal case we would expect that the length of the retrospective or prospective period will be no more than a few days <e> <s> circumstances will however arise from time to time in which someone has been resident in a local authoritys area for some time without having been registered <e> <s> in terms of clause such a person will be required in that case to notify the registration officer of his arrival within one month <e> <s> there is no specific sanction for late notification but in that case the community charge will become payable with interest and if the period before the registration officer is notified is of more than three months a surcharge becomes payable <e>", "<cs> as i see it the burden of the amendment would make it incumbent upon the registration officer to consult the person registered or to be registered before he made any amendment to the register <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would achieve this by the simple expedient of deleting the word not from the provision in subsection of clause that the registration officer shall not be obliged to consult the person registered or to be registered and would make a consequential grammatical change <e> <s> i shall study the point made by the noble lord to see whether there is merit in the change in grammar suggested <e> <s> however we should be tangling ourselves in knots <e>", "<cs> perhaps the best thing to do is to discuss it when we get to the point <e> <s> the first amendment is in the name of the noble lord lord ross and if he agrees i am perfectly happy <e>", "<cs> as described by the noble lord the amendment would turn the presumption contained in the clause around and deem it that the registration officer had allowed the request <e> <s> that would not of itself achieve anything since unless a change were made in the entry the register would remain in its original condition and the liability of the individual for the charge would be governed accordingly <e> <s> even if it were thought attractive to use the mechanism to provide an incentive to registration officers to give their determination promptly i do not think that the approach which the amendment suggests will work <e> <s> the logic of the approach which provides for appeal against a deemed refusal is therefore perfectly correct <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble earl lord perth and the noble lord lord grimond have said <e> <s> however it seems to me that the amendment would result in an illogicality because the register cannot be changed until the registration officer has changed it <e> <s> therefore the fact that he is deemed to have allowed the request for a change does not seem to me to have any particular meaning <e> <s> the amendment will presumably provide the opportunity for a debate on the fairness of the appeal procedures <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> his explanation has helped me to understand the point which i perhaps did not take when the noble earl first made it <e> <s> perhaps i can examine the matter and see whether there is anything which can be done or whether we are getting ourselves in a muddle <e> <s> i cannot give an undertaking that that is the case <e> <s> but i shall examine with great care what has been said <e>", "<cs> i understand that the provisions here follow precedents in other acts notably planning acts <e> <s> presumably the same reasons which the noble earl suggested would apply to the documents sent in relation to them <e> <s> apparently so far as concerns planning acts if the planning authorities fail to decide a planning application they are deemed to have refused it <e> <s> it may be that it would be wrong to couple planning acts and this particular bill together <e> <s> i shall study what has been said and take on board the point made by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can look at that in the light of what i have said as regards looking at the amendment as a whole <e> <s> the noble earl lord selkirk asked about time periods <e> <s> the time limit is described under clause b <e> <s> it will probably be a month <e> <s> at any rate i hope that the committee will agree that i should take that matter away as well as the point made by the noble lord lord henderson <e>", "<cs> i certainly appreciate the noble lords concern that unless the registration officers actions are subject to precise control he might be tempted to make over-zealous inquiries in obtaining information for registration purposes <e> <s> i do not think the amendment is entirely necessary but in the light of the noble lords explanation i am perfectly happy to accept it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can give the noble lord the explanation that he seeks and say how we envisage the working of the arrangement for exchange of information between the community charges registration officer the assessor and the electoral registration officer <e>", "<cs> while there may well be a risk i should have thought that the mechanism that i have outlined which allows the person wearing those three hats so to speak to look at the other elements which i have described to the noble lord lord ross of marnock is designed to do precisely that to lessen the possibility which may be real in the noble lords mind that some people may try to get away with it <e> <s> i hope that what is allowed for in the bill will make that possibility less likely <e> <s> that is why i have given the noble lord lord ross of marnock the explanation about the working of this part of the bill and why i believe that the provisions in clause are necessary <e> <s> i think those provisions go a long way towards meeting the noble lords concerns <e>", "<cs> the noble lord should not assume that someone who stays off the electoral register will be able to avoid the community charge register <e> <s> there may be those who would like to but i do not think it will be easy to do that because the community charge register will be based on rather more intensive registration procedures being kept up to date throughout the year with access to a wider range of information <e>", "<cs> i do not have the answer now but i will contact my noble friend later <e> <s> i do not think it could be used because as i have said the restriction is entirely dependent on the information which is required in connection with the other functions to which i have referred under the three hats that this individual is wearing <e>", "<cs> i shall study what the noble lord said but i do not think the concerns that he raises are entirely valid <e> <s> the appointment of the assessor as community charges registration officer ensures automatically that the degree of independence from the local authority that is already enjoyed by the assessor will be carried over as is necessary to the appointment of the community charges registration officer <e>", "<cs> the amendment moved by the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside would remove from clause the provision that the registration officer may require the local authorities in <e>", "<cs> i shall take note of that remark <e> <s> i do not have the information with me to comment on the point about district councils <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord withdraws his amendment which he looked to me as though he might be about to do perhaps i may reassure the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> he asked me during the easter break to mull over the question of people not knowing that they are on two rolls <e> <s> as i understand it if being on the electoral roll leads to registration for a community charge the individual will be notified <e> <s> clauses and are perhaps relevant <e> <s> the noble lord will bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can help my noble friend <e> <s> on the question of the definition of housing body if we look at schedule paragraph we find that in a housing body means a district council in b the scottish special housing association and in c <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend looks at amendment no <e> <s> to clause he will find that is precisely what we propose to do <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can reassure the noble lord lord ross of marnock much in the same way that i hoped i had reassured the noble lord lord grimond earlier that the information that we need is the information which would be provided for starting off the canvass <e> <s> that is why it is necessary to have the names of the householders <e> <s> i hope with the explanation of what we are trying to achieve by these amendments and indeed the point that we are trying to correct by a later amendment the definition in the schedule that we can consider this amendment concluded <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can consider that as a drafting point <e> <s> i shall certainly look at that suggestion but i do not wish to give an undertaking on it without further consideration <e>", "<cs> first there is not very much between myself and noble lords opposite as regards the way in which we envisage the system working <e> <s> it seems to me that in the vast majority of cases it will be obvious who the responsible person is <e> <s> from what i have said it will be obvious that in the vast majority of cases however the responsible person is identified he or she will be resident on the premises but it is conceivable that in some cases he will not be <e> <s> that is why i cannot accept amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the noble lord makes a point about precedents <e> <s> it seems to me that precedents or otherwise one cannot possibly say that just because something is without precedent it must have tagged to it the word odious <e> <s> responsibility comes in a number of different ways <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend lord selkirk will have understood from what i have said that nominating someone as responsible will be an obligatory process <e> <s> to suggest in the wider sense that nominating somebody as responsible could be such a simple process that one could apply the stricture odious is going rather far <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may return to that point in a moment <e>", "<cs> that is precisely what i said i would do so i do not think that i need prolong the discussion any further <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment would be to provide for criminal rather than civil penalties the noble lord lord ross of marnock appears to think that i have this wrong on responsible persons who fail to provide information or who provide false information <e> <s> at any rate that is my reading of the amendment unless i am totally mistaken <e> <s> we are dealing with amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that the noble and learned lord will find that to his liking <e> <s> but seriously it is easy enough to be facetious as the noble lord is about the change that is being made <e> <s> let us come down to the practicalities <e> <s> so that the rolling register can operate properly which it has to do and record all changes of residence and liability as they occur there has to be a flow of information to the registration officer as changes occur <e> <s> the government have reached the conclusion that it would not be reasonable to place on responsible persons the duty of notifying all changes as they occur <e> <s> it seems to me that if we applied that duty to them that would make the concerns of the noble lord lord kirkhill in relation to those who might be sharing flats rather worse <e> <s> we are probably helping in this respect <e> <s> surely it is more sensible to require individuals who become liable or whose liability changes and who are thus most directly affected by the change to inform the registration officer of that fact so that he can amend the register accordingly <e> <s> this provision is achieved by clause and <e>", "<cs> in that case i shall not refer to them <e> <s> i do not believe that to expect someone to provide the information without being asked to provide it can be an objection <e> <s> there are a number of <e>", "<cs> i have noted the criticisms of the existing provision in clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps i ought briefly to explain the purpose of clause <e> <s> liability for any of the community charges depends on the circumstances set out in clauses and in relation to the personal standard and collective community charges respectively <e> <s> liability is not of itself established by the appearance of the name of a person or of premises on the register <e> <s> a person is liable for the personal community charge by virtue of being solely or mainly resident in a local authoritys area and not by virtue of appearing on the register <e> <s> however in order to ensure the evidential status of the register as a basis for instance of the arrangements for the billing and collection of community charges clause provides that subject to the appeal rights the register is to be conclusive in respect of the liabilities it records <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment perhaps i may say for the sake of clarification that it seems there may be a mistake on the marshalled list and that amendment no <e> <s> a should refer to clause <e> <s> i hope that clarifies the point <e>", "<cs> taking first amendment no <e> <s> it may help if i explain why we consider that a member of the public should have the right to inspect the parts of the register which show the names of persons relating to each address <e> <s> unless a member of the public has this right he will not be able to satisfy himself that the persons who appear to reside at an address are shown as registered in relation to it and therefore as being liable to pay the personal community charge <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble lord is being in the least bit stupid about it <e> <s> it is a complex area and as is the case in so many of these statutes the interpretation of the bill has to be put beyond doubt from the point of view of lawyers <e> <s> it has to be clear precisely what is meant <e> <s> the register will not show whether a person named in relation to an address actually resides at that address and is therefore liable to the personal community charge or whether he is the owner but not the occupier of those premises and therefore liable for the standard community charge <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i cannot quite remember the context of the noble lords second point <e> <s> perhaps he could repeat it <e>", "<cs> that is embodied in the answer i have just given to the noble lord <e> <s> if he goes back he will see that we are talking here about a person who is entitled to inspect the register <e> <s> so the words that person refer to the person on the register <e> <s> i think it is clear <e> <s> the noble lord does not seem to believe me but i believe that to be right <e> <s> if my interpretation is wrong i shall let him know <e> <s> but i think he will find that my description is correct because that person is the equivalent of the person on the register <e>", "<cs> i am aware that pressure for greater flexibility in the arrangements made under schedule has come not only from the scottish rating forum of the rating and valuation association and from the chartered institute of public finance and accountancy but also from a number of individual local authority directors of finance <e> <s> this amendment picks up very well the sense of what is required <e> <s> it provides for flexible arrangements with the fallback of appeal to the secretary of state by the levying authority on a basis which pretty closely matches the arrangements under the present system for rates <e> <s> i am perfectly happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make first what i think is the obvious point that payment by monthly instalments is not to be imposed on all the community charged payers far from it <e> <s> schedule provides that where the person liable to pay the community charge has agreed in writing with the levying authority the region or islands council that he will pay it otherwise than in accordance with the standard arrangements that agreement will over-ride these arrangements <e> <s> this means there is nothing to stop local authorities offering those liable for the community charge if they wish arrangement of payment options as they do at present in the case of rates as my noble friend will acknowledge <e> <s> secondly in many cases community charges will not be collected by levying authorities but by housing bodies under the terms of paragraph of this schedule <e>", "<cs> those amendments would alter the reference to equal monthly instalments in paragraph of the schedule to <e>", "<cs> this is a complex matter and i hope that my noble friend will read what i have said <e> <s> i have given him much information and i included in my comments the administrative arguments <e> <s> however i shall set out my comments in a slightly different form and i hope that will satisfy my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i feel that amendments nos <e> <s> and would remove much of the flexibility which described in relation to the amendments in my name and that of my noble friend lady carnegy <e> <s> they would restrict any power of the secretary of state to resolve difficulties or disagreements over the arrangements provided for by levying authorities and housing bodies in relation to the collection of the personal community charge from the tenants of housing that is let by the housing bodies <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble lord lord ross of marnock feels that that is sensible <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord taylor has indicated we discussed at an earlier stage the position of employees living in tied houses <e> <s> this approach is a rather different one but it tackles the same question in that it proposes that charitable organisations housing employees rent free should be housing bodies in terms of paragraph of schedule and should retain per cent <e> <s> of the personal community charges that they collect <e>", "<cs> i shall reflect upon the noble lords words especially as they connect with an earlier amendment <e> <s> i should like to re-read what he and i said then <e> <s> on their merits the amendments are unacceptable <e>", "<cs> it seems that we are encompassing in this clause-stand-part debate very nearly three different debates <e> <s> the first is whether the clause should stand part of the bill <e> <s> i shall come to that in a moment <e> <s> another concerns the merits that are contained in the schedule which refers to it and the third concerns the point which was made by my noble friend lord selkirk supported by my noble friends lord boyd-carpenter and lord campbell of alloway and by the noble earl lord perth that the provision should be part of the bill and not in any sense removed from it and put into a schedule when it contains information of great importance and incorporates if not absolute principles at least a certain amount of detail relating to a new matter that is to say community charges <e>", "<cs> there is always a pitfall somewhere in these matters <e> <s> i shall look at my noble friends point <e> <s> to return to that once more the fact that it is in section means that it was not really necessary to put in a whole new section in the bill <e> <s> but perhaps we had better not pursue the argument any further <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may now respond to the theme of clause and answer the question about why we need the selective action at all which is very much the substance of clause <e> <s> we need it under the new system of local government finance for just the same reason that we need it now it is to protect local taxpayers from the extremes of local authority behaviour <e> <s> that is precisely what has been said <e>", "<cs> what i said to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and my noble friend lord selkirk was that i would certainly consider the points that have been made <e> <s> but i am not suggesting that i will necessarily come back with a whole series of amendments on report which encompass schedule into suitable clauses of the bill <e> <s> what i have said and it appears that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter beseeches me to take the argument no further is that the local government scotland act which this schedule largely re-enacts is precisely that a reenactment <e> <s> therefore there is no need in the eyes of the draftsman or of myself in my capacity as being responsible for the bill or the eyes of anybody else to put it into the bill in any other way <e> <s> what i indicated to my noble friends was that i would take away their points and look at them but without a commitment to come back in due course <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend is not under the impression that i do not take what he says extremely seriously <e> <s> perhaps i may also say to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter who referred particularly to the question of excluding the committee from approving in schedule the paragraph which is headed <e>", "<cs> i am not particularly keen to debate it now <e> <s> however if my noble friend raises the matter later i shall endeavour to deal with it then <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is clearly concerned about this aspect of schedule paragraph <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has raised matters which may go much wider than the schedule <e>", "<cs> the noble lord seeks with this amendment to specify matters that the secretary of state should take into account in determining the estimated aggregate amount of revenue support grant payable to local authorities for any financial year <e> <s> as drafted at present the bill makes no prescription on this matter <e> <s> in this respect it does not follow the earlier legislation governing rate support grant the local government scotland act <e> <s> that act sets <e>", "<cs> the transition to the new grant arrangements could give rise to significant changes in grant entitlement for individual authorities <e> <s> this is particularly likely to be so in the case of district councils <e> <s> the purpose of paragraph is therefore to provide what has been referred to as a safety net <e> <s> thus the secretary of state will look at the grant entitlement as calculated under the earlier provisions of paragraph <e> <s> if it appears that the changes are unacceptable then the provisions of paragraph will come into play <e> <s> i understand that this kind of transitional arrangement is well understood by local authorities and their finance officials under the present rate support grant arrangements <e> <s> for example the changeover several years ago to the calculation of public expenditure guidelines and of grant entitlement through the method of client group assessment has also produced significant changes in entitlement to grant by comparison with the earlier methods of assessment based on historical patterns of spend <e> <s> various devices have therefore been used to dampen the effects of change and to make the changes more gradual <e>", "<cs> i have of course considered carefully as indeed have all of us who have been involved in the discussions on this bill the arguments put forward in support of some form of specific relief for crofters and other smallholders from the personal community charge liability <e> <s> i very much agree with my noble friend lord gray and others when as my noble friend lord sanderson has just now they refer to the special place which historically crofters have enjoyed and to the way they contribute to the value of the highlands and islands <e>", "<cs> we have had a long debate on this issue <e> <s> if i am to embark upon a reply to encompass the detail of the scheme and the amendments that have been suggested it would be only right for me to begin with an explanation of the general shape of the scheme of rebates as we see it <e> <s> doing so will set the debate in context <e> <s> i shall then turn to the specific points which have been raised in relation to the various amendments <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord wishes to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> then i am content for him to do so because i think the drafting is perfectly clear <e> <s> but i was offering him something of an olive branch though a fairly small one on this point <e>", "<cs> i thought i was doing precisely that <e> <s> it is very difficult for me to respond when the noble lord is making interventions from that box <e> <s> but i am happy to accept amendment no <e> <s> and no doubt the noble lord will then move amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i do not think that i can answer the noble lord lord carmichael now but i shall look into the matter and perhaps i may write to him <e>", "<cs> i shall have to look into the detail of what i have just said to remind myself <e> <s> i am not sure <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to comment further on sports clubs in view of the interest of the noble lord lord ross of marnock in certain sports clubs let alone the interest in them of the noble lord the lord chairman <e> <s> i take the point made by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> i hope that he will agree that what we are doing here as my noble friend lady carnegy of lour said is a help <e> <s> it has been asked for and that is why we have done it <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> it would require all regulations under the bill to be made by st january <e> <s> that would be entirely impractical if only because certain of the regulation-making powers can only be used once we have some experience of the working of the community charge system <e> <s> for example the provision in clause b that the collective community charge multiplier may be amended only once every three months <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter forcasts i certainly do not wish to detain the committee for long in responding to this amendment nor i imagine would the noble lord expect me to accept it <e> <s> i know that a similar provision was contained in the scotland act referred to by the noble lord lord taylor <e> <s> although there can be two views on this question in that instance the ultimate result of the inclusion of the provision was entirely desirable <e> <s> however at a more serious level in this country it is generally considered that referenda are justifiable only when a very clear issue of constitutional principle is involved <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that a complex issue such as this would not be a suitable matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend that we must do all that we can to preserve the stocks of sea trout <e> <s> however it is unlikely that the availability of marine food supplies such as sand eels is a major limiting factor in what is known as the recruitment of sea trout in this way although there is some evidence that a shortage of sand eels could affect the rate of growth in adult sea trout <e> <s> perhaps i may explain to my noble friend that sea trout eat other things and are known as opportunistic feeders <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble baroness that much research has been done and is now going on <e> <s> we are continuing to monitor the sand eel population and the fisheries <e> <s> our scientists are further collaborating with sea bird research workers on factors regulating sea bird populations which is the other part of my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is correct and i am sure that the scientists have taken that factor into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords we seem to have embarked upon yet another second reading debate upon this bill <e> <s> we are now at report stage <e> <s> the bill was thoroughly debated at second reading and again in committee and it came to us from another place <e> <s> i do not believe that it would be proper for me to debate in full many of the points which have been raised again by members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made no secret of the fact that they understand that the timetable set out in the bill for the abolition of domestic rates and the introduction of the community charge is tight <e> <s> we spent some time at an earlier stage debating the timetable and i put on record then the governments view that sufficient time had been allowed for the necessary preparatory work to be done to enable the introduction of a community charge to take place on st april as the bill envisages <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord morton of shuna started by saying that this amendment was slightly different <e> <s> i accept that it is slightly different but even so the arguments against it embody very much the same arguments as i made when i answered the points raised by the noble lord lord carmichael during discussion on an earlier amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that my feelings towards a referendum on this issue are no warmer than they were when we debated the matter in committee <e> <s> in fact they are as icily cold as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter suggested i would feel them to he <e> <s> i am opposed to the amendments on the grounds of both principle and practicability <e>", "<cs> but it would make it difficult for the noble lord as well or impossible for all of us <e> <s> my lords i go further it is dangerous for parliament to continue to decide matters such as selecting a subject for referendum in an <e>", "<cs> my lords in our brief debate in committee on a similar amendment to clause i made it clear that while i could not accept the amendment i recognised the genuine concerns which underlay it as regards the overall timetable for introducing the community charge system <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hughes began his remarks by saying that in his opinion this amendment was a wrecking amendment <e> <s> i agree with him <e> <s> basically it is precisely that <e> <s> in committee we discussed at some length the proposition that domestic rates should be replaced by local income tax <e> <s> as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said the opinion of the committee was tested on that proposition <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ross of marnock is so keen to speed up the proceedings i am reluctant to follow others over the old ground <e> <s> however i understand from the last remarks of the noble lord that he was a late convert at least to some extent to local income tax <e> <s> i thought that that was a policy which his party did not eschew <e> <s> the noble lord indicates that despite remarks which i shall study he is not a convert to what the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe feels will be beneficial <e>", "<cs> my lords the paper does not represent a bill which is before your lordships <e> <s> it is a collection of ideas which have been produced by a group who are perfectly entitled to produce it just as those who are patrons of an organisation are perfectly entitled to be patrons of the organisation <e> <s> the noble lord can read further the comments made about the decay of local government <e> <s> if the noble lord reads page and shows that to the noble lord lord ross of marnock there might be a common understanding between them as to what has led us in part to the existing situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have considered again the point raised in committee by the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove as to whether domestic subjects should be kept on the valuation roll after st april but at nil value <e> <s> the first and most obvious argument against doing so is of course that it would be very odd to keep property on a statutory document which was termed a valuation roll but without ascribing any values to that property <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment in the name of my noble friend lord campbell of croy requires us to consider the treatment under the bill of what are generally termed residential caravans <e> <s> i find the amendment somewhat difficult to respond to because in some respects it is unnecessary in so far as what it seeks to achieve is already covered by other provisions in the bill <e> <s> in other respects however it goes further than i believe is appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that we are not arguing at cross purposes <e> <s> i sincerely hope that i am not arguing at cross purposes with my noble friend lord campbell of croy <e> <s> i do not believe i am with the noble lord lork kirkhill <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house once more all i can say is that the amendment gives that appearance to me <e> <s> when we looked at it that is what we thought it would achieve <e> <s> it would be for others to establish whether it went that far <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will be satisfied that that is one of the considerations that we had to take into account when we looked at the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house once more if i failed to copy letters i can only apologise <e> <s> i wrote several letters over that period <e> <s> sincerely apologise if the noble lord and his colleagues were not aware of our intentions <e> <s> it was certainly far from my intention to try to confuse them or deprive them of information <e> <s> i will ensure that any other letters written are copied to leading spokesmen on all <e>", "<cs> my lords i have considered very carefully indeed the points which were made when we debated this subject in committee <e> <s> i made clear on that occasion that i very much recognised the anxieties of the national trust for scotland on this matter and i acknowledge that that recognition is shared by a number of noble lords who spoke in committee and who have contributed to our discussion today <e> <s> but having said that i must advise the house that in the light of my consideration i am still no happier with the amendment that i was earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house let me say that i certainly should not like to embark on a study of any individual case from the dispatch box to decide how the organisation should seek to alleviate any problems which might arise in regard to particular property <e> <s> i hope that in answering the point made by the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside i have stressed the difficulties that would accrue if we were to follow the route that he suggests <e> <s> if the noble lord has a particular case in mind and brings it to my attention explicitly and in detail i shall certainly be very happy to look into it but i think that that is too narrow and too particular an example for me to respond to without thought <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i quite understand the noble lords point <e> <s> is he asking me to go into detail about every aspect of national trust property or is he asking a question in relation to any specific area <e> <s> i am not quite sure of the burden of his question <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i point out that as i understand it the national trust for scotland has properties which are maintained and furnished as dwelling houses <e> <s> they are divided into three broad categories <e> <s> first there are those unsuitable for residential use for example a glasgow tenement <e> <s> there are of those <e> <s> then there are those which are wholly or partly used for residential purposes for example the house of the binns with which the noble lord will be familiar <e> <s> there is a total of of those <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord would have been familiar with it but he certainly knows someone who is familiar with it <e> <s> then there are those which are the subject of short or long-term lets for example malleny house balerno and which are not open to the public <e> <s> there are of those in total <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is making comments <e> <s> does he wish to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i could give many examples myself but in the interests of time i was keeping it to one example of each <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that if the noble lord studies what i have said he will understand it <e> <s> if he would like to hear it again i shall repeat it but i hope that what i have said has set in context the mechanism and the details of what kind of properties would be affected <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> with the leave of the house and i am not sure how many times i can return to the box and ask for your lordships leave a number of properties are commercial in their nature and some of them no doubt fall into the category of the examples that i have just given <e> <s> some will fall within the category of non-domestic rating <e> <s> therefore i fail to see what else i can add to the remarks that i have already delivered <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be going a little far to describe this amendment as a curates egg <e> <s> parts of it are indeed quite unacceptable <e> <s> the rest while by no means excellent at least shows some understanding of what we are trying to achieve <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think so <e> <s> if the noble lord were to suggest that i should have to ask him to expand a little on the reasons which he believes underlie the assumptions which he makes that possibly paragraph b could be used in that way <e> <s> i do not know whether he feels that this is the right moment to do so <e> <s> however i do not think that it would be and the matters of principle to which i referred earlier so far as the extension on the national trust and connected matters are concerned would still apply whether or not paragraph b was a suitable vehicle in the way in which suggested <e> <s> i shall certainly look at that matter <e> <s> but i fear that i shall probably have to disappoint him <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to the explanation which the noble and learned lord gave <e> <s> i have to say to him that in accordance with the undertaking which my noble friend lord dundee gave when we discussed this matter in committee we have had further consultations with scottish womens aid on the best treatment for womens refuges under the new system <e> <s> however against the background of the system as a whole i do not think that the most appropriate solution would be for all such refuges to remain in rating as this amendment would provide for <e> <s> that would mean that all those who were solely or mainly resident in the refuges would be exempt from personal community charge liability for the period during which they were so resident <e> <s> this would have the curious effect of differentiating between the inhabitants of refuges who were not solely or mainly resident there and who would normally be registered for the personal community charge at their home address and those who were solely or mainly resident in the refuge who would be exempt <e> <s> i do not therefore consider that this solution would be a sound basis for the treatment of womens refuges <e> <s> i should also mention that a further unintended effect of the proposition would be that in many cases womens refuges would be the only ordinary dwellinghouses which remained on the valuation roll <e> <s> that could i think lead to the very difficulties of confidentiality about which so much concern was understandably expressed in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should say that the clear preference of scottish womens aid remains for refuges to be left in rating <e> <s> but we discussed it and this solution which it prefers and which the noble and learned lord prefers would not be without its problems <e> <s> it would result in the exemption of certain women from personal community charge liability for the period during which they are solely or mainly resident in a refuge <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house again i do not think that i can return to the box many more times without trespassing on your lordships patience <e> <s> there is a limit to the number of times that i can return on report <e> <s> it is possible to dream up more or less any scenario which could point to complexity <e> <s> i dare say it is especially easy to do so in a bill of this type <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord on the woolsack repeat that <e> <s> i missed the word <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment takes us into the realm of what are sometimes termed secondary uses of rateable values in other words instances where rateable values are used for purposes other than the assessment of rates <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the noble lord is raising a matter which while it is an extremely interesting point probably goes rather wider than anything i should comment on without thinking about the remark that he has just made <e> <s> as i remember from my dhss days we get into very difficult territory when we start talking about all sorts of matters to do with blind people <e> <s> i should not like to respond off the cuff to the noble lord without considering his remarks unless i am able to provide any precedents which i fear from experience earlier in the bill might prove to be difficult for me <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord gray is gaining something of a reputation for producing drafting points <e> <s> all i can say is that i will consider that <e> <s> i should not like to be taken further on it <e> <s> on a quick re-reading of the subsection i do not think that it imparts that meaning to me <e> <s> my noble friend has made the point and i will consider whether there is anything in what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that and i think that the two can run concurrently <e> <s> whether one is in advance of the other at any particular point is something which can be considered as the matter is taken forward <e> <s> however we do not disagree with my noble friend that in the end the need will be to achieve precisely the kind of harmonisation which he seeks <e> <s> i do not think that we are at odds on that point at all and nor are we at odds with the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment which the noble and learned lord has proposed is unnecessary and undesirable <e> <s> it is not necessary because local authorities already have discretion to provide rating <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed this matter quite thoroughly in committee <e> <s> however i noted that whereas the opinion of the committee was taken on the suitablility of a prices index appropriate to local authority costs we are now being asked to consider specifically a local services index the average earnings index and the local government inflation estimates when we consider the group that was agreed with amendments nos <e> <s> and as well <e>", "<cs> my lords my main difficulty with the amendments is that they make an assumption about the financing of local services which in practice i do not believe to be justified <e> <s> if we were to accept the amendments we would be introducing into rating law for the first time the term additional service provision and while i do see the general point which the noble lord lord ross of marnock is making the basic problem underlying his amendments is one of apportioning the cost of local authority services between the non-domestic and the domestic sectors <e>", "<cs> my lords in the interests of time i did not go into a lengthy explanation of how these amendments fitted together <e> <s> i certainly hear what the noble lord says about the difficulties of appeal and i shall if i may study his remarks <e> <s> if i can help him in any way between now and the next stage of the bill i shall certainly do that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the first point i should make in relation to the bulk of the remarks made by the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove which related to the collective charge is that the collective community charge addresses a problem which now presents some intrinsic difficulties <e> <s> the personal community charge system will cope and i believe work well for the vast majority of the population who have a settled mode of existence and who therefore can be registered for the personal community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say first that the amendment raises much wider issues than those which are dealt with by the bill <e> <s> it is not at all clear from the amendment itself how the noble lord lord ross proposes that these services should be financed <e> <s> if however education and possibly other services were not to be funded like other local government services at least in part through the community charges there may be some implication indeed there seemed to be more than an implication in what the noble lord lord ross of marnock said that these services would have to he wholly funded by central government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that we do not accept the exaggerated forecasts of shortfall which have been claimed by many and about which the noble lord is concerned <e> <s> in the first place the community charge registration system will be based on similar procedures to those already in use for electoral <e>", "<cs> my lords i have considered carefully the arguments put forward in support of some form of special taxation arrangement to meet the position where workers living in tied houses who at present have their accommodation provided rent and rates free will be faced with liability for the personal community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords as the bill does not come into effect until april and as we have discussed on numerous occasions we have the prospect of a bill to cover england and wales in the not too distant future i do not think that the noble lords point arises <e> <s> let me continue <e>", "<cs> my lords there would be a minimum time <e> <s> however we are moving away from the main point which i have not yet had a chance to deliver on the question of agricultural workers <e> <s> it is that it will be for employers to decide whether to take account of the personal community charge liability of workers in tied houses in considering the minimum wage they set for and subsequent years <e> <s> i should however point out that any such arrangements would by no means be straightforward if an argument is to be developed that employers should thus meet the personal community charge liability of their employees living in tied accommodation i can envisage that they may also come under pressure to make similar arrangements in relation to employees who do not live in tied accommodation but who will nevertheless equally find themselves with a new personal community charge liability <e> <s> i think that at committee stage i was able to give the figures for such people <e> <s> as the noble lord will know they are pretty substantial <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i apologise for not answering my noble friend <e> <s> it has a bearing in any case on the generality of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> the national trust will continue to be entitled to charitable relief of per cent <e> <s> on non-domestic rates <e> <s> i hope that helps the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i am going to disappoint the noble lord <e> <s> he shakes his head but i hope he will allow me to explain why we cannot do this <e> <s> we considered the point raised by both these amendments during committee <e>", "<cs> my lords we debated the position of students in relation to the community charge very extensively during committee <e> <s> the amendments that are before us today and which comprise a whole group the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside has referred to two of them namely amendments nos <e> <s> and but the group also includes amendments nos <e> <s> a a and to are all matters related to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to those who have commented on these amendments <e> <s> i am especially grateful to the noble earl lord perth to my noble friend lord home and others who have at least accepted that we are doing something which we had not otherwise expected to do <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock drew attention to the remark made by my noble friend lady carnegy about the lukewarm response which some of your lordships were giving to the proposal but that was before the noble lord lord ross spoke when i thought that the reception went rather further than lukewarm and became decidedly icy <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to answer that point and the point raised by the noble lord lord ross about the coverage of the proposals <e> <s> the governments intention is that those paying the reduced charge should be students undertaking full-time courses of education <e> <s> the basic definition will be aligned with that applied by the dhss for the purpose of determining students access to benefits so that the mechanism of the reduced charge applies instead of the possibility of access to rebate <e> <s> those arrangements will be specified in regulations after consultation with local authority and education interests <e> <s> it would be quite impractical to make those regulations within days of the enactment of the bill as would be required by amendment no <e> <s> a tabled by the noble lord lord carmichael <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend was not accurate when he gave that figure because it will depend upon the local authority area <e> <s> my noble friend may have been labouring under a misapprehension <e> <s> all students will have to pay only that per cent <e> <s> of the personal community charge at their term-time addresses so the amount will depend upon the local area <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it may be but i am not sure how my noble friend calculated that figure <e> <s> i shall have to look at it <e> <s> the noble lord may be right that may be how it arose <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord suggested that it was the scottish office but things <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord has totally misunderstood the bill but i must not be facetious <e> <s> the concept of main and ordinary residence which is the form of words that he uses would require definition and that is not there <e> <s> in view of the established position and the electoral registration law by which students may be registered in two places the amendment would not necessarily produce what i thought was the noble lords intention of the home address south of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be the case <e> <s> however i thought it only right to raise the matter now because it is a specific point which has cropped up as a result of the changes for students that we have made to the bill which generally but not entirely seem to meet with approval from your lordships <e>", "<cs> if i have confirmed what the noble lord thought that is a help to me <e> <s> however i cannot agree with the noble lord lord ross of marnock that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that was very much the burden of my remarks <e> <s> i am glad to make that clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the support of all those who have felt that we have moved a long way toward meeting concerns that have been raised about the severely mentally handicapped <e> <s> i am very grateful for the kind remarks that were made by the noble lord lord henderson of brompton and other noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just finish before the noble lord intervenes <e> <s> in relation to the registration officers determination of such an appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> like him i have had a close association in my responsibilities with the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill for about four years <e> <s> much of what the noble lord said ties in with my own views <e> <s> there are problems here <e> <s> that is i think the whole point of putting the extra prescriptive power in the definition <e> <s> i appreciate the connections which the noble lord has with these matters <e> <s> anyone so connected would i think appreciate the difficulties in this area <e> <s> that is why i believe that the matter ought to be cast in the way in which we have cast it <e> <s> this takes care also i believe of the point raised by the noble viscount lord thurso <e>", "<cs> my lords at committee we discussed similar amendments to those which the noble lord has moved and referred to <e> <s> i made it clear that under the proposed future arrangements for revenue support grant it will even if the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i hope that the noble viscount will accept that the point which he has made is surely encompassed by the words which i used when i said that the eventual mechanism will have to ensure that that the concerns which have been addressed by the noble lord lord ross of marnock is taken into account in the calculations in a way which produces fair and reasonable results <e> <s> i cannot conceive for a moment that the concern which the noble viscount raises and indeed the concerns raised by the noble lord lord ross of marnock are not exactly the matters which go towards achieving those results <e>", "<cs> my lords we debated at the committee stage a previous incarnation of the rather more specific amendment in the name of the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> this seeks again to probe the timetable on which the revenue support grant settlement which will of course replace the rate support grant settlement is to be announced <e> <s> as i have said on numerous occasions these arrangements will of course be discussed with cosla and its views on the amount of time necessary between the announcement of the revenue support grant settlement and the determination of the personal community charge will be taken very carefully into account <e>", "<cs> my lords as it stands this amendment will simply leave in doubt the position of the islands councils in relation to the standard community charge <e> <s> it provides that the standard community charge should be due to each local authority in the area of which the premises in respect of which it is payable are situated <e> <s> that implies that there are two local authorities in all areas which as the noble lord lord grimond has accurately described is not the case in the islands <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that the noble lord lord morton of shuna indulges in redrafting at the dispatch box with beguiling simplicity <e> <s> i shall not attempt to follow him down that road <e> <s> however in reply to the noble viscount lord thurso i think that perhaps he has failed to appreciate one or two other elements of the bill <e> <s> the arrangement for setting and paying the standard charges are that each tier sets its own charge but that the charges are payable together to one or other authority <e> <s> that is provided for by schedule to the bill with which no doubt the noble viscount is familiar <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave of the house again i beg to differ with the noble viscount <e> <s> without going on at very great length about this amendment i do not think the noble viscount is right <e> <s> i think it stems from a misappreciation for which i do not blame him one little bit about the way the charge is to be set and the way it will be paid which as i have said is set out in the bill and again in schedule <e> <s> i am sorry that i cannot agree with the noble viscount but i can assure him that what i have said and what my noble friend lord gray suggested describes accurately the circumstances <e> <s> i am also quite content with the drafting although i have to admit that while it provides clarity it certainly does not provide elegance <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may have one more shot at explaining to the noble lord what this means <e> <s> of course i shall take the matter away and look at it <e> <s> however i am not going to give any commitment as to any sort of changes and i hope that the noble lord will feel although he may well not after my further explanation that it makes sense <e>", "<cs> or rather in the case of the island authorities <e> <s> that introduces two different concepts <e> <s> further explanations are being showered upon me <e> <s> i think that the best thing i can do is to write to the noble lord with a lengthy explanation <e> <s> however i do not feel that it will be possible to change this <e> <s> i am happy to look at it constructively and seriously <e> <s> i hope that with that undertaking the noble lord will be happy <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment was originally to be connected with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the effect of the amendments would presumably be to make the standard charge what the opposition have always claimed it is namely a property tax <e> <s> i am in complete disagreement with the proposition that a standard charge is a property tax and i have to go further and say that i am wholly opposed to the proposition that it should be made one by the mechanism of the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the main criteria for application of the collective community charge will be that individual registration of the residents of particular premises would be not practicable <e> <s> one of the other amendments which was originally grouped with this one amendment no <e> <s> which has not been moved would have sought to include that criterion on the face of the bill <e> <s> that would not however have been appropriate <e> <s> the words on the face of the bill that the collective community charge will apply to premises which are used solely or mainly as the sole or main residence of persons most or all of whom reside there only for short periods provide a more precise description of the circumstances in which the collective community charge is to be applied <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment and amendments nos <e> <s> a and c relate to the mechanics of collective community charge arrangements which we have already discussed in detail in committee <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a would provide that the collective community charge multiplier should be subject to a monthly reassessment by the registration officer <e> <s> but this amendment of course goes against the specific provision in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think that part of the difficulty is that this is <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment in a slightly different way would have approached the matter that i believe we discussed on amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> it would provide for the reimbursement of the administrative expenses incurred by landlords in the collective community charge arrangements <e> <s> i do not think i can add to what i have already said but if the noble lord wishes i can repeat my remarks <e> <s> we have discussed the question of whether some form of management fee should be made available to those liable for the collective community charge <e> <s> our view is that it would be more appropriate for such a fee to be expressed as a deduction from the collective community charge liability of the landlord than that an inevitably cumbersome system of reimbursement should be set up <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment and amendments nos <e> <s> and which are connected relate to the requirements that dates of birth and dates of liability should appear in the register <e> <s> the provision that dates of birth should appear in the register was brought forward after consideration of the views of local authority practitioners as expressed through the rating and valuation associations rating forum <e> <s> in order to assist the identification of individuals it is desirable for the register in all cases to record the date of birth of people who are liable to pay any of the community charges <e> <s> in the simplest instance that would allow people at one address who shared the same name to be clearly distinguished <e> <s> more generally however the inclusion of dates of birth will be useful when the identity of an individual has to be checked when he moves from one local authority area to another <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to say that i recognise that the words in the register are not absolutely essential and i am prepared to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i fully understand what is meant by the words the original intention of the entry <e> <s> at the time an entry is made both the registration officer and the person to whom the entry relates will have some idea of its intention <e> <s> if a person to whom it relates thinks that it misrepresents that intention he can appeal to the registration officer and if necessary to the sheriff against the entry and the matter can be sorted out in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in committee this amendment which was also discussed then challenges the logic the fairness or both of providing that if the registration officer has failed to give a determination on a request to make or amend the register entry he shall be deemed to have refused it and that an appeal shall then lie to the sheriff against that deemed refusal <e> <s> the logic of the amendment would turn this presumption on its head and deem it that the registration officer had allowed the request <e> <s> however there is a very simple objection to that approach <e> <s> the provision would not of itself achieve anything since unless a change were made in the entry the register would remain in its original condition and the individuals liability for the charge would be governed accordingly <e> <s> therefore even if it were thought attractive to use this mechanism to provide an incentive to registration officers to give their determinations promptly the amendment of the noble lord would not work <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate that the intention behind the amendments is to make it clear that registration officers can require from registration officers of other registration areas or of local authorities within their own area only such information as these other authorities actually hold <e> <s> i can give the noble lord an unequivocal assurance on that point <e> <s> local authorities and other registration officers will in no case be required to collect information which they would not otherwise collect <e> <s> the provision allows the registration officer to acquire access only to information which these authorities actually have <e> <s> as a matter of drafting the present provisions are quite clear <e> <s> for that reason i cannot accept the amendment which the noble lord proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the concern which has been expressed on this point <e> <s> again i must say that i think it is unnecessary <e> <s> the information which registration officers will require for checking purposes will usually be simply lists of names and addresses <e> <s> where any question of confidentiality may arise however it will be possible under clause to prescribe information which should not be made available to registration officers under the clause <e> <s> we have already undertaken that confidential information held by social work departments or the police should be prescribed under that power <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful if i quickly run over the arrangements provided for by this clause to ensure that there will be a responsible person to provide information about the residence in each set of premises <e> <s> in the vast majority of cases it will be obvious who the responsible person should be <e> <s> he will be the present rateable occupier or in the old-fashioned phrase in the green paper which has been much criticised the head of household <e> <s> he will therefore usually be the owner-occupier or tenant-occupier as provided for in clause a but there may be circumstances in which there is neither owner-occupier nor tenant-occupier on the premises <e> <s> in those circumstances it has to be considered who should be the responsible person <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what has been said in support of the amendment but it seems to me that the amendment would be entirely impracticable since subsection of clause applies only to people who are not already registered and of whose liability the registration officer will be by definition unaware <e> <s> there are separate provisions in clauses and for the registration officer to notify individuals who are the subject of register entries and of whose liability or prospective liability he is aware <e> <s> but when a person arrives in an area and is not yet registered on the community charges register it is obviously impracticable for the registration officer to notify him of his liability <e> <s> for the life of me i cannot understand how he is to find out that the person has arrived <e> <s> that is the practical difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should emphasise first that there is no question of any penalty attaching to someone whose liability for one of the community charges is properly registered but who has simply fallen into arrears <e> <s> recovery of arrears is dealt with separately under clause and schedule to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the intention behind this amendment <e> <s> since when there is any question of a surcharge being imposed on an individual the matter will relate to his registration it seems logical at first glance that it is the registration officer who should be satisfied as to whether or not the person concerned has a reasonable excuse for not having been registered <e> <s> i expect that in practice the levying authority will wish to take advice from the registration officer when it is contemplating imposing a surcharge <e> <s> but i have to say that the provisions of the bill are necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that on that sort of occasion if that were to arise it would be a matter for consultation between the two to start with but ultimately the levying authority should be the final arbiter since the surcharge is due to it along with the community charge itself <e> <s> beyond that i should have thought that it would be a question of appeal to the sheriff against the surcharge in that particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords clause provides that the register should be conclusive on the question of the liability of persons registered to pay any community charge on the date as from which such a charge is payable and on the collective community charge mutiplier in respect of premises registered for the collective community charge <e> <s> all of these points relate directly to the principle or the amount of a persons liability <e> <s> the amendment would add to these provisions the provision that the register is to be conclusive as to the address at which liability is incurred <e> <s> liability flows from residence in a local authoritys area and not residence at a particular address and while the register will of course record the addresses of the persons who are liable the fact or the amount of their liability will not strictly speaking depend on whether they are resident at one address in the local authoritys area rather than in another <e> <s> the amendment is therefore unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the address will appear on the register but the register will not be conclusive as to that address <e> <s> i cannot see that there is need for the amendment in the way that the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should say straight away that paragraph d is a contingency provision <e> <s> at the moment we do not envisage circumstances in which persons other than those listed in paragraphs a b and c should have the right to inspect the register but it might be that in future a need for such a right of inspection will arise and where this was clearly demonstrated it would obviously be highly desirable if the change could be made by regulations rather than by primary legislation <e> <s> in any case the extension of the rights of inspection under this provision would be carefully limited to the extent and the purposes necessary to meet the future circumstances which had arisen <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble baroness says <e> <s> the purpose of the provision is to provide for contingencies <e> <s> things may change in time <e> <s> that is why the paragraph is written in <e> <s> i cannot crystal-ball gaze in the way that the noble lord lord mackie of benshie invited me to <e> <s> obviously there is a strong sense that despite the fact that it is a contingency provision and that it adds flexibility it is flexibility which in your lordships eyes goes rather too far so on this occasion i am willing to bow to those strong feelings and to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see that there is any harm in the provision which the amendment would remove <e> <s> it is no more than a provision whereby persons who could have obtained information from the register by inspecting it will be able to buy that information in a more convenient form <e> <s> there is a similar provision under the representation of the people scotland regulations enabling the electoral registration officer to sell copies of electors lists or the electoral registers <e> <s> those are frequently bought by commercial organisations to which they are very useful <e> <s> as the community charge register will be more up to date than the electoral register and because the provision allows only for the sale of information which is publicly available anyway i expect that the community charge register will be even more useful to commercial interests than the electoral register <e> <s> however i hope that in the light of that explanation and the precedent for it the noble lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i note what my noble friend lord campbell of alloway has said and the purposes for which commercial organisations might use the information which they obtain from either the electoral register which i must tell the noble lord lord grimond is the case at the moment or from the register proposed here <e> <s> it is a matter which goes rather wide of this particular piece of legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of paragraph of schedule is to set out the normal standard arrangements for the payment of community charges by monthly instalments <e> <s> this represents a change from the rating system where the basic arrangement involves monthly instalments <e> <s> the fundamental reason for the difference is that under the rating system liability is determined at the beginning of each year and the precise timetable on which payments are recovered has less significance <e> <s> by contrast the concept underlying the community charge is a continuous liability as recorded in a rolling register kept continuously up to date and it therefore seems more simple to spread the payments throughout the year and to organise them so that equal amounts are due each month <e>", "<cs> my lords as it stands the amendment seems to me to be focused on a fairly narrow point and i am not quite sure that i follow the logic of it <e> <s> if the arrangements which may be made between housing bodies can cover community charge payments by all persons and not just tenants and spouses why should these additional sums which are closely tied to community charge liability not be payable on a similar basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with care to the points that have been raised as i did to the points that were raised in committee <e> <s> i studied those remarks with care <e> <s> i shall not deal with the merits of the matter because they have not been dealt with by any of your lordships <e> <s> the burden of my remarks will be addressed to the points made by the noble lord lord howie of troon and whether the principles should have appeared in the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mackie of benshie asked why <e> <s> the simple reason is that we have only today and monday and i do not see how we can possibly redraft a schedule and put part of its contents into the bill and leave part in the schedule in time for it to leave your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords we considered carefully whether the word closely added anything substantive to the legislation and concluded that it did not <e> <s> the word implies a degree of closeness which can in some way be measured and that beyond some unspecified limit an authority is no longer closely comparable to another one while still being comparable <e> <s> although we believe it is quite possible to compare one authority with another we do not think that the comparisons can be made against a yardstick which permits the kind of test which the noble lord seeks <e> <s> the word therefore does not add to the meaning of the legislation and can quite readily be dropped <e>", "<cs> my lords where the secretary of state proposes a reduction in an authoritys community charge he may take into account an authoritys balances <e> <s> this is being added to the provision repeated from the present legislation that an authority may not compensate for a reduction in <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should make it clear that it is envisaged that every local authority will receive revenue support grant <e> <s> all the calculations made to show how the new grant system will work have been done on that basis <e> <s> the word may is included to cover the remote possibility that an authority might one day have so much income from non-domestic rates and other sources that it would be fairer to give all the grant to other authorities <e> <s> that <e>", "<cs> my lords i was somewhat puzzled by the amendment because it appeared to increase the secretary of states discretion rather than constrain it <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the considerable concern which has been expressed at all stages in our debates on the bill about the governments intention that under the reformed scheme of housing benefits which applies to rates as from st april and on which the community charge rebate scheme will be based everyone should make at least a minimum contribution towards their local taxation <e> <s> we have heard arguments which strike directly at this principle by seeking to increase the maximum rebate to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i shall remark upon it no further <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lady lady saltoun is perhaps better focused in the way that amendment no <e> <s> aa was originally focused but in both cases the general principle at stake seems clear enough <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has slightly misinterpreted my meaning <e> <s> the measure of accountability to which i was referring related to the bill as a whole and the principles enshrined in it <e> <s> if he will allow me to develop my argument a little further i hope he will begin to understand what we are saying <e> <s> when we discussed that package of benefit changes it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i said when i quoted the technical annex to the social security white paper <e> <s> but if the noble lord will bear with me for a minute r shall return to the theme shortly <e> <s> before i do so i pick up a point made by the noble lady when she referred for example to a couple who are unemployed with two children under <e> <s> they are quoted in the document and the noble lady asked what would be the case if the children were over <e> <s> if they were over we should have to add a head which is in total so the income support level rises from the illustrative figure in the table attached to that press notice to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i understand the concern which lies behind this amendment and amendment no <e> <s> b which i believe is connected <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mackie of benshie began his remarks by referring to the highland regional council report <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lady carnegy <e> <s> reading the report leads one to believe that its authors have taken no account whatever of the existence of rebates <e> <s> details of the governments intentions on the rebate scheme and a large number of examples have been available since the bill was published <e> <s> i am frankly surprised that the highland regional council should have made such a remarkable omission from its report <e>", "<cs> my lords yes that is one thing <e> <s> i shall turn however to the debates central theme relating to crofters <e> <s> we discussed the matter at considerable length in committee <e> <s> it was argued that there should be some form of specific relief for crofters and other smallholders from full personal community charge liability <e> <s> nothing that i heard then or that i have heard this evening has convinced me that any general relief of the type proposed by amendment no <e> <s> ab is appropriate <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friends lady camegy and lady elliot that if we went down that road we would receive representations from many other groups of people that they too should be granted similar relief <e> <s> that would make a serious breach in the principle that the personal community charge should be a universal obligation at the same basic level for all <e> <s> and that in its turn would lead to unfairness to others who though no less deserving than those in the favoured groups were unable to argue that their social or economic status justified relief from the personal community charge liability <e>", "<cs> my lords although the amendment would go wider than orkney perhaps it would be best if i responded particularly to the orkney situation <e> <s> i realise from the remarks of my noble friend lord sanderson and also those of my noble friend the duke of atholl that those concerns are uppermost in everyones mind <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of reasons why i consider that this amendment is undesirable <e> <s> first i am not certain what is meant by a decision in principle or its general application <e> <s> as i understand it the court decides the particular case which is before it <e> <s> it does not decide it in principle <e> <s> it may be that certain cases are more important than others in establishing a principle or ratio which can then be applied to different cases but this is not a decision in principle <e>", "<cs> my lords the term crown land in the context of this subsection is not limited to the sovereigns private estates but extends for example to land occupied by government departments as the noble lord realises <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that there were two elements in what i said <e> <s> one was that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence and the other departments which are interested will be consulting about whether any special arrangements for registration or collection of the community charge in respect of the forces are necessary <e> <s> that is one aspect <e> <s> the other aspect which relates to the point made by the noble lord in his concluding remarks is covered by the fact that i also said that my right honourable friend will be reviewing the basis of the assessment of service accommodation charges to see whether changes need to be made in the light of the new system <e>", "<cs> my lords i should explain that subsections and are both well precedented in recent legislation <e> <s> there is a very similar provision to subsection as my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls indicated <e> <s> that similar provision lies in section of the local government scotland act where it states <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall that when your lordships considered a similar proposition at report stage the house took a clear decision that it did not wish to see the bill amended in the way suggested <e> <s> to that extent i am a little surprised to see the amendment tabled <e> <s> i must tell your lordships quite firmly that in the period since the matter was last debated the government have not changed their minds <e> <s> we remain firmly of the view that there is no need to give the secretary of state the power to change the year of abolition of domestic rates from that which is already specifically provided for in the bill <e> <s> we also consider that there would be real disadvantage in accepting the measure of flexibility over the timing which the noble lords lord ross and lord mackie are offering to the government with so much apparent enthusiasm <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may simply say to the noble lord lord galpern that of course i recognise that since the amendment was tabled there has been the announcement of a general election but that does not mean for one minute that it will be impossible to hold the kinds of consultations which are necessary to bring everything into effect under the timetable set out in the bill they will not be prevented from going ahead <e> <s> officials continue and the work of government continues up to the point of the general election <e> <s> i regret that it has not been possible so far for cosla and others to carry on or resume the kinds of consultations with the department on matters affecting the implementation of the bill which we should have liked them to do <e> <s> i had rather hoped that cosla would decide to come forward and discuss this matter <e> <s> i was disappointed by the reports that they are not prepared to do so <e> <s> however i remain entirely confident and i think this answers the point put by the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside as well that once the bill has been enacted cosla and all the other bodies which will need to play a part to ensure that the timetable can be met will come to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to accept these amendments in the name of my noble friend <e> <s> they make useful improvements to subsection of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords again we return to a fairly familiar theme <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock has made clear that his fundamental objection to the community charge is that it is a flat-rate tax to be imposed on all adult residents in a local authority area <e> <s> as i said in committee i am happy to accept that as a matter of terminology the community charge is a poll tax in that sense and indeed to defend its fairness as such <e> <s> so my right honourable frriend the prime minister was quite right in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord carmichael has said and indeed to my noble friend lord campbell and the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> the amendment would make it very much more difficult to establish who would fall within the definition <e> <s> it would in fact extend the definition of the severely mentally handicapped in a quite unacceptable and most unsuitable way <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i very much agree with my noble friend <e> <s> both those matters are printing errors <e> <s> why they should have arisen i am not sure <e> <s> i shall certainly ensure that when the bill is being printed it will be corrected <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and while recognising that this is an area which concerns your lordships i shall not go into the matter of whether or not the proposed amendment will widen or narrow the definition <e> <s> i accept that there could be an interpretation that on the one hand it narrows the definition and on the other hand it most definitely widens it <e> <s> there can be no doubt about that <e> <s> no one wants to see people who may come within the provisions of the bill in the way that my noble friend lord renton suggested when we are dealing with mentally handicapped people not being able to be fitted in <e>", "<cs> my lords we have discussed the standard charge at some length at previous stages and <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house when the noble lord lord ross of marnock puts forward this amendment and connects it with the question of size or value we head straight towards the question of property and hence to property tax <e> <s> it is a feature of suggestions made by some members of the opposition that we ought to retain some sort of tax based on the capital value <e> <s> although it has not been discussed at length in your lordships house certain papers i have seen suggest that this is how the opposition would prefer to see local rates being replaced <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe suggests that there is a difficulty with equity here <e> <s> i am not quite sure how he would justify the fact that rates hills at present have little connection with services that are actually used and whether he suggests there is any equity in that <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am very grateful to my noble friend for this amendment <e> <s> i do not think that it requires further explanation from me <e> <s> i am happy to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can help my noble friend and save us from getting into a laborious argument on this point <e> <s> it is in fact a simple printing error as other noble lords may have realised <e> <s> i apologise that there are one or two printing errors <e> <s> this arose largely from the problem of computer typesetting this print of the bill <e> <s> it is simply a printing error <e> <s> it should refer to subsection and not subsection a and i shall ensure that when the bill is reprinted the error is corrected <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords lord ross of marnock and lord kirkhill referred to the question of those in nursing homes <e> <s> i made it quite clear at col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say straight away that i am more than happy to accept the amendment <e> <s> its wording has been the subject of many ideas and counter-ideas <e> <s> i believe that the wording goes a long way towards reflecting the concern expressed from all quarters of your lordships house <e> <s> that is not only from the noble lords lord carmichael of kelvingrove and lord morton of shuna but also my noble friends lord boyd-carpenter lord selkirk and lord renton <e> <s> i take their concern most seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment touches on two quite different issues <e> <s> the first is the terms of the reimbursement arrangements between the secretary of state and local authorities in respect of the costs of the community charge rebate scheme <e> <s> i should remind your lordships that the present housing benefit scheme is to be revised with effect from / and that the terms of the reimbursement arrangements for that scheme between the secretary of state and the local authorities are currently under discussion <e> <s> the outcome of these discussions will obviously have a considerable influence on the arrangements to apply in / when the community charge rebate scheme will be in place <e> <s> the point is that the community charge rebate scheme will not be created in a vacuum but will follow on from the housing benefit scheme which is currently being revised as i have said <e> <s> there is therefore no reason for providing a different statutory basis for the reimbursement arrangements to apply to the community charge rebate scheme as would be provided for by this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i have said on previous occasions the arrangements for rebating the community charge will be based on the rate rebate arrangements in the new housing benefit scheme to be introduced in april <e> <s> one of the features of that scheme is that for the first time the assessment of entitlement to housing benefit will be aligned with the assessment of entitlement to income support <e> <s> the principle of alignment has been supported by all parties <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not think i can go any further <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of alloway referred to the assurance that i gave about vulnerable groups <e> <s> when i referred to this last time i said that i could not go into the detail because in any case it would not apply until the matter was finalised in the autumn <e> <s> i hear what the noble lord has said but i stand precisely by my answer to him when i spoke the first time <e> <s> to go any further than that now would be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord ross has said his amendment is intended to probe the effect of the statement i made on th may during report stage when at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful to my noble friend for tabling an amendment which certainly removes potential untidiness <e> <s> i am happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord grimond would perpetuate the provisions of section of the water scotland act in certain circumstances <e> <s> this amendment is very similar although not identical to one which we considered at report stage <e> <s> it presents the same difficulties <e> <s> section allows a regional or islands council to meet from the regional general rate up to one third of expenditure on water services not <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i said that i believe the difficulties can be resolved to a substantial degree <e> <s> the fact is that there are some figures which have been produced by orkney islands council which we believe are not necessarily correct <e> <s> we are in discussion with the orkney islands council and we need to have a proper meeting with them to establish precisely where we stand and explain to them why we think that the figures they have produced are incorrect <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to thank your lordships for your kind remarks <e> <s> i have learnt much about the present let alone future methods of local authority financing <e> <s> i can honestly say that for most of the time at any rate i have enjoyed handling the bill from this dispatch box <e> <s> i repeat my grateful thanks to all noble lords for the many constructive comments and good debates that we have had on ways to improve the bill and on others which have not led to change <e> <s> i fully acknowledge the great experience of the noble lord lord ross of marnock even though i could not agree with him at every stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the alliance naturally reviews and updates its rules

realise that we totally condemn apartheid and that it is important that we work in the ways i have described toward its eventual disappearance <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is why we have taken part in the implementation of many different initiatives <e>", "<cs> my lords the present question deals with south africa <e> <s> i do not propose to go beyond that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i made myself perfectly plain when i answered my noble friend lord gisborough <e> <s> the noble lord may have misunderstood me <e> <s> we regularly set out from this box our views on the situation

useful to speculate further than to say that the government as indeed many of your lordships hold very sincerely to the principle that the best way to solve the problem in south africa and to help is by promoting the kind of dialogue that we have regularly advocated from this box and which we shall continue to encourage <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of the military attache the position is

minefield which it may not be profitable for me to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords the important thing is to search for a peaceful settlement <e> <s> i agree entirely with that <e> <s> there is of course security council resolution which is very much the basis for where things stand at the moment <e> <s> as i said in answer to the noble lord lord molloy i believe that perhaps one of the best ways forward would be through the international conference which has been suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords that was precisely why i suggested that it would not necessarily be sensible for me to get involved

did yesterday when i repeated the statement in relation to the iran-iraq conflict <e> <s> as regards progress towards the international conference we support an international conference as a framework

the highest priority to that <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of international fora at present within the of which the trevi is perhaps the most important <e> <s> there are the summit seven the

of the noble lord about the role that my right honourable friend and the government have played in this matter <e> <s> however the idea of umbrellas of different kinds including that of the united nations task force has been floated <e> <s> as i have said we have no objection in principle to a un task force but there are severe practical difficulties <e> <s> for example one difficulty would be obtaining agreement of the security council and the united states and the soviet unions position on that <e> <s> there are other difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> the role of the armilla patrol is to protect british shipping and there are no plans to extend the armillas area of operation <e>", "<cs> my lords the best way to reduce the threat to shipping is to end the conflict <e> <s> as i said in answer to the question of the noble lord lord molloy the government are playing a leading part in moves at the united nations to that end <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally we have to protect our ships in the way that the armilla patrol is doing <e> <s> but iran and iraq remain legally obliged to obey security council resolution including immediate ceasefire at sea as well as on land <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord can say that we are not supporting the united states <e> <s> the important thing is that the freedom of navigation in the gulf is an important principle to be upheld and the armilla patrol which we provide has been there since for that very purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords we have consistently advocated a peaceful negotiated solution to the regions problems <e> <s> we therefore warmly welcome the central american peace agreement and will continue to encourage the central americans to resolve their problems peacefully

right <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords first question about congratulating arias is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords that question has been answered innumerable times from this dispatch box

continue to encourage the central americans to resolve their problems peacefully <e> <s> there is a limit to the number of different ways in which that can be expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not know what else i can say other than that we warmly welcome the central american peace agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no evidence that any countries in the middle east are carrying out such tests <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly signing the non-proliferation treaty would be a valuable confidence-building measure to improve stability in the middle east <e> <s> it would also help to encourage other non-signatories in the region to sign and thereby reduce tension and reduce the chances of a nuclear arms race in the region <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that her majestys government have called upon israel for example to sign the nonproliferation treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case we shall continue to pressure them persuade them and do whatever we can to encourage them to sign that treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords the anc proclaims the legitimacy of the armed struggle <e> <s> we can only be opposed to that <e>", "<cs> my lords when my right honourable and

continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can go further than say what i have just said and that is that we still stand by what was said and what the government committed themselves to at nassau <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that what really counts is what the anc itself says and does <e> <s> perhaps i may refer the noble lord to the statement made by mr makatini of the anc <e> <s> when talking about anc violence he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can go into a subject as complex as this in any greater detail than i have already set out to do <e> <s> we believe that the armed struggle in south africa impedes rather than promotes the cause of fundamental change in south africa and obviously violence can only entrench white attitudes <e> <s> we have always condemned unequivocally indiscriminate acts of terrorism such as car bombings wherever they occur <e> <s> we understand the frustration of the black community but we believe that change must come about by peaceful means <e>", "<cs> my lords i rest on my earlier remark <e> <s> successive administrations have not felt obliged to answer questions of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i very much agree with my noble friend <e> <s> it is quite astonishing that anyone should be alarmed or dismayed by the efforts of the afghan people to defend themselves against the onslaught of a well-equipped and sophisticated modern soviet army <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that her majestys government will be represented at the debate on th or th november <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware in due course of what is proposed to be said on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in danger of straying extremely wide of the question on the order paper which is concerned with export of armaments <e>", "<cs> my lords i return to what i said earlier <e> <s> successive administrations have not commented on matters of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords we are committed to the implementation of un security council resolution and would support an arms embargo against either iran or iraq or both countries if they fail to comply <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that what the noble lord suggests is covered by the answer that i gave and it very much hinges upon the success of the implementation of un security council resolution no <e> <s> <e> <s> i stress that we would support an arms embargo against either iran or iraq or against both countries if they fail to comply with the resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps that is something that my noble friend might exploit privately with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course depends on others than ourselves the soviet union for example <e>

remain in force and they are rigorously applied and they will remain in force whether or not there is also a united nations embargo <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that at the moment we have a security council resolution and we await its implementation <e> <s> if the resolution is not complied with then we would support an arms embargo <e> <s> i cannot conceive that that would be anything other than mandatory <e>", "<cs> my lords iraq as the noble lord said says that she accepts and will implement security council resolution if the iranians do <e> <s> what she seeks therefore is implementation of the elements in strict sequence <e> <s> iran has neither accepted nor rejected the resolution <e> <s> it has agreed to discuss <e>", "<cs> my lords what is of crucial importance is

the noble lord is returning to a question that i answered last week <e> <s> i think he will find that it goes rather wide of a question on the supply of arms <e>", "<cs> my lords our policy is not to become party to binding legal instruments until we are quite sure that they are in accord with other commitments and obligations and we must ensure that the new obligations which these protocols introduce can be fully met <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally we support wholeheartedly any attempts to reduce the inf and note the proposals referred to by the noble lord <e> <s> i think he will be aware

the noble lord is free to speculate i think that the scenario he paints is more than unrealistic <e>", "<cs> my lords i explained that we have every confidence that what has been agreed with the united states is going to go ahead <e> <s> the noble lord may dream up all kinds of ideas as to what could happen in certain circumstances <e> <s> the government do not believe that that is a realistic hypothesis <e>", "<cs> my lords there is already wide international consensus on the need to end the conflict in the gulf i am sure the noble lord is well aware of that and to support

could not believe that it was outside the shielded facility at the sellafield site <e> <s> in a shipment of high enriched uranium coupons grammes per coupon from winfrith to dounreay it was found that one can contained coupons instead of a listed <e> <s> an inquiry concluded that the weight of the evidence indicated that the missing coupon had been loaded into another can and therefore no loss had occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is a serious matter <e> <s> but as i said we believe that the safeguards that we have and at which we continually look are adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords the

first part i think that the noble lord is right when he says that the spotlight will increasingly turn to the conventional after the inf negotiations have been ratified <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of the area i can tell the noble lord that an exact definition of the geographic zone of application has not yet been agreed in the mandate talks <e> <s> the allies view is that negotiations

acceptable arrangements is the best way to take forward the auspices to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> it would be wrong to seek to dictate terms from the outside <e> <s> the two basic principles for settlement are the right of israel and other states in the area to a secure existence and the palestinian right to self-determination <e> <s> deportation is a matter of great concern and we deplore it <e> <s> it is contrary to international law and will only create new martyrs to the palestinian cause and fuel resentment <e> <s> it was unanimously condemned by the united nations security council in resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot go that far but i can say that because the issues are so complex and touch on so much of importance in that part of the world it is important that the parties themselves work out mutually acceptable arrangements <e> <s> an arrangement under the auspices of the united nations may be the best way in the end but at the moment i can go no further on that <e>", "<cs> my lords we move from the arab-israeli conflict to that involving iran and iraq <e> <s> there our policy remains unchanged <e> <s> we are strictly impartial and we have urged both sides to comply at once with security council resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter to be considered should an approach be made for him to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any such approach or that my right honourable friend has made any comment upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the kind of international conference we hope will eventually take place would be to resolve precisely those problems <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will continue to urge the israelis to withdraw from territories occupied in in accordance with security council resolution <e> <s> meanwhile the government will urge them to fulfil their obligations as an occupying power <e> <s> the united kingdom and the twelve have come out firmly in favour of an international conference <e> <s> the united states has not that is why we shall continue our efforts to convince the americans and the israelis as i said earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly true that rebel forces are still fighting against the government in some areas of the north and east <e> <s> they are mostly soldiers from previous administrations <e> <s> however we <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware there is no particular problem about poaching game or entry by the sudanese into the northern area but should there be any further information on that matter i shall let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> my lords president musevenis government in may embarked upon an economic recovery programme with the support of the imf which in itself is an encouraging sign <e> <s> it is a bold initiative which is required and it will require courageous decisions on the part of the government <e> <s> her majestys government have provided substantial aid in a number of different support programmes <e> <s> in june last year we pledged million worth of balance of payments support for uganda to be spent over two years <e> <s> then there are million worth representing a bilateral programme to finance vital imports for the agricultural transport and industrial sectors and million worth of co-financing with the world bank of special facilities for africa <e> <s> the remaining million is subject to uganda maintaining the economic recovery programme to which i referred <e> <s> there are other matters as well <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not have details of the amnesty international report but i shall try to obtain them for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the arms control and disarmament privileges and immunities bill be now read a second time <e> <s> as your lordships will be aware this bill was thoroughly debated in another place last year and carefully scrutinised in committee <e> <s> i do not think this is the occasion for a general debate on the whole range of isms control and disarmament issues to which your lordships have rightly devoted considerable time in recent months perhaps most notably in the excellent debate introduced by the noble lord lord cledwyn on th december <e> <s> i therefore intended to concentrate on the bill itself to set out its purpose and to explain some of its provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i understand his interest in discussing the wider question of the inf agreement and perhaps others and how the provisions will affect the united kingdom <e> <s> however i wonder whether that is perhaps stretching our rules of procedure under standing order no <e> <s> v <e> <s> it may take us beyond the narrow confines of the bill before us <e> <s> perhaps i did not make it plain enough to your lordships that in any case we shall have the opportunity for a more wide-ranging debate when the government take advantage of the provisions in the bill to extend it to the inf inspection agreements and any others which may follow in due course <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will accept the spirit in which i say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i am glad that we all agree that this short bill by facilitating the provisions of the stockholm accord is in itself a small contribution to the breaking down of barriers of mistrust and suspicion <e> <s> the stockholm accord as i have said also provides a vehicle for furthering the aims of other agreements in the arms control and military security field <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier the noble lord lord kennet was straying very wide of the bill before your lordships <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving me notice of his questions <e> <s> the fact that he did so merely reinforced in my mind the fact that his points were wide of the bill <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes it and i think that he does i can now deal shortly with the subjects he raised that are relevant to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in no sense rebuking anyone <e> <s> i was trying to stick to the rules within the procedure of this house <e> <s> however i can give a short answer to many of the points although not within the time-frame that we have allowed for this debate <e> <s> there is a sound procedure whereby any letters written to noble lords on any subject are placed in the library and i hope that that will satisfy the noble lord <e> <s> it is all very well to talk about another place but your lordships house has its own procedures and we must bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i still do not believe that there is the inconsistency which the noble lord seems to think exists <e> <s> the inspection protocol covers inspections in both the united states and the basing country territory <e> <s> the basing country agreement can cover inspections in basing countries only <e> <s> without studying the noble lords remarks in great detail i honestly do not believe that there is the inconsistency to which he draws attention <e> <s> the noble lord indicates that he thinks there is an inconsistency but i beg to differ <e> <s> i shall of course study his remarks to see whether we can reach an accord <e>", "<cs> my lords in his letter the noble lord stated that there was a discrepancy so perhaps i should have used that word and not the word inconsistency <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the second part of the noble viscounts supplementary question we understand that the yemeni government are keen <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to speak about customs in the yemen as regards marriage <e> <s> however fathers generally arrange marriages for their daughters and as with a number of other moslem and african countries it is the yemeni custom for the brides father to receive what is known as bride wealth <e>", "<cs> my lords we have known about the case of these two girls for some time <e> <s> to say that we have taken insufficient action or have not acted timely enough is overstating the matter <e> <s> advice to the families is determined by the girls dual nationality and international convention prevents official intervention when the person concerned is resident in the country of second nationality <e> <s> that point is clearly stated in the note affixed to all british passports <e>", "<cs> my lords with their parents permission the girls were taken to the yemen by an uncle in when they were and respectively <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole matter raises some very complex issues which need careful consideration namely issues of cost and of policy <e> <s> that is why we are undertaking this examination <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot go further than i have said which is that we are giving it considerable attention and priority <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is important in all these considerations to compare like with like <e> <s> the fact is that a revised proposal was brought forward from the bbc in august <e> <s> that followed the november proposal <e> <s> as i said the projects are complex <e> <s> satellite television broadcasting is neither simple nor inexpensive <e> <s> it is not simply a question of extending radio broadcasting <e> <s> the satellite technology involved is still evolving <e> <s> we need to make sure that any investment is a sound way to spend taxpayers money <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the noble lord that the bbcs external services are widely acclaimed <e> <s> the bbc estimates that it has about million regular listeners abroad and that is excluding china <e> <s> as i have said this is a difficult issue and one which is being looked at at the moment but the considerations are complex <e>", "<cs> my lords this proposal is in addition to the existing sound broadcasting <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not see any purpose in discussion of military doctrine in the abstract divorced from military capabilities on which any doctrine must necessarily depend <e> <s> however we see some value in it on the basis of concrete information about the size of each others forces <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the practice of nato as an organisation to respond formally to declarations such as that on military doctrine from the warsaw pact <e> <s> this is a matter for individual members to decide for themselves but as i said the alliance stands ready on certain conditions to address the question in discussions <e> <s> i do not think that i can go any further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> nato is a voluntary organisation of independent democratic nations grouped together for collective self-defence <e> <s> the warsaw pact is none of those things <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be a mistake to equate the two organisations <e> <s> as for the point about verification which the noble lord mentioned that of course goes rather wider than this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is a realistic proposition <e> <s> in any consideration of a matter such as this it is important that we be sure that discussion of doctrines does not merely provide a propaganda vehicle for the east to hammer away at western nuclear policies and to criticise flexible response <e> <s> we must guard against that <e> <s> it is only prudent to establish a sound basis on which the discussions that i have mentioned could take place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a very valid point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that all sorts of things would crop up in the discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords any discussion of doctrine must take second place to the overriding need to launch a new round of conventional stability negotiations currently the subject of informal warsaw pact-nato discussions in vienna as well as further talks on confidence-building <e> <s> that is a very important feature <e> <s> i do not have information on those who might take part under any circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question went considerably wider than the question on the order paper which is concerned specifically <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the practice of nato as an organisation to respond formally to declarations from the warsaw pact <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is important to remember that mr mayor has only just taken over <e> <s> he has a great deal to read up about the important responsibilities he has taken over <e> <s> however we welcome any sign such as the change of director-general which may indicate that unesco is getting back on the right track <e>", "<cs> my lords broadly we need to see clearer signs of the need for change <e> <s> that there is such a need is widely recognised at unesco and fundamental reforms are under way <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will appreciate that the change of director-general important though it is is only a start <e> <s> it is not just a question of personalities <e> <s> the need for wide-ranging reforms remains <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right that funds saved from our former contribution to unesco are now spent specifically on worthwhile educational and scientific schemes of practical value to third world countries <e> <s> we are not convinced that money would be put to such effective use by unesco in its present state <e> <s> the important matter is that we see the wide-ranging reforms to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that it is important that these wide-ranging reforms are taken forward <e> <s> as i have said we are in no way discouraging professor mayor from coming to london <e> <s> indeed arrangements had been made for a meeting earlier this year it was professor mayor himself who unfortunately had to call the meeting off <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord kennet for their response to the statement <e> <s> i am especially gratified that the noble lord lord cledwyn should have stressed as he did the need for a united response over this most important matter both in spirit and in the letter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness appreciates that there are exchanges with the chinese government on a wide range of matters including of course hong kong <e> <s> that is <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord maclehose whose experience in hong kong matters is of course well known to everyone especially to those who live in hong kong <e> <s> i agree that the white paper merits the close study which i am sure the noble lord will give it <e> <s> as regards further study between now and the answer is that there will be no change on that particular issue <e> <s> however through the auspices of the joint liaison group there will be further consideration of how the process up to will be implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier i accept that there will be those who will feel disappointed because they have a particularly strong view that direct elections ought to be introduced earlier <e> <s> but certainly the white paper did not make a commitment to introduce direct elections in it merely noted the state of opinion at that time <e> <s> the white paper undertook to review the position in and that undertaking has been carried out to the full <e> <s> so the options were left open including the possibility of direct elections in <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will accept that a very great deal has happened since the joint declaration itself was signed which was a historic event if ever there was one and the basic law to which the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos referred is being drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is certainly right that an international conference would be a suitable framework for the necessary negotiations between the parties directly concerned <e> <s> as an idea that enjoys wide support <e> <s> we are in close touch with the parties and our partners in the twelve the united states and the soviet union <e> <s> indeed we greatly welcome the renewed united states engagement in this matter which is of course a vital ingredient <e> <s> as for the gulf we continue to support the implementation of security council resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just referred to the renewed united states engagement in this matter <e> <s> we are keeping in close touch <e> <s> assistant under-secretary murphy met my right honourable friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs on th february <e> <s> we look forward to hearing the outcome of mr murphys current contacts in that region <e> <s> that is a positive step forward <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it is important that where possible co-ordination should be achieved <e> <s> however there is no question of supporting or rejecting any proposals at this stage <e> <s> there are many details still to be worked out so far as the proposed international conference is concerned and it is for the parties themselves to reach agreement on whether the initiative represents a sound basis for progress <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we keep in close contact on this matter <e> <s> in the light of the visit which is taking place at the moment it is important that we should consult and hear the views of mr murphy when he comes back <e> <s> however i take note of the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly important <e> <s> however it is for the parties themselves to reach agreement on whether the various initiatives which have been suggested represent a sound basis for progress <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall play our full role in support of any arrangements upon which the parties themselves can agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend has put his finger on a very good point <e> <s> the issues which are involved are very complex and touch on the substance of the dispute itself <e> <s> however the important matter is for the parties concerned to work out mutually acceptable arrangements for any conference <e> <s> it would be wrong to seek to dictate terms from the outside <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly deplore violence from whatever quarter <e> <s> i think that it illustrates the dangers inherent in unresolved conflict and the urgency of searching for a peaceful settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we shall continue to play our full part in support of any arrangements upon which the parties themselves can agree <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence has recently agreed with france to develop opportunities for industries in both countries to supply equipment competitively to both our ministries of defence thus effectively building upon current collaboration <e>", "<cs> my lords this has nothing to do with the united states <e> <s> it is an informal arrangement and the british and french governments have agreed to establish a committee to consider a number of aspects of their defence relationship <e> <s> there has already been one successful example as a result of that initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords this particular arrangement is nothing to do with nuclear cooperation <e> <s> the anglo-french discussions covered a range of issues concerning this particular matter <e> <s> there have also been talks covering nuclear technology and nuclear weaponry <e> <s> the substance of what was discussed is confidential <e>", "<cs> my lords the advantage of this sort of agreement is that money can be saved by preventing wasteful parallel developments taking place <e> <s> as for consultation within nato i cannot give an answer to the noble lord at the moment but i shall find out and advise him <e>", "<cs> my lords we have repeatedly condemned violence in the region in the strongest terms <e> <s> we are opposed to cross-border incursions of the kind that the noble lord has described in either direction <e> <s> a military solution to this issue is unattainable <e> <s> the problems of the region should be settled peacefully through negotiation <e> <s> we support the efforts of both the united states and the united nations secretary-general <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am not in a position to give the noble lord information on the part of his supplementary question in relation <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not get all of the question asked by the noble lord <e> <s> but we support the united states angolan negotiations aimed at reaching an acceptable timetable for the withdrawal of cuban troops <e>", "<cs> my lords in saying that we are opposed to cross-border incursions in either direction i cannot see that anything but good can result from any inference the noble lord might draw about being even-handed as he chooses to call it <e> <s> i do not believe that we are causing any difficulties whatever <e> <s> of course it is right that cross-border incursions of that kind in either direction should be opposed <e> <s> we have encouraged neighbouring countries to seek a peaceful solution of their differences and to co-operate on matters of regional concern <e>", "<cs> approximately yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have that information <e> <s> if the noble lord has i shall be delighted to hear it <e> <s> the important thing is that we should continue to be opposed to cross-border incursion in either direction <e>", "<cs> my lords the important thing is to secure south african withdrawal <e> <s> that is precisely what resolution and resolution which followed seek to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary and my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport at their meeting with their spanish opposite numbers in london on nd december again pressed for the restrictions to be withdrawn <e> <s> we regret that the spanish government were not able to agree to this <e>", "<cs> my lords the restrictions apply to military aircraft not to civil aircraft <e> <s> the spaniards argue that the restrictions are necessary for reasons of national security <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly are <e> <s> my noble and learned friend is quite right <e> <s> we agree that there should be no restrictions of this kind between two nato allies <e> <s> we shall therefore continue to press spain to lift them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are talking about two separate issues <e> <s> this one is specifically concerned with the spanish prohibited airspace and its use by military aircraft <e> <s> other developments on the airport are another matter <e> <s> if the noble lord would like me to pursue it i shall <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not have any effect on civilian aircraft other than civilian aircraft on charter to the ministry of defence <e> <s> the agreements about the airport are reached on the basis of consultation on the future development of civil aviation more widely and within europe <e> <s> the specific problem relates to the use of spanish prohibited airspace by military aircraft <e>", "<cs>

made it clear that we do not intend to impose it on them against their wishes <e> <s> the spanish government have made it clear that they will not begin building a new terminal until the gibraltar house of assembly has acted <e>", "<cs> my lords there may be grave difficulties about that because of the geographical constraints that exist there <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly a view <e> <s> i very much hope that it will be possible in due course to persuade the spaniards to lift the particular difficulty concerning use of spanish prohibited airspace <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that it is possible that there can be a read-across from one issue to the other but i hope that the former will be resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly from this point of view if we had not been able to match as far as we can that which has been done elsewhere then we should be in a much more difficult position than any of the scenarios which have been suggested by the noble lord tonight

around a comparison of statistics particularly when those who use them sometimes do so to make specific points to defend a particular theory and when as has been made quite clear in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not speak for the rumanians <e> <s> the noble lord can address that question to them if he wishes to find out whether or not they are loyal to the soviet union and the warsaw pact <e>

agreements which were reached and which concern united kingdom guidelines have excluded exports of united kingdom continental shelf crude oil to south africa since <e> <s> it would be difficult to be certain that no oil gets through under any circumstances but nevertheless the guidelines which were then established remain firm today <e> <s> i am not sure that i followed the drift of the first part of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> if he would repeat it i should be prepared and happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord reverts to the proposal put forward by the noble lord lord hatch unless i have misunderstood him <e> <s> the answer is that we do not co-operate with that group <e> <s> we disagree with the basis of the question asked by the noble lord lord hatch because the resolution to which it referred was not binding <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord invites me to suggest ways in which we might take stronger measures to prevent the supply and shipment of oil and petroleum products to south africa <e> <s> the existing measures that we have taken are intended to send political signals to the south african government of our strong opposition to apartheid and to the need for urgent fundamental change <e> <s> the noble lord knows full well that further punitive economic sanctions would only hurt those whom we wish to help and furthermore would prolong the conflict <e> <s> he may not agree but nevertheless that is the view of the government <e> <s> it may seem to the noble lord to be a long haul but there are no alternatives to working for peaceful change <e> <s> i recommend it to him <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am concerned about at this dispatch box is to advocate her majestys governments policy not necessarily the policies of other nations <e> <s> what i have said stands <e> <s> we oppose a comprehensive oil embargo furthermore we maintain that the united kingdom guidelines on oil are effective <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seems to have somewhat changed the tenor of his question unless i have misunderstood him <e> <s> what i said is that we have made it clear to oil companies that they are expected to abide by the guidelines of the european community and commonwealth undertakings <e> <s> we would take a serious view of any breaches <e> <s> as i said earlier however there is no evidence to suggest that companies are not complying <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> our national contribution to the united nations relief and works agency whose programmes include supplementary feeding will be million in per cent

supplies and food <e> <s> we are ready to consider requests for special funding both nationally and with our colleagues in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe it to be effective but if we can see ways of improving it we shall use them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is fair to say that not a lot has been forthcoming <e> <s> nevertheless i am certain that they would share in some respects at least the noble lords concern about the conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point of view <e> <s> the lebanon is a matter which concerns us <e> <s> of course we support lebanons

organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware the answer is yes <e> <s> perhaps i should say in amplification of my answer to the noble lord lord mcnair that the united nations relief and works agency does not predetermine the funding levels by area <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> we certainly do not want to see going adrift the money of an agency such as the united nations relief and works agency to which we and our partners donate much for the benefit of these unfortunate people <e> <s> we believe that it is getting through <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i agree entirely with the noble lord <e> <s> i am grateful to him for making that point <e> <s> in fact that agency held a consultation with donors only last week in vienna <e> <s> we await further proposals and its latest plans which we shall also consider sympathetically <e>", "<cs> my lords we share many of the views expressed in professor brzezinskis lecture <e> <s> professor brzezinski drew attention to sources of possible instability in the region and to the effect which it could have on east-west developments <e> <s> we agree with him that the aim of western policy should be to encourage evolutionary change <e> <s> the situation in eastern europe is kept under continuous study both within the government and jointly with our allies and partners <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say to the noble lord that we are paying close attention to developments in eastern europe both nationally and with our nato allies and our european partners <e> <s> this regular process of consultation includes discussion at ministerial level <e> <s> i think that our aims should continue to be to develop contacts encourage reform and better observance of human rights and point out that repression is

negotiations which the noble lord seeks <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always easy to draw instances from other parts of the world and not compare like with like <e> <s> i suspect that that is what the

stringent basis than proposed by the presidency and fourthly provision for the continuation of the united kingdom abatement mechanism <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised to hear the noble lord say that because we have insisted that all controls agreed at the european council must be in legally binding form <e> <s> paragraph of the consolidated conclusion states that quite clearly <e> <s> legally binding texts are now being prepared <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of replacing security council resolution <e> <s> it is a mandatory resolution whch remains in force <e> <s> we are actively engaged in discussion aimed at obtaining implementation of security council resolution <e> <s> this may well require imposition of an arms embargo <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a fact nevertheless that resolution is mandatory and it is underpinned by the unity of the five <e> <s> it has been adopted unanimously it must be obeyed and it remains the best basis for a negotiated settlement <e> <s> we must therefore move to measures to enforce implementation which is what i think the noble lord wants us to do <e> <s> we continue to play a leading part in the discussions in new york as co-ordinator of the five on progress towards an arms embargo <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot tell the noble lord the response of the chinese or indeed go into detail on the discussions which my right honourable friend the secretary of state had with the chinese foreign minister <e> <s> i am not aware of the position at the moment on the question of a mediator <e> <s> a draft document towards an arms embargo is under discussion among the five and it has now been circulated to non-permanent members <e> <s> we are awaiting further discussions <e> <s> there would be no fixed timing as regards any enforcement resolution but the movement towards enforcement must be carefully prepared <e> <s> i think that the noble lord will agree that the unity of the five and the unanimity of counsel are important objectives which would add weight to the resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no short answer to the point raised by the noble lord <e> <s> neither side can expect to continue to flout the wishes of the international community as expressed by security council resolution without serious repercussions <e> <s> we are trying to achieve progress towards the arms embargo which appears to be the best way forward and we in the united kingdom are playing an important part in that <e>", "<cs> my lords the discussions among the five on the now circulated document are precisely about that point <e> <s> we are awaiting further opportunities for discussion and we are as keen as the noble lord to see progress in this difficult matter <e> <s> we shall continue to pursue the matter with all vigour <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know our normal practice is to intervene in such cases only very exceptionally where there are strong humanitarian grounds to do so <e> <s> in the particular circumstances of this case britain and other western governments have repeatedly urged the south african government to exercise clemency <e> <s> we are continuing to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right in saying that people of all parties and of none will feel strongly about the matter <e> <s> it is for that reason that we have acted as we have on humanitarian grounds and i should like to stress that fact to the noble lord <e> <s> he quoted from what he said was part of the judgment but that is not a matter for me <e> <s> we have approached and shall continue to approach the matter on humanitarian grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point made by the noble lord but south africa is no longer a member of the commonwealth <e> <s> i believe that the actions we are taking are as much as we can take and we shall continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his approach and for his support of the action being taken by the government <e> <s> i assure him that we shall continue to make our views known and as always our embassy in south africa is continually active <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord wigoder for reinforcing the point that i made earlier about the importance of approaching the matter from a humanitarian and not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord as i am to the noble lord lord wigoder <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first say to the noble lord that certainly there is no question of a lack of co-ordination between those in the gulf at the moment <e> <s> we share the noble lords concern that the conflict should be brought to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that these proposals were put forward in a way which is by no means complete <e> <s> i do not have a categorical list of the various proposals with me nor do i have a list of the views expressed about them <e> <s> in no sense are the proposals formal in the way that perhaps i may have indicated in my reply to the noble lord lord kennet <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right in many ways <e> <s> what we all want to see is a cessation of the conflict in the gulf <e> <s> any ideas that can promote that and the implementation of resolution would be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important that we try to achieve that result <e> <s> exchanges among the five in new york are continuing <e> <s> it is certainly true that the russians have dropped the link with the work on the arms embargo <e> <s> perhaps the linkage was self-seeking and to some extent unrealistic <e> <s> as i said in my original answer the fact is that there are no properly formulated proposals on the table <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i believe that that is another and wider question <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly not the case that the views of the gibraltarians are being ignored <e> <s> i understand the anxieties of the gibraltarians but the joint declaration gives as much as can reasonably be expected of it considering the fact that the purpose of the committee for which the declaration provides is to co-ordinate the activities of the existing and the new terminals on detailed matters such as passenger and baggage handling <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that a meeting will take place sooner rather than later <e> <s> i cannot say when it will be but i can tell the noble lord that the first step is for the agreement within gibraltar to be made firm <e> <s> that will depend on the election <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is certainly quite right that this agreement represents a good deal for gibraltar <e> <s> it offers the prospect of air links with the rest of europe <e> <s> it will attract more visitors and help tourism and financial services <e> <s> to that extent it will be a major boost to the economy <e> <s> there are also the parallel agreements on the reduction of delays at the frontier and resumption of the gibraltar algeciras ferry service which form part of the total package <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we must await the result of the election in gibraltar but as i said i am sure that whoever wins my right honourable and learned friend will see him before long <e>", "<cs> my lords to some extent that is a hypothetical question but there are major benefits for the united kingdom and the ec <e> <s> the ec aviation liberalisation package would be blocked <e> <s> it would make cheaper air fares more difficult to achieve <e> <s> its passage will secure increased commercial opportunities for british airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intend to give that impression <e> <s> there are regular contacts between the governors office and the gibraltar government the press and the public for example through the chamber of commerce airline companies and so on <e> <s> indeed a written commentary explaining the provisions of the declaration is also available for anyone who is interested so i do not think that there is a lack of information <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall pay our contribution for no later than st december <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we shall meet our obligation in full and we shall not fall into arrears <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that it has been the practice in the past for us to pay per cent <e> <s> of our contribution in the first quarter per cent <e> <s> in the second quarter and the balance in the third quarter <e> <s> that is also the practice of other governments <e>", "<cs> my lords that is something which the noble lord should take up himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i willingly agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> the fao does some excellent work in global famine information and food standards <e> <s> we believe that the fao fails to identify its priorities and its programmes are not all focused on the priority needs of each individual country <e> <s> there is no reason to believe that anything damaging would be caused towards famine relief because of the way in which the money is paid <e> <s> the reason is that the fao at present does not need our money <e> <s> we have taken the money into account in deciding what can be afforded for other programmes this year <e> <s> there will not be the damage that the noble baroness fears <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in line with nearly every country concerned <e> <s> perhaps i may refer the noble lord to section of the foas financial regulations <e> <s> he will see that that section makes it perfectly plain that while contributions and advances shall be due and payable in full within days of the receipt of the communication the regulations also say <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not seek to imply that <e> <s> i hope i indicated that the way in which the money is paid is not going to damage the famine work which the noble baroness mentioned <e> <s> emergency and relief food aid is provided by the un world food programme by the ec and by bilateral aid donors and not directly by the fao <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i gave some criticisms just now <e> <s> i add that it is technical expertise which is often not used effectively because of bureaucracy and bad management <e> <s> in the past information on the organisations finances has not been fully shared with member states <e> <s> the director general has been re-elected for a further period of time and there is every hope that the deficiencies which have been identified will be improved <e>", "<cs> my lords there are others who do not pay their full share and it may be that they have not done so for some time <e> <s> i hope that i have indicated that we support the work of the fao and that is what the question is about <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware the practice to pay it in the way i have described has been the case for many years including the period in office of other parties <e> <s> if the noble lord reads section of the faos financial regulations he will see that while contributions and advances normally shall be due and payable in full within days the regulations are quite clear because they also say <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the question which the right reverend prelate must answer when he promotes the idea of further sanctions is whether or not the sanctions will do what he wants them to do <e> <s> all the experience we have gained from sanctions which have already been applied tells us that they have done the reverse <e> <s> they have strengthened the resolve of certain elements in south africa <e> <s> they have demonstrated to the rest of the world that the south african government are ready to defy the rest of the world <e> <s> there is nothing to suggest that they would not continue to do that <e> <s> they would defy any action which the government may take if we were to go down the road suggested by the right reverend prelate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know how many times i must say it or whether i can say it in any different way <e> <s> i have explained the policy of the government on sanctions <e> <s> we believe that they would be counterproductive <e> <s> they would damage the very people whom the noble lord is so keen to help <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not done the banning nor are we responsible for the detentions <e> <s> that is a matter for the south african government <e> <s> by condemning it in the way that we have we hope that a gradual understanding will dawn upon the minds of the south african government that what they are doing is counter-productive <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly understand the force of that argument <e> <s> however we believe that our acceptance of the optional articles of the european convention provides better protection than the optional protocol <e> <s> indeed the machinery of the european convention is binding upon those who sign it whereas the optional protocol would not be <e> <s> it is of course true that other countries have made the link and ratified the optional protocol but i cannot speak for them <e>", "<cs> my lords the various themes which are incorporated in the european convention and the international covenant are broadly very similar indeed <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will recognise that we are prepared to consider proposals which strengthen the obligations on states contained in international human rights instruments <e> <s> we will of course keep the position on the optional protocol under review <e> <s> however i must say again that we believe that our acceptance of the european convention provides better protection than the optional protocol <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not have the necessary information to enable me to answer the noble lords question directly <e> <s> however that may be a question which would be better addressed to the nations concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords for the reasons that i have already explained to the noble and learned lord i do not believe that by going down the path which he suggests that we should in fact enhance what he and others would like to see so firmly enshrined <e>", "<cs> my lords states have now ratified the optional protocol including denmark finland france iceland italy luxembourg the netherlands norway portugal spain and sweden <e> <s> i also believe that austria and the federal republic of germany are preparing to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble and learned friend is right the situation could lead to confusion rather than assisting those concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that we are discussing with our european partners how together we might take action to secure the release of these people <e> <s> my honourable friend was told in january that many political prisoners had <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that there are estimated to be several thousand political prisoners in ethiopia <e> <s> as regards further pressure in his statement in geneva on th february my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state drew attention to the problem of long-term prisoners in ethiopia <e> <s> the united kingdom representative reiterated our concern in a subsequent statement under the agenda item dealing with human rights violations in any part of the world <e> <s> i cannot say that an inquiry of the sort that the noble lord suggests is entirely ruled out <e> <s> it is perhaps something which i could look at <e>", "<cs> my lords i share entirely the noble lords concerns about the conditions in which these prisoners have been detained <e> <s> of course they have not had a trial <e> <s> as i said in answer to an earlier question we are discussing with our european partners how we can take this forward together <e> <s> the noble lord might be interested to know that one member of the european parliament plans to visit ethiopia soon in her capacity as vice-president of the european parliaments overseas aid committee at the invitation of the ethiopian government <e> <s> she is taking up the case of the royal prisoners and hopes to see them <e> <s> we certainly wish her well in her humanitarian endeavour <e> <s> perhaps i may assure the noble lord that we shall not in any sense diminish our own efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can very well comment on the soviet unions efforts on human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have understood the noble lord he is inquiring about representations we have made at the united nations <e> <s> if that is not so will the noble lord repeat the first part of his question <e>", "<cs> my lords at further suitable opportunities i am sure that we shall <e> <s> i am not sure whether or not immediately is quite the right word to use <e> <s> certainly we shall endeavour strongly to do what we can <e> <s> the aid that we supply to ethiopia is humanitarian and for rehabilitation purposes <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord would want to see that particular work cut down <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can give my noble friend that assurance <e> <s> competition is certainly no way of getting round the high quality assurance standards which of course remain paramount <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord i think that the latter part of his supplementary question is rather wide of the particular and specific question on the order paper <e> <s> nevertheless so far as concerns awacs and the history of that business perhaps the noble lord is aware that that took place before the particular competition initiative began <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is true that there could well still be overcharging <e> <s> however perhaps i can give the house two examples which were quoted in the defence estimates <e> <s> as a result of the competition policy there have been per cent <e> <s> savings on a contract for sonarbuoys on the prices previously paid under single source procurement arrangements and savings of almost per cent <e> <s> over the last non-competitive price in a competition for training missiles <e> <s> i think that that goes some way towards indicating that the policy is effective <e> <s> so far as concerns small firms about small firms have contacted the ministry of defence as a result of the small firms initiative and a number of them have indicated that they are keen to be involved in defence work <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is important that we continue to do that provided of course that the quality assurance is kept up to scratch as my noble friend lady sharpies suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope so <e> <s> there is also of course considerable scope for competition at the sub-contract level which may go some way toward preventing the sort of problem to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give my noble friend the detail for which he asks but i shall find out and let him know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot go into detail on specific contracts but if there is anything that i can find out and let the noble lord know i shall of course do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we deplore the illegal actions such as to those which the noble lord has referred including deportations collective punishment house demolitions and all that sort of thing <e> <s> deportation is contrary to international law and will only create new martyrs to the palestinian cause and fuel resentment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is the concern of all your lordships that we should seek a satisfactory conclusion to what has gone on there for many years <e> <s> we believe that implementation of security council resolution remains the main goal to be achieved <e> <s> as part of the proposal the israelis should withdraw from the territories occupied since and meanwhile should administer its occupation in compliance with international law and human rights standards <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course we greatly welcome the new united states engagement <e> <s> it is a vital ingredient <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary has made that absolutely clear <e> <s> we are keeping in close touch with mr shultz and we hope that he will continue his efforts <e> <s> it is for the parties themselves to decide whether the united states initiative represents a sound basis for progress but we certainly urge them not to reject or stifle this important opportunity for peace <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the right reverend prelate that we have taken up with the israeli authorities a number of individual cases <e> <s> i cannot tell him whether that case is one of them but i shall certainly consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps that is a matter which the noble lord should address directly to the country concerned <e> <s> it is important that this country and this government do all they can to support mr shultz in the important efforts that he is making <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be my noble friends view <e> <s> i have stated before that the plo cannot expect to play a full part in negotiations until it accepts the united nations security council resolutions and renounces violence and accepts israels right to exist <e>", "<cs> my lords if mr shultzs activities are not action i do not know what is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this debate and especially to the noble lord lord irving of dartford for his unqualified welcome of this order <e> <s> as regards the other points essentially they go rather wider than the very narrow issue with which the order is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords it was for the dalai lamas representatives to do that <e> <s> they gave the undertakings and it was for them to interpret them <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will note that the dalai lama himself stated at one of his press conferences that press reports of that alleged gagging had been exaggerated <e> <s> i hope my noble friend is also aware that the dalai lama gave a large number of interviews including those on television without any hindrance <e>", "<cs> my lords there was no discussion between my right honourable and learned friend and the dalai lama <e>", "<cs> my lords in case the noble lord misheard me i should perhaps repeat that no discussions took place between my right honourable and learned friend and the dalai lama <e> <s> with regard to representations her majestys government are concerned and regret the loss of life and injuries which have taken place <e> <s> both my right honourable friend the prime minister and my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs made clear to the chinese foreign minister mr wu during his visit the strength of feeling about the matter that existed in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords no it is not the position <e> <s> the position is as i described it in my original answer <e> <s> assurances were from the outset offered on the dalai lamas behalf that his visit would be pastoral in character and that he would not make political statements while he was here <e> <s> in those circumstances no consideration was given as to whether such assurances should be insisted on as a condition of his visit <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is for me to answer hypothetical questions <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the readmission or otherwise of fiji to the commonwealth we also hope that it will be able to rejoin as a republic <e> <s> however admission depends on the approval of all members of the commonwealth and not any single member <e>

certainly discussed and dr puapua expressed his appreciation of everything we are doing <e> <s> aid amounts to about half a million pounds a year <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is not at the present time <e> <s> however i note the noble lords interest <e>", "<cs> my lords the european community already provides substantial aid to central america including nicaragua <e> <s> the united kingdoms share is about per cent <e> <s> the recent san jose conference in hamburg agreed to additional measures to assist the countries of the region several of which have suffered severely from internal conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not have a bilateral aid programme for nicaragua but the government have contributed to joint funded projects carried out by the voluntary agencies <e> <s> those are the kinds of things to which the noble lord alludes <e> <s> those projects are mainly humanitarian and are designed to help the poorest people in nicaragua <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that question is that we have not progressed quite so far as the noble lord indicates <e> <s> we hope that it will be possible to make further progress and move forward from the recent meeting which was held on th april <e> <s> there is to be another meeting on th may <e> <s> we are still in the position of wishing to see a peaceful negotiated solution to the regions problems <e> <s> i hope that it will be a successful negotiation and that we shall make progress after that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is to take forward the meeting which took place on th april which comprised talks in managua about a definitive cease-fire <e> <s> the parties met on th april but the contra leaders found the sandinista proposals unacceptable because they required them to lay down their arms without prior guarantees that the sandinistas would implement further democratisation <e> <s> there is to be a further meeting on th may so the process is still very much alive <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have yet to reach the ideal position which the noble lord wishes to see <e> <s> we have consistently advocated a peaceful negotiated solution to the regions problems and we warmly welcome both the central american peace agreement and the -day cease-fire agreement which was signed on rd march <e> <s> as i have said negotiations are still under way <e> <s> let us see how they develop <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not laying down any conditions whatever <e> <s> i stated that at present there is no bilateral aid programme for nicaragua <e> <s> however as i said the european communitys aid commitments to central america are substantial <e> <s> they doubled from million european currency units in to million european currency units in of which the united kingdom contributes about per cent <e> <s> at the san jos conference it was agreed to demonstrate the european communitys practical support for the peace process namely through additional food aid help with refugees and assistance for the proposed central american parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must not confuse the humanitarian aid side with the bilateral aid side <e> <s> as i have said we already contribute to joint funded projects carried out by the voluntary agencies <e> <s> no doubt we shall continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in our discussion on

<e> <s> we are striving for that at the moment but that is precisely why our efforts must lie in icao <e> <s> i cannot say whether it will be possible to put this forward at the next meeting but certainly those two factors go a long way towards meeting the noble baronesss point <e>", "<cs> my lords we understand the motivation of those who wished to save the lives of the people on the aircraft and we were relieved that the remaining hostages were freed unhurt <e> <s> however we regret that the terrorists seem to have been allowed to go free <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall have to hope that the last point of the noble lords supplementary question is achieved <e> <s> on the outcome with our european community colleagues foreign ministers of the twelve agreed on th april that counterterrorism experts should meet soon to examine the hijacking and its aftermath <e> <s> our proposals were discussed by an icao sub-committee on th april and th may <e> <s> the united kingdom representative was asked to provide a paper for further substantive discussion in early june and we shall follow closely discussions in icao and are pressing ec and summit seven partners to support

bangkok airport <e> <s> i am afraid that i can go no further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should imagine that they are legion <e> <s> however i can only report the result of the thai authoritys investigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my right honourable and learned friends five-point plan goes a long way to addressing that particular matter <e> <s> however there are already a number of relevant international conventions to deal with international co-operation on aircraft terrorism such as the tokyo convention which required states to take all appropriate measures to restore unlawfully seized aircraft which land within their territory to lawful control <e> <s> there was also the hague convention and the montreal convention which are also concerned with ensuring that offenders are brought to justice <e> <s> the international civil aviation organisation also produced guidance on responses to hijacking <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> it is all very well having such conventions but of course it is most important that they should function properly <e> <s> that is precisely why my right honourable friend put forward a five-point action plan which covered many of the matters which concerned all of us and which we hope will lead to preventing the repetition of such a terrible incident <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what the procedures are designed to achieve <e> <s> there are a number of different possibilities which we encourage <e>", "<cs> my lords i can go no further than to say that the investigation in thailand showed that the

acutely conscious of the gravity of the crisis facing hong kong <e> <s> we are in close contact with the hong kong government on a way forward <e> <s> indeed my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary will have this matter high on his agenda when he visits hong kong later this week <e> <s> but the root of the problem lies elsewhere as i think the noble lord will recognise <e> <s>

declaration on the future of hong kong provides for continuation after th june of hong kongs present social and legal systems <e> <s> any refugees then in hong kong should thus retain their current status <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble viscount is that these people are not being expelled they are choosing to leave under their own volition <e> <s> but naturally the fault for that

possible should make some contribution towards the costs of the local services from which to some extent they benefit <e>", "<cs> to reply first to the noble lord lord jay about legal obligation we have yet to reach the part of the bill that commences in clause which <e>", "<cs> that will be done by order under that schedule and it does not feature in the schedule <e> <s> however clause paves the way for that part of the schedule to take effect <e> <s> my right honourable friend has stated that orders would be made under the schedule <e>", "<cs> i seem to have been down this path before with the scottish bill last year when the same arguments were put forward <e> <s> the fact is that the same applied there and there is absolutely no suggestion that the appropriate orders will not be made <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord is not suggesting for a minute that that is not the case <e> <s> of course the orders will be made <e> <s> that is the correct place to make the orders to bring into effect this per cent <e> <s> rebate <e> <s> that is why it is being done in this way and is not put on the face of the bill itself <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble baroness i am not sure that that is the case <e> <s> if we had not uprated benefits by the average amount i am sure that we would have been criticised for not going as far as we have indicated we shall do <e> <s> as regards the point which was made about cardboard boxes i believe that that is the subject of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i know that my noble friend lord caithness will wish to speak on that amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can deal with the matter speedily and reassure the noble lord about his amendment which as he explained seeks to give a three-month period of grace to people who become subject to the standard community charge as a result of moving house <e>", "<cs> the noble lord should not suggest that we change one to make england different from scotland <e> <s> that is far from the situation <e> <s> we have made clear on many occasions that the three months figure is that which exists <e> <s> i see no reason to suppose that scotland and england should be separate <e> <s> as i said this reflects different approaches to drafting <e> <s> as the noble lord will know and as i begin to discover when i tackle an english bill after a scottish bill in quick order there is no difference of intent it is a matter of drafting <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord and i have discussed this many times previously we must not become too bogged down in the technical differences that arise on drafting <e> <s> the intention is the same <e> <s> i cannot say that for all time there will be no change or that they may not coincide at any particular point but i assure the noble lord that there is no intention to have any difference <e> <s> if there were i should not have given the earlier assurance <e>", "<cs> i am happy to consider whether we can examine the scottish act in the light of the passage of this bill in regard to the need for some amendment <e> <s> i do not necessarily hold out any hope that that will be the case <e> <s> we often have this kind of discussion when there is a slight difference between the way in which an english bill is drafted and the way in which a scottish bill is drafted <e>", "<cs> the difficulty in what the noble lord proposes is that not only would we be faced with altering this bill or indeed the scottish one but a host of amendments would be necessary to various measures already passed in another place reflecting slight differences in the way in which the english and scots approach issues <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has described how his amendment concerns people living in tied accommodation and he has cited a number of examples <e> <s> those people who have a separate property which they intend to use as a retirement <e>", "<cs> i shall endeavour to enlighten both my noble friend and the noble lord opposite <e> <s> perhaps i may start by saying that i have considerable sympathy with the intention behind the amendment <e> <s> i accept that hardship may arise where a person becomes resident in a hospital or residential care home and leaves his or her previous home vacant <e> <s> in the long term one would expect a person in those circumstances to sell his previous home thus extinguishing any standard community charge liability <e> <s> however that may not always be possible either because of difficulty in selling the home or because the person wishes to return in due course <e>", "<cs> i think that that would be a matter for the local authority the charging authority to determine <e> <s> my proposal suggests that that charging authority should have discretion to set the standard charge mutiplier of zero if it felt that that was the right way to proceed within its local area for the properties it feels should fall within that separate class to meet special needs <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord repeat that question please <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord is not suggesting that i am threatening any particular amendment to the bill <e> <s> i understand that the regulations will be made under clause <e> <s> the noble lord is correct <e>", "<cs> the mind boggles <e> <s> i should like to correct one point which relates generally to the discussions that we have had and to the matter raised by the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> as i understand it the powers that would be used in this specific instance in the way that i have described would apply only to a whole class of property about which the local authority would not be able to decide case by case <e> <s> indeed that would not be desirable <e>", "<cs> if there is the concern that the noble lord has expressed that local authorities may not be able adequately to safeguard all those concerned and i recognise the force of the argument he has put will he agree that this might be <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is not arguing that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is arguing two points <e> <s> they overlap to a certain degree but not entirely <e> <s> there are two different kinds of orders that can be used to give discretion <e> <s> one is by the local authority <e> <s> that is what i described when i responded to the amendment of the noble lord <e> <s> i was going to make another suggestion that i hoped would go further and would impose more of a duty upon the secretary of state <e> <s> i am not content to impose further duties upon the secretary of state if that is not what noble lords opposite wish <e> <s> however i still believe that ultimately the responsible way to tackle this is through the local authorities <e> <s> they know their people and have a responsibility towards the people in that area <e>", "<cs> i have not placed myself on a hook <e> <s> there is a perfectly valid argument to support the case that this discretion should be given to the local authorities <e>", "<cs> it is not what the bill says but it is precisely what i said when i answered the amendment of the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> i made it perfectly plain that we were not prepared to follow his amendment but to give effect to what he proposed by specification in regulations under clause <e> <s> clause and give the power to charging authorities to set multipliers <e> <s> that is <e>", "<cs> i should like to point out to the noble lord that it is important we get this right <e> <s> it is not just a question of taking the matter away and leaving half the arguments unanswered <e> <s> the noble lord will read <e>", "<cs> if i may finish my argument which i have tried so far twice to finish and the noble lord has not allowed me to do so what i should be prepared to do would be to propose that the secretary of state should use his power under clause to set a standard charge multiplier at zero in these cases across the board <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should intervene to try and straighten out this matter because i believe that the noble lord lord monkswell is labouring under something of a misapprehension <e> <s> as i understand it it is not possible to vote in two places on the same <e>", "<cs> in the interests of time i hoped that i would be able to get away with a very brief introduction <e> <s> however the noble lord has tempted me and i shall therefore endeavour to explain it <e>", "<cs> the short answer to my noble friend is no i cannot <e> <s> i have to say that for once i thought we had a relatively straightforward amendment <e> <s> it just shows what pitfalls there arc when one imagines that that is the case <e> <s> i wonder whether i can take on board the point of the noble earl lord lytton <e> <s> i honestly do not know the answer to the point he raised <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton of shuna is at least a scottish lawyer but i am no sort of lawyer and i do not think i can go into the detail of it now <e> <s> i believe it to be straightforward <e> <s> what i should like to do is give the assurances for which noble lords have asked me when i have read in <e>", "<cs> no i rather hoped that the noble lord might take me as being at least honest in this matter <e> <s> i believe it to be perfectly clear so far as english lawyers are concerned <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept the principle of it and that i may indeed move the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should preface my remarks by saying that while i am sure that my noble friend is well intentioned he is labouring under a serious misconception about the collective community charge <e> <s> that charge is not a family charge as he has suggested <e> <s> it will apply only to properties such as hostels night shelters bedsits and so on which are in multiple occupation and where residents come and go fairly frequently making individual registration impractical <e> <s> the collective charge will not apply to any stable family living in its own home <e> <s> he has started off on the wrong foot <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt my noble friend to say that such may be his view but in point of fact that is not the result of the amendments that he has put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right when he refers to the report <e> <s> we are ready to do more so far as concerns population programmes but our bilateral spending is dependent on recipient governments giving population a high priority in their plans <e> <s> perhaps i should say to the noble lord that support for population-related activities has already doubled from million in to about million in <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend that specific guidelines on women in development policy have been issued to oda departments and development divisions for implementation <e> <s> we are looking to improve our performance on that issue during <e> <s> my noble friend has made a good point <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble baroness lies in two directions <e> <s> first we have the aid programme in its wider sense and within that we have the other aid which is specifically for population-related activities <e> <s> there are also aspects which take account of the environment which i believe is a facet of the original question of the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> so far as concerns the united nations fund for population activities in we gave million which represents a per cent <e> <s> increase over <e> <s> in fact we are the ninth largest contributor <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a continual dialogue between the western countries about these problems <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that we shall play our part fully <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs mr eggar will meet the director general of unesco during his visit to london on nd june <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly welcomed the election of a new director general as a step in the right direction <e> <s> as the noble lord says there have also been some positive signs under senor mayors direction of a change in atmosphere at unesco <e> <s> we hope that this will give impetus to the reform process which made little progress during and <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh for his understanding that there is nothing sinister in the amendment and that it is designed to be helpful and to remove the existing anomaly <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i missed that point <e> <s> perhaps i can assure the noble lord that subsection a is simply intended to deal with the period during which the co-ownership subsists <e> <s> the words in brackets simply make it absolutely clear beyond doubt what is meant by the period of co-ownership <e> <s> the noble lord may find those words rather confusing and may not find them in other statutes as he was unable to give examples but i assure him that those words would be absolutely clear before a court and that is what we are keen to ensure <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i am afraid that i shall rise to that bait <e> <s> the noble lord has sought to challenge various aspects of this bill <e> <s> wherever possible the government have done all they can to improve it <e> <s> that is the purpose of this committee stage <e>", "<cs> i certainly accept that the affirmative procedure can be a useful check on the exercise of the power of the executive <e> <s> however i do not believe that its use would be as appropriate as the noble lord suggests it might be in the case of schedule <e>", "<cs> perhaps what the noble lord has missed when he refers to sole liability is that everyone has sole liability in their own right <e> <s> therefore it does not exclude married couples <e> <s> as far as i remember this was a feature of the scottish bill <e> <s> as regards amendment no <e> <s> a and the reason the regulations provide that they should pay only in the area in which they were first registered which i believe to be the noble lords second point that was an arbitrary decision for simplification and no other reason <e>", "<cs> the noble lord might be very well advised to complain <e> <s> the fact is that his situation is not dissimilar from that of many of us including me <e> <s> it will be up to the noble lord and the registration authorities to decide which is the noble lords main residence <e> <s> for example if he decides that his home in east anglia is his main residence then upon his flat in london wherever that might be he would be subject to the standard community charge <e> <s> it will be for him to resolve with his local authority which is the main residence <e> <s> the other would be liable for the standard charge <e> <s> i hope that clarifies the position <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble baroness would expect the community charge registration officers to be reasonable people <e> <s> it would be up to an individual to take up a case with the registration officer to establish at which of his two residences he spent more time <e> <s> one can move into the realms of hypothesis with these matters but it is the registration officer who decides subject to the right of appeal <e> <s> however the individual can make his case to the registration officer in the way i have described <e> <s> this will be a fairly common feature for many noble lords who like my noble friend lord renton will have a house in one part of the country and a flat in london <e> <s> it is up to the individual to sort this out with the registration officer <e> <s> the circumstances will vary from one person to another but i do not think that it need be as complex as the noble baroness fears <e>", "<cs> i believe that to be impossible <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point <e> <s> this was picked on arbitrarily because it seemed sensible <e> <s> i should like to look at that point <e> <s> i imagine that in the case of two authorities which claimed that one place was to be the sole or main residence the two registration officers would be able to get together with the aid of the individual concerned <e> <s> however if making this arbitrary choice has compounded the problem i should like to look at those words <e> <s> i do not believe that it has but without commitment i shall certainly look at the matter <e>", "<cs> part of the problem might be that from time to time the pattern of peoples lives will change <e> <s> for example i spend most of my time in london and can legitimately claim i suppose that my sole or main residence is a small flat in london <e> <s> what i regard to be my home is very much my second home because i am hardly ever there <e> <s> however things may change and i may find myself spending more time in scotland than i do in london <e>", "<cs> noble lords opposite may wish that to be the case as i rather anticipated they might <e> <s> at any rate it has not happened yet <e>", "<cs> everyone will be subject to the charge and the charge will be very different from capital gains tax or anything like that <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton of shuna put his finger on the point <e> <s> there could be a large financial advantage in any claim <e> <s> we think it is best to let the community charge registration officer decide subject to appeal but the individual concerned will be able to make representations to him <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to the remarks made by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> both amendments seem to give the impression to me at any rate that the noble lord has an unnecessary fear of allowing local authorities to have discretion in their arrangements for collecting the community charge <e> <s> under sub-paragraph b the government will make regulations giving every charge payer a right to pay in no fewer than monthly instalments <e> <s> however the crucial point is that that will be subject to any agreement that may be reached between the authority and the individual charge payer just as is the case with the present rates system <e> <s> the agreement may be to pay in only two instalments in a single lump sum or weekly or fortnightly <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has tabled an amendment to give magistrates the power to remit payment of the community charge on the grounds of poverty <e> <s> he has proposed this in an amendment to schedule to the bill <e> <s> enforcement of payment is dealt with in schedule which sets out the role of the magistrates courts <e> <s> paragraph c of schedule already allows magistrates to remit payment in certain circumstances <e> <s> i hope that in the light of this the noble lord will take it as confirmation from me that the commitment which was given in another place has been carried out in that sub-paragraph <e> <s> i hope that that is the reassurance which he seeks <e>", "<cs> yes the amendment which we are talking to is to schedule page line <e> <s> for amendment no <e> <s> b it is line and for amendment no <e> <s> c it is line <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if in a moment the noble lord would repeat the point that he wished me to look at and the actual place in the bill <e> <s> we have slightly jumped ahead of ourselves <e> <s> we are now debating schedule to the bill <e> <s> the amendments put down are to schedule <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal will agree that we can discuss the important point about the attachment of earnings that she made when we come on to the amendments which relate to that point <e>", "<cs> this is where i have to confess that i am placed in a rather awkward position <e> <s> as i understood it this amendment was debated yesterday indeed i understood that it had been accepted <e> <s> i find myself in difficulty because i did not deal with the amendment concerned <e> <s> i dare say i should be as familiar with this part of the bill as i have become with other parts of the bill <e> <s> at the same time i hope that the noble lord accepts that since my noble friend lord caithness is not here my attempts to answer the point may be rather amateurish <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may do as the noble lord lord mcintosh has invited me to do bearing in mind at the same time the point made by the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> he is right to say that the data protection act on the whole deals with computer material rather than manuscript material which might mean amendment of the data protection act <e> <s> however perhaps i may follow the advice of the noble lord lord mcintosh and study what has been said in order to pass it on to my noble friend and to my right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> we can then correspond on the issue <e>", "<cs> perhaps that goes even more widely than the noble lord lord monson has suggested <e> <s> it may be the case that an individual has property in some form in the house in which he lives <e> <s> that is where the question of distress will come in <e> <s> that is one of the gradations of response to someone who may not be prepared to pay the community charge <e> <s> as i understand it we are interested in the matter of income from capital and not property cash or anything that forms part of overall capital but does not provide income <e>", "<cs> then surely we get to the next point but one of the bill <e> <s> we first have the matter of information which has to be supplied then we have attachment of earnings and then we have distress <e> <s> someone may hold property or something like that <e> <s> he may as the noble lord lord morton suggests be a gambler <e> <s> he is a lucky man if he is able to make a living out of it <e> <s> but if he does and he has property and is not declaring which he may not have to do the earnings from his gambling he will nevertheless be liable ultimately for distress in the terms of paragraph <e>", "<cs> this may be the point at which we must have a disagreement <e> <s> as i understand it income from capital is the important feature here <e> <s> i am not familiar enough with the laws on gambling which the noble lord raises and on tax law the noble lord must listen and allow me to develop my argument a little before the looks in horror as if he wants to respond and i am in no position to tell him whether or not any individual would be liable for tax on what he gets from gambling or anything else <e> <s> the point is that we are only dealing with income obtained from capital and as i have said most people will have income from that capital <e> <s> nevertheless it seems to me that the best thing i can do is to study the noble lords remarks <e> <s> i certainly cannot give a commitment that i shall be able to bring back an amendment but i should like to study his remarks <e> <s> perhaps he will allow me to do that <e>", "<cs> with respect i did not say that i would take it away <e>", "<cs> we will certainly think about it <e> <s> i will look at it and see what the noble lord said in detail and whether there is a point there <e> <s> i do not believe there is because as i have said as the matter goes through its procedure we ultimately get to distress which deals with the points that the noble lord made <e> <s> paragraph is about the local authority and not about the magistrates court and the court has already granted the necessary order <e> <s> i shall read what the noble lord said <e> <s> i hope he will nevertheless agree that the amendment should be agreed to <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall be able to persuade the noble lord lord morton of shuna not to press this amendment <e> <s> there are two straightforward reasons <e> <s> in the first place i doubt whether in practice it would be of much use to charging authorities <e> <s> secondly if it were to prove of any use it would undermine the detailed enforcement procedures in the rest of schedule <e>", "<cs> i hope it is clear from paragraph of schedule that the government recognise the need for close control over the operation of the rules for attachment of earnings in community charge cases <e> <s> we shall exercise that control in the regulations envisaged in paragraph <e> <s> one of the regulations will deal with the maximum amount of earnings that can be deducted for any level of income <e> <s> our regulations will be very much more sophisticated than the or per cent <e> <s> maximum approach of the noble lord lord mcintosh which incidentally takes little account of ability to pay <e> <s> we have not yet settled the figures that will be proposed in our regulations <e> <s> if the noble lord would like an indication of the amounts we have in mind i would refer him to schedule to the debtors scotland act <e> <s> i have those schedules with me but they are fairly lengthy <e>", "<cs> i can almost immediately give the noble lord those schedules <e> <s> among other things they will apply to deductions for attachment of earnings in the case of non-payment of community charges in scotland <e> <s> we envisage that no deductions should be permitted for earnings up to a threshold level <e> <s> that is the right approach <e> <s> there are amounts of earnings so small that only deductions less than those implied by the noble lords amendment should be allowed <e> <s> conversely where people have large disposable incomes they should be expected to pay off much more quickly the debt they have incurred <e> <s> two per cent <e> <s> of net earnings is in those cases far too low <e> <s> for earnings over a week for example the debtors scotland act envisages deductions of a week in respect of the first plus per cent <e> <s> of the remainder <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord does not have the schedules with him but on the basis that that is the amount we have in mind i hope he will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the answer to that is that we do not necessarily propose to use precisely the same figures <e> <s> what i hoped to indicate was the kind of figures that we would be talking about <e> <s> it is perhaps a ball-park figure but it will follow broadly those lines <e> <s> that is the nearest parallel that i can give the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord described the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> i will start by repeating the basis of the quotation that he gave when he began his remarks <e> <s> we believe that there should be equality of treatment wherever possible between those who are in employment and those who are receiving benefit <e> <s> attachment of earnings will be available for defaulters who are employed and there is therefore a strong argument that similar arrangements should apply to those people receiving income support who do not pay their community charge <e>", "<cs> that may be the case <e> <s> i am not an expert on where camden spends its money <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness is quite right that a lot of what is spent is valuable i doubt whether it is all necessary <e> <s> but i do not think we ought to be getting into the semantics of arguing about a particular local authority area <e> <s> it may not be semantics but it is politics <e> <s> the noble lord said it himself and it is politics as regards that borough <e> <s> the fact is that there is a system under which the additional amount will form part of peoples benefits <e> <s> it will be included in their income support to reflect that they will have to pay that amount <e>", "<cs> in the view of the government it is entirely right that there should be proper procedures for resolving disputes of that nature <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to persuade the noble lord that the amendment is unnecessary because further provision will be made elsewhere in the bill <e> <s> paragraph c makes provision for cases where there is an irregularity in the execution of a distress <e> <s> such a irregularity might occur where the wrong persons goods are seized <e> <s> the provision will enable the aggrieved person to take proceedings in the county court and to recover compensation <e>", "<cs> i recognise the good intention which lies behind the noble baronesss amendment but i hope i can persuade her that it is unnecessary indeed inappropriate <e> <s> rent is of course charged by a variety of landlords the vast majority of whom are responsible and who as creditors could be expected to be careful in whom they employ as bailiffs <e> <s> nonetheless there is rightly concern over a few unscrupulous landlords who might hire disreputable bailiffs to execute distress warrants <e> <s> it is only proper therefore that some <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce has set out clearly why he believes that imprisonment on civil debts under any circumstances is as i understood him to say unacceptable <e> <s> i must say that the noble and learned lord will be aware that i am particularly conscious as a result of my earlier days at the home office of the problems of overcrowding in prisons <e> <s> i am well aware of many of the facts which he brought before us this evening and he was supported by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones in doing so <e>", "<cs> i understand that point of view but the fact is that taking for example the people who were committed for non-payment of rates in i understand and i know this from my personal experience in the home office in dealing with prisons that those people spent only short periods usually a matter of days before they agreed <e>", "<cs> with respect i can deal with the position in scotland in a moment as i was coming to that and answer that point together with the point put by the noble lady lady saltoun <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness raises a point which is entirely valid <e> <s> in due course as part of a general review of debt recovery arrangements in england and wales for that is what it would need to be if it was felt appropriate to match the powers available in the debtors scotland act then the presumption would be that those wider recovery powers would mean that imprisonment was no longer needed in england and wales <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure what point the noble lord is making <e>", "<cs> perhaps it will <e> <s> that is the purpose lying behind my reply to the question from the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> the fact is that the procedures probably have existed in scotland for years but not in england and that is why we find ourselves in the present position <e> <s> if the situation were reviewed in due course account would need to be taken of civil debt collection much more widely than the ambit of this bill now before the committee <e>", "<cs> yes in answer to the noble ladys point there is no intention to amend <e> <s> the amendment would be the other way round if we had a general review of debt recovery arrangements in england and wales <e> <s> it is by virtue of that process that we would get to a stage ultimately similar to that which exists in scotland <e>", "<cs> the answer is that it is a matter which requires much consideration in just the same way as it did for scotland <e> <s> the scottish law commission published its report in <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord morton of shuna has answered the noble baroness question by saying that some of it was there <e> <s> however if it had all been there the law commission would not have had to report on the situation in the first place <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has asked me whether i can agree to consider the matter between now and report stage <e> <s> while i understand the concerns of the noble lord i must say to him that it would be impossible for me to give such an assurance <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot give even that assurance <e> <s> i said that in due course as part of a general review of debt recovery arrangements which would take longer than i can possibly say at the moment it might be felt appropriate to match the powers available in the debtors scotland act <e> <s> i can go no further than that <e>", "<cs> i take my noble friends point <e> <s> but experience shows that commitment to prison is the ultimate deterrent the deterrent that will bring about the results that we wish to see <e>", "<cs> except in scotland for the simple reason that the provision does not exist up there as i described just now <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross wishes to intervene <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross quotes from his former constituency <e> <s> the situation in scotland exists now for rates <e> <s> there is a difference between the two <e> <s> there are many other examples of differences in the way that this matter operates in scotland <e> <s> if we are to take the bill forward in the way proposed there will be one or two differences <e> <s> the reason for the difference in this case was set out clearly by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> he described how historically some things had not been tackled in scotland <e> <s> they did not require a great deal of work by the scottish law commission whereas other aspects of debt recovery did <e> <s> they are incorporated in the act which followed the act as i understand it <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady faithfull understood the force of the argument that an ultimate deterrent was necessary <e> <s> she may have shaken her head but she will read what she said in <e>", "<cs> i accept that but the suggestions that my noble friend makes are not ultimate enough if i may put it that way <e> <s> that is why we need this clement of the bill <e> <s> i appreciate that it is distasteful to many members of the committee nevertheless it is a necessity <e>", "<cs> i recognise what the noble lord is trying to achieve by these amendments but i hope i can reassure him that they are unnecessary <e> <s> the

persons as the court thinks fit <e> <s> when it came to considering the enforcement provisions for the community charge which are based largely on those in the general rate act we were advised by the home office that it was unnecessary to mention police constables specifically <e>", "<cs> unless i have my papers in a muddle the amendment was included in the grouping with amendments nos <e> <s> b c

to finance their expenditure <e> <s> before turning to the detail of the amendments it may assist the committee if i say a few words about the collection fund which is very much central to these

area a precept from the receiver for the metropolitan police district the other parts of their area being policed by the appropriate county council <e> <s> in such circumstances the metropolitan police precept which the district receives will fall on that part of the councils area which is policed by the metropolitan police <e> <s> the council will also receive revenue support grant and contributions from the national non-domestic rates pool <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord monson pointed out that his amendment was discrete in its own way and perhaps i can respond first to it <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the arguments put forward by both the noble lords lord ross of newport and lord monson <e> <s> perhaps i may deal first with amendment no <e> <s> a moved by the noble lord lord ross of newport <e> <s> that would have the effect of removing the power of the secretary of state to set a maximum multiplier in certain circumstances <e> <s> i cannot accept that he should be denied that right <e> <s> it is a power which is both useful and desirable <e> <s> for example we have made it clear that the power will be used to set a multiplier of zero for property which is empty

whatever multiplier it wishes <e> <s> it could set zero if it wanted or something more than zero <e>", "<cs> i can understand the noble lords point of view up to a point but that property will still exist <e> <s> let us suppose that it were to catch fire in the middle of the night <e> <s> that fire would still have to be extinguished by the local fire brigade <e> <s> that would be making use of local authority services <e> <s> it is a valid point <e> <s> it may not be an especially great one <e> <s> it goes to show that under certain circumstances there may be a need for the local authority to set a multiplier which is higher than zero <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may assure the noble lord lord ross of newport that we have given this proposal very careful consideration <e> <s> it is only following that consideration that we have concluded that the amendment cannot be justified <e> <s> the first point i would ask members of the committee to consider is that a standard community charge equal to two units of personal charge will be broadly equivalent to the average rate bill at present <e> <s> people who go abroad continue to pay rates on the home they leave behind as it is not at all unfair that they should pay the standard charge nor will they on average he any worse off with the standard charge than with the rates <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord looks at clause he will see that a specified class is <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord please repeat that <e>", "<cs> yes that is right <e> <s> there are a number of diplomats who have properties in the country and have to have a flat in london as well certainly perhaps the more senior ones so that would apply <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right when he says that the figures that i gave refer to a particular

to be taken into account <e> <s> indeed the figures which i quoted just now could be misleading <e> <s> there is official development assistance and there is the net aid programme there are calendar years and financial years there are different un targets for different categories of assistance <e> <s> together with factors outside our control including statistical freaks which was the case in all

already provided a commentary on the anglo-spanish declaration on gibraltar airport which deals with the matter fully <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that this was one of several matters discussed

say that i have not yet completed deploying my arguments and i shall endeavour to do so in due course <e> <s> what the noble lord says bears on the present spending levels and the course of them but i do not think it is necessarily profitable to run over old ground again <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i gave one single figure <e> <s> figures have been bandied about throughout the passage of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton produced figures which i do not dispute about the full community charge values in for camden and lewisham <e> <s> i believe that he quoted one other

without dual running in <e> <s> if i had more data on those figures i would certainly look at them but i do not believe that my figures are in any way incorrect <e>", "<cs> i will look at those figures but i do not really think it changes the purpose of clause <e> <s> the whole object of the exercise is to provide the protection which as i understand it my noble friend wants them to have <e> <s> the figures that we have been using in other discussions on this bill did not seem to be wildly out of line <e> <s> the fact is that this is if you like a means of safety for those who are paying for the charge payers and it is their interests which these provisions seek to protect <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that concern and i think that this material has been widely seen <e> <s> these are complex figures that appear on various charts <e> <s> i too have one in front of me which goes into the details of which local authorities have budgeted to spend or more at the area level above greas in and <e> <s> there are whole lists of figures and the figure of which the noble baroness quoted for greenwich is the safety-netted community charge without dual running in <e> <s> i do not think that that at all removes the importance of what i have said as regards protecting the community charge payer in these expensive local authority areas <e>", "<cs> i can give my assurance to the noble lord that the local authorities have been consulted in the role which the noble lord described and they are happy <e> <s> the noble lord might wonder why it is just wales that is affected <e> <s> the local government act recognised the special factors in wales which make it desirable for some district councils to be library authorities <e> <s> these factors consist of such things as sharp transitions in population distribution industrial concentration and language usage <e> <s> district councils are able to apply to the secretary of state at -year intervals to be constituted library authorities for their area in place of the county council <e> <s> i am advised that there is no parallel in england <e>", "<cs> what we are talking about here is the local government act which provided those particular factors the population factor the industrial concentration factor and the language factor <e> <s> i shall come back later if i may to the details <e>", "<cs> there are many bodies which at present obtain some or all of their revenues by making demands under a variety of statutory provisions on certain local authorities <e> <s> many of these provisions are framed in terms of the rating system and hence can no longer apply in the new system of local government finance <e> <s> the bill the provisions of clause would repeal all these provisions and in their place set up under clause a wide regulation-making power which would enable us to replicate existing arrangements for these bodies to obtain their revenue but in a form consistent with the new local government finance system <e>", "<cs> my lords no that is not the case <e> <s> it is not true that the united kingdom is isolated among the twelve on the possible response if the six were executed <e> <s> our

prevent this kind of thing happening again <e>", "<cs> my lords it is up to the noble lord to place whatever interpretation he finds it necessary to place <e> <s> i confess that i did not find it necessary to place that interpretation on any of the remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords romanias human rights record is about the worst in eastern europe <e> <s> we always raise that subject during

the noble lord should not confuse two items <e> <s> the question relates to disaster relief <e> <s> we respond quickly and generously as the noble lord lord molloy was kind enough to say to appeals for assistance in tackling natural disasters <e> <s> so far this year our emergency food aid disaster and refugee relief totalled almost million including about million for emergency disaster relief

best use of the money to meet the case in point <e>", "<cs> my lords in some cases i suspect that it will be new money but in the end there is the total aid budget to be looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords

matter for the visitor to decide and not for me <e> <s> however it is vital that we should not lose sight of the importance of developing a political dialogue and other relationships with iraq and putting them on a sounder footing <e> <s> iraq is a major regional power <e> <s> it has strong political and economic prospects <e> <s> however the noble lord is quite right in saying that allegations of chemical warfare being used must cast a cloud over our relationships <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend is quite right theirs is a history of tragedy <e> <s> that is why we want to try to do what we can to ensure that they have a more fulfilling future <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that is slightly wide of the immediate question <e> <s> the iran-iraq talks have started up again in geneva today <e> <s> whether or not those ultimately lead to some improvement in the condition of the kurds is an interesting possibility but i am not sure that the problems are directly related <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord that we shall lose no time at all in making the kinds of representations that he feels are necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not know precisely to whom it would be proper to address such representations but i shall certainly make inquiries and let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult to know what could be more on the agenda of the united nations <e> <s> as i have said the united nations produced resolution but the iraqis in this case refused to accept a mission <e> <s> it is on the agenda and will remain so <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that recent developments are more encouraging in respect of recognition by the soviet authorities of the need to give all the soviet people the right to choose their own future <e> <s> it is important that we bear these encouraging trends in mind <e> <s> i repeat what i said in my earlier answer namely that it is important for the people of those countries to have the chance to express their own views freely and democratically and to discuss the various possibilities and options <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the noble lord that it is a very delicate time <e> <s> certainly caution is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords the question relates specifically to the countries of estonia lithuania and latvia not to general matters of trade with the soviet union <e> <s> however i shall certainly see whether more facts about general trade with the soviet union relevant to the question are available <e> <s> i shall let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am trying this afternoon to answer a particular question relating to the baltic states <e> <s> i do not think it is necessarily right for the noble lord to infer that anything i have said about this matter relates to any other part of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is i believe absolutely right <e> <s> the fact is that in the eyes of some there are still serious problems about the way these countries are run and the history behind that <e> <s> as the noble lord suggests i am sure that it is quite right for us to say as little as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my earlier answer we raise that matter whenever necessary <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that our views will be made clear as appropriate whenever the occasion demands it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another interesting point <e> <s> i suspect that when it comes to various other aspects the noble and learned lord may well have put his finger on a very important point <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friends first supplementary question there are no plans to issue mr arafat with an invitation to visit this country <e> <s> on his second point as to why the united kingdom abstained on the more recent resolution we agreed with the substance of the resolution but its language was too strong <e> <s> we agree that the united states should respect the united nations but the united nations should likewise respect the united states <e> <s> as my noble friend suggested we and our european partners suggested amendments which would have allowed us to support the resolution without affecting its substance <e> <s> unfortunately they were not accepted <e> <s> to pick up my noble friends last point on the earlier motion the resolution of rd november to which he referred was unbalanced and our efforts to rectify the draft resolutions deficiencies did not succeed and so we abstained <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is aware that in many respects we regard the pnc decisions as positive steps <e> <s> we welcomed acceptance of resolutions and as a basis for an international conference <e> <s> another aspect of the matter is that the explicit rejection of terrorism is also important and i hope that that will be reflected in the plos actions <e> <s> the noble lord is going too far when he suggests that we are sycophantic with regard to the united states <e> <s> that is absolute rubbish with respect <e> <s> the pnc decisions included important steps forward <e> <s> moderate palestinians deserve encouragement as he will agree <e> <s> a shift in perception is needed not least in washington but our abstention must be seen in that context <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i have not yet seen that letter but i shall study it <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to a further debate outside new york it is important to find an opportunity to clarify the remaining ambiguities in the plo policy <e> <s> we believe that arafat should be heard <e> <s> if the general assembly meets in geneva as has been suggested we shall of course be there but our vote on any resolution will depend upon its text <e> <s> in respect of my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary meeting mr bush i am certain that should the opportunity present itself he and mr bush will take the chance to discuss the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords no i think that the noble lord is confusing two different points <e> <s> the first matter is that of the visa to the united states <e> <s> it is our view that mr arafat should have been allowed to address the general assembly <e> <s> we should have liked to have heard him confirm that the plo supports the idea of an international conference on the basis of security council resolutions and and rejects terrorism <e> <s> the draft resolution which we did not feel was right because of the language in which it was written is a separate matter which i have explained <e>", "<cs> my lords the important point is to try to achieve an end to this very long lasting and bloody conflict <e> <s> i do not think that it is possible to pick on any one aspect and say that it is right or wrong <e> <s> each side will have its own views on the details of the principles <e> <s> all i can say to the noble lord is that the <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i did <e> <s> as i said we feel that arafat should have been allowed to address the general assembly and we should like to have had confirmation of the points which i listed earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i very much agree with my noble friend <e> <s> there is always the risk particularly on this issue about which a great many people feel very strongly that such stridency might make it difficult to achieve the ends for which we all search <e> <s> that is why we believe that the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has picked on one word <e> <s> there were others in the draft and it is not right to try to redraft the communiqu at the dispatch box <e> <s> the fact is that we did not believe that the language was right we felt that it was too strong <e> <s> i do not honestly think that it is right in considering this matter for our abstention to be seen in any context other than that of the pnc decisions being important steps forward and we need to achieve a change of perception particularly in the attitude of the united states towards the whole performance <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble and learned friend i think that it is right that we should do precisely that <e> <s> the object of the exercise is to try to achieve the best and most satisfactory result <e> <s> that is what we are striving to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i think a great deal of work will be needed in order to make the necessary arrangements for the conference <e> <s> there is a consensus on the need for un auspices for the conference and the participation of the parties and the five permanent members <e> <s> but it is for the parties themselves to work out mutually acceptable arrangements <e> <s> i think it would be wrong to try to dictate terms from outside <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am aware of the claim made by mr botha <e> <s> there is no firm evidence that south africa has either conducted a nuclear test or that it possesses nuclear weapons <e> <s> we welcomed president bothas statement in september that south africa was willing to begin negotiations on the possibility of acceding to the non-proliferation treaty <e> <s> we have urged south africa to accede to that treaty and place its nuclear facilities under the full scope of the iaea safeguards <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope that south africa will sign and accede to the non-proliferation treaty <e> <s> however it is not the only country that does not accede <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that south africa has indicated that it may be willing to begin negotiations to that end <e> <s> i cannot forecast whether or not the negotiations will be successful but we hope that south africa will sign <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that one or two countries were one or two too many <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the noble lord says there is no firm evidence about south africas possession of a nuclear weapon despite the noble lords belief that he has such evidence <e> <s> as regards the iaea we firmly believe in and support south africas membership of that agency <e> <s> we do not imply by that our approval of the south african regime nor do we believe that it gives rise to the kind of concerns which the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord used the words extremely probable <e> <s> that does not amount to firm evidence <e> <s> i have said that there is no firm evidence that south africa has nuclear weapons <e> <s> as regards the application of iaea safeguards in south africa the koeberg nuclear power station is covered by the safeguards as is pelindaba nuclear research reactor and any safeguarded fuel submitted for reprocessing <e> <s> no agreement has yet been concluded with the agency on the application of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he points to the difficulty of obtaining this evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords apparently there is an almost endless number of supplementaries <e>", "<cs> my lords that presupposes of course that those who ask the questions agree with the answer that has been given <e> <s> in this case apparently they do not <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount lord buckmaster would have found it impossible i believe to find a more opportune moment to initiate this debate <e> <s> many of your lordships have referred to the th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights which we celebrated on th december <e> <s> i too should like to pay tribute to this declaration particularly in the context of this debate since for the past four decades the declaration has been of fundamental importance to the international communitys efforts to promote respect for human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may come back to that point in a moment when i deal specifically with the kurds and the alleged iraqi use of chemical weapons <e> <s> i shall endeavour to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl may not agree but the fact is that a balance must be struck in such matters that is what we try to achieve <e> <s> i do not believe for one minute that the noble earl can claim that in our attempts to meet the horrifying effects of terrorism of which the noble earl is fully <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may look at my last letter to the noble lord and reply to him in the light of his remarks and what i have just said about my understanding that we can raise the situation again next time <e> <s> of course i shall place a copy of the letter in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords if i mistook the noble lord i apologise <e> <s> perhaps i may give him the same answer to that point <e> <s> my honourable friend had a meeting only on th december <e> <s> this is a step in that direction <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will welcome that <e> <s> we shall certainly consider any other suggestions for meetings in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been the policy of this government to deplore terrorist acts of whatever kind wherever they occur and we shall continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the important point to bear in mind is that there has been a change in the stance of the plo <e> <s> we welcome mr arafats renunciation of terrorism and we trust that the plo will live up to his commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any special congress <e> <s> i think that it is important that we should continue to strive to help in the search for a peace solution <e> <s> that is what we have been looking for for some time <e> <s> it was in that light that we welcomed mr arafats new commitment to such a solution which was recently reiterated at a meeting with my honourable friend the minister of state <e> <s> that is why we believe that an international conference remains the most suitable framework for the necessary negotiations between the parties directly concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is important to keep up the momentum of our bilateral relations <e> <s> that will be achieved when mr shamir comes here and may be achieved before then if visits take place in the other direction <e> <s> so far as concerns the united states yes it is important that its engagement is wholehearted and we welcome the united states plo dialogue <e> <s> we look forward to early contacts with the new us administration on those matters <e>", "<cs> my lords we continue to play our full part in bringing both sides in the dispute to understand the merits of the suggested conference <e> <s> we shall continue to do all that we can to bring that about <e>", "<cs> my lords it is all very well to look to the past and it is important that we do so from time to time <e> <s> however it is also important that we direct our energies toward a policy that will provide a satisfactory future and that is what we propose to do <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall put over whatever points are necessary in order to try to bring about the kind of resolution that we seek <e> <s> we have to speak frankly with all those concerned and shall continue to do so <e> <s> i am sure that the point made by the noble lord will not in any way be lost <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the noble lords question pointed up the importance of the international conference in respect of this issue <e> <s> i do not think it is possible to find a solution in a matter of minutes across the floor of the house <e> <s> it is a complicated matter and that is why we need to have the international conference to which reference has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i shall comment on the noble viscounts last point <e> <s> i can say <e>", "<cs> my lords we have long been active in helping developing countries to promote their private sectors <e> <s> advice on privatisation is one element of that <e> <s> it is widely acknowledged that both the government and the british private sector have a special expertise here and we stand ready to consider further requests for assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords all that we have done is to ask our posts in developing countries to keep their eyes open together with the americans who share our interest for cases in which advice on the development of the private sector including privatisation might be welcomed <e> <s> we certainly have no intention of imposing our views <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly the adam smith institute report to which i think the noble baroness is referring is being looked at carefully <e> <s> however we see no reason at this stage to establish a privatisation unit of the kind to which she refers <e> <s> our present bilateral aid systems are well able to cope <e>", "<cs> i should think my lords that it was very hypothetical <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that not every body takes that view <e> <s> indeed a number of countries have benefited from the advice given by the united kingdom <e> <s> i could certainly let the noble lord have details <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e> <s> privatisation is only one aspect of that matter <e> <s> there are a number of very good instances which i could give him to show how poor countries have been helped in developing their private sectors by both aspects <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not helping to break up anything <e> <s> these countries are coming to us for advice <e> <s> we can assist them in three broad ways <e> <s> the first is by encouraging an appropriate environment in which the private sector may flourish often in the context of structural adjustment <e> <s> secondly there is the identification of public sector activities which could be transferred to the private sector and privatisation is only one of the mechanisms involved <e> <s> thirdly there are the mechanics of privatisation <e> <s> these are all helpful <e> <s> they are matters on which other countries have asked us to advise in many cases <e> <s> that is all that we are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is getting himself into the most terrible muddle <e> <s> there is nothing cloak and dagger about this <e> <s> other countries have come to us <e> <s> we have asked our posts to keep their eyes open because they may find that they can be helpful and through that that we can assist those countries to achieve a sensible future for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead for giving me this opportunity to dispel some of the current popular myths about the governments conduct of this countrys foreign relations <e> <s> indeed his speech itself reflected some of those myths <e> <s> i shall therefore try to explain why i believe the noble lords views are in some cases misplaced and why his apprehensions are unfounded <e> <s> as with the leave of the house i shall have the chance to reply to this debate i propose now to concentrate on the fundamental principles underlying the conduct of our foreign relations <e> <s> i will deal with other aspects in detail when i wind up <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a good debate with many notable contributions to which i have listened carefully <e> <s> to the noble lord lord bonham-carter i say that i agree and that i have indeed been set something of a challenge <e> <s> with a certain amount of material before me i shall try not to detain him too long <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord likes to look at the figures he will find that compared with the original overseas aid budget this year of billion the figure for the coming years represents an increase over the period in cash terms of per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> after allowing for expected inflation <e> <s> the important thing is to look to the future not always to the past which appears to be a feature of the noble lords comments <e>", "<cs> my lords the united states engagement is important and the dialogue between the united states and the plo is welcome <e> <s> we look forward to early contacts with the new united states administration <e> <s> it has assured us that it attaches priority to early movement and progress towards peace <e> <s> the noble lord might also like to know that british efforts to advance the peace process are complementary to those of the twelve <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question for either the soviet union or the united states to answer <e> <s> however i can tell the noble lord that i understand that the state department has denied it <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend is going to israel in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> we find the plo moves encouraging <e> <s> the search for peace deserves the active support of all israelis as well <e> <s> i hope they <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i understand that point of view but on the other hand i believe that israels security can only be achieved through peace with all its neighbours <e> <s> the repression of the palestinians breeds resentment and hatred and does not encourage security <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it will be possible to think again because we are committed to the joint declaration and to working for the continued stability and prosperity of hong kong <e> <s> i should have thought that what the noble lord proposes would work the opposite way to that which he intends <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> that possibility has been apparent for many years as the noble lord is aware and the present british nationality law reflects views expressed by parliament during the passage of the british nationality act and indeed in earlier nationality and immigration acts <e> <s> we are seeking to create conditions in which people will want to stay in hong kong <e> <s> they are of course free to leave and they are also at liberty to return as indeed many do <e> <s> concerning contacts with other governments i can certainly say that there has been no recent contact with the portuguese government on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said it is important to build where we can on the conditions which will make hong kong an attractive place in which people can live work and plan their lives <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble lords argument is flawed because it is difficult to see how the chinese would welcome a move which could be used as a sanction against violation by them of the joint declaration <e> <s> the noble lords argument is muddled <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend is confusing the general issue that was discussed during the passage of the british nationality act with the matter of others who might for one reason or another want to come here <e> <s> there are cases where those who wish to come to invest in this country can come under the rules that my noble friend knows <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows section of the british nationality act is a matter for the home secretarys discretion <e> <s> it was made perfectly plain during the passage of that act that the use to be made of that section would be very sparing <e>", "<cs> my lords including this financial year the annual funding of the bbc world service has increased by some per cent <e> <s> in real terms since <e>", "<cs> my lords the government considered very carefully the bbc request for public funds in order to start up a world television news service <e> <s> we noted that a commercial world television news service started without public funds and we concluded that the provision of public funds to the bbc for this purpose was not justified <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no plans to reduce them <e> <s> the output in terms of hours has increased from to a week <e>", "<cs> my lords that will be looked at when we come to consider the next triennia <e> <s> these matters are fixed three years at a time so that will be decided in the public expenditure round <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot confirm that the figure of per cent <e> <s> which my noble friend quotes is correct <e> <s> it is worth putting this matter in context <e> <s> the total of million for current expenditure in amounts to roughly what it costs to run all british embassies and consulates in eastern and western europe and the middle east <e> <s> it is also per cent <e> <s> more than the foreign and commonwealth office spends worldwide on export promotion <e> <s> it is also over per cent <e> <s> more than the british council diplomatic wing fundings <e> <s> so in total it is a very significant amount <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is understandable that the service should be worried that its recurrent expenditure might be diminished to some extent because of the importance of carrying out the capital works that work is the most important part of the operation <e> <s> if the programmes cannot be heard it is not going to do anyone any good at all <e> <s> as regards the three transmitters the grant-in-aid was topped up to take account of the cost of running those three transmitters <e>", "<cs> my lords all these matters are carefully considered <e> <s> there have to be priorities <e> <s> the current priorities are to improve audibility in the subcontinent and in southern africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly confirm to my noble friend that the standard of broadcasts from bush house is universally respected wherever one goes in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give comparative figures with the voice of america in output per hours <e> <s> the bbc is estimated to have million regular listeners abroad excluding china which is the largest of any external broadcaster <e> <s> the figure is roughly divided into million listeners in english and million in vernacular languages <e>", "<cs> my lords the queen is present at commonwealth heads of government meetings as head of the commonwealth at the invitation of the host government <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that this might normally be from the prime minister concerned through the governor general direct <e>", "<cs> my lords the question that was asked related to commonwealth heads of government meetings as i understood that the queen attends <e> <s> in the next case the meeting will be in malaysia in october <e> <s> questions concerning south africa go rather wider than the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure of the basis for the noble lords figure of a per cent <e> <s> decline <e> <s> i suspect that it might have been from a quotation of figures that i saw in the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is extremely important as my noble friend suggests to ensure that the aid we provide is adequately and properly spent at the point of receipt <e> <s> that is not always easy to achieve but i can assure him that in every case we do our best to achieve it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very important point and one that is taken into account as we plan aid for the years ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords great note is taken of those points and indeed of the expertise which her royal highness the princess royal shows in this field <e> <s> the important factor is to try to ensure that the very high quality of aid which is available and which we provide is adequately looked after when it reaches the point of receipt <e> <s> my noble friend will be aware that it is not always possible to achieve the aim in the way we should like but we always strive to do precisely that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give the noble baroness the precise figure without notice <e> <s> however i shall certainly consider the matter and let her know <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> it is misleading to try to compare outturn with planning figures which is what he suggests that i do <e> <s> it is not a valid comparison <e> <s> indeed the aid programme has increased by million this year and it could be accurately compared in the way that the noble lord suggests only if we had not added that extra million <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly encouragement to other countries is an important factor <e> <s> however the tragedies are primarily a matter for humanitarian aid <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the government have an extremely good record on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble baroness chapter and verse on sub-saharan africa <e> <s> on debt burdens my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer introduced a debt initiative <e> <s> it was a three point plan first the conversion of aid loans to grants secondly the extension of repayment and grace periods and thirdly lower interest rates on official debt rescheduled through the paris club <e> <s> those are very positive developments and go a long way towards meeting the concern that the noble baroness expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i dispute the figure to which the noble lord has just referred <e> <s> i would go further and say that it is perhaps not too wise to become fixed upon the gnp target important though it may be which would be easier to meet if we were prepared to mismanage the economy and reduce gnp <e>", "<cs> my lords we agree with the secretary general that the proposed reductions to which the noble lord refers will not prejudice the smooth and efficient implementation of the plan <e> <s> the secretary general has retained as the ceiling for untags military component and has increased the number of police and military observers <e> <s> the terms of the united nations plan provided that actual numbers deployed should depend on the united nations secretary generals assessment of the current situation on the

we would consider promptly and sympathetically any request made by the secretary general <e> <s> the south africans have significantly reduced police levels in the territory and have disbanded the counter-insurgency police unit <e> <s> they have also undertaken to reduce the combined strength of the south african defence forces and the south-west african territorial forces to by st april <e>

resolution of th february which describes precisely how it should operate <e> <s> we should support them both <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that fact put in quite the way the noble lord has addressed it <e> <s> but i shall certainly examine the position <e>", "<cs> my lords the element that we are going to provide is a signals unit <e> <s> initially it will consist of a group of about later i believe that group will consist of members <e> <s> they will fly out on friday <e>", "<cs> my lords the recommendations of the united nations secretary general were based on the observations of a united nations reconnaissance team which visited namibia and were also made in the light of the positive developments in the region which have taken place since notably the agreements of nd december reached between angola cuba and south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make provision with respect to the reference of appeals from the supreme court of brunei

authorities <e> <s> they have denied any deportations to the south of the country but have admitted to some localised resettling on security grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made clear to the iraqis that despite the proximity of these towns to the iran-iraq border there is no justification for the mass deportations which are alleged to have occurred <e> <s> my honourable friend mr waldegrave the minister of state at the foreign office saw the iraqi ambassador only yesterday <e> <s> he raised this matter with him and it was a point that was taken on board <e> <s> we use every

ambassador about that <e> <s> while i referred to the south of the country we have to respect iraqs legitimate security concerns in the north <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords who have taken part in the debate for giving the bill such a good welcome <e> <s> it has been a useful <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely take the noble lords point <e> <s> i visited christchurch about a year or so ago i was given a thorough briefing there by the new zealand authorities on the concerns they had about such matters <e> <s> there are a whole range of different aspects which could have an impact <e> <s> i think that the noble lord is on to a very good point <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i agree entirely with the noble lord that the violence is terrible and that we want to see it brought to an end <e> <s> that is why we believe that it is important to encourage all those concerned to bring about an international conference by any method that they can and why the role of the european community and the united states is important <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord might best address that question to the israelis <e> <s> the fact is that the search for peace deserves the active support of all israelis <e> <s> i hope they will accept that an international conference presents an opportunity and is not a trap <e> <s> the israelis cannot deny to the palestinians rights that they themselves earned at such great cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree as regards the noble lords statement that a stalemate has been reached <e> <s> we are certainly ready for discussions within the five if the others agree <e> <s> the noble lord was quite right to point to the importance of the united states lead in this and the recent statement made by president bush following the visit of mr mubarak to washington <e>", "<cs> my lords we deplore violence wherever it takes place as i have said <e> <s> the fact that through the remarks made by president bush recently the united states is encourging discussions is all to the good <e> <s> as i have said we are ready for discussions in the five which seems a sensible place to take the matter forward if the others will agree to discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords as i told the noble lord on rd march the reason we do not propose to grant right of abode to million hong kong british dependent territory citizens is that we do not believe that there would be sufficient support in this country for wholesale changes to the law which would entail the prospect albeit a theoretical one of large-scale immigration from hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords the remarks which were alleged to have been made by the chinese foreign minister to the hong kong press on nd march are i think those to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> they made clear as he has done that the question of granting right of abode in this country to hong kong british passport holders is a matter for her majestys government <e> <s> nevertheless i hope that the noble lord will not fail to take into account that the matter of nationality is very sensitive for the chinese government <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> as i said in answer to the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford just now the matter of nationality is one of great sensitivity with the chinese government <e> <s> indeed their position is set out in a chinese memorandum on passport and nationality matters associated with the joint declaration which states that under chinese nationality law <e>", "<cs> my lords no one is disputing the loyalty of the hong kong chinese <e> <s> what i would dispute though is the histories of all those countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that although the matter of tibet might cause concern it is a red herring <e> <s> the histories of hong kong and tibet are totally different <e> <s> as regards looking at the matter again i have explained that i believe there would not be sufficient support for the kind of move which is proposed <e> <s> nevertheless we shall no doubt study the report of the foreign affairs committee of another place when it emerges in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can comment on the suggestion about a bill of rights in hong kong <e> <s> at the moment as the noble baroness will be aware the basic law drafting committee has submitted its second revise which is being examined through a consultative process <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand both those points <e> <s> the noble lord has made them with great clarity many times <e> <s> however i must tell him <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall have to see first what the recommendation is <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it they would not be portuguese under the circumstances which the noble viscount mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the first supplementary question of the noble lord he will be well aware that the history of tibet and the history of hong kong cannot be directly concerned in this matter although of course we have made clear our views upon what has happened in tibet in recent months <e> <s> on the suggestions which the noble lord made concerning the british nationality act these are all subjects which no doubt will come to the fore again when the foreign affairs committee of another place reports <e> <s> i cannot anticipate that because i have not seen what the committee will say <e> <s> however i can tell the noble lord that even the suggestions he has just made are ones which might in all the circumstances be quite difficult to achieve because of the very reasons i gave earlier that they may not command sufficient support in the country both in parliament and elsewhere <e> <s> i believe that that encompasses the third point the noble lord made <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the point of view of the noble lord but i do not think he can make the comparisons he has and imagine that they are valid comparisons because the nationality laws relating to the two countries have long been different <e> <s> the nationality law of portugal differs from our own in that portuguese nationals in portuguese overseas territories have always had the right of abode in portugal <e> <s> that situation existed long before the signing of the sino-portuguese joint declaration on macao <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not forcing independence upon hong kong that is the whole point <e> <s> the fact is that hong kong is reverting to china under the terms of the lease which expires on th june <e> <s> i do not think it is possible to make the comparisons which the noble lord draws <e> <s> he is well aware of the history of this matter <e> <s> there have been several changes to our nationality laws since the most recent being in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in close touch both with our european partners and the other permanent members of the security council <e> <s> we fully support the efforts of the arab league to arrange a ceasefire and a negotiated solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that the government are fully seized of the horrors of the destruction which continues seemingly unabated <e> <s> we are in constant touch with the secretary general of the united nations <e> <s> indeed my right honourable friend the prime minister discussed lebanon with him on th april <e> <s> we share the view that we should use our contacts to achieve a ceasefire and we support the initiative of the arab league because we believe that is the best bet in current circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the organisations are there and they have a role to play as does the european community which has issued a number of statements <e> <s> but we have to make those statements whether the noble lord likes it or not <e> <s> we have also expressed our full backing to the arab league for its efforts to achieve a political settlement <e> <s> the member states stand ready to do what is thought helpful in any other way we can <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter was certainly discussed with the secretary general on th april <e> <s> however i am afraid i cannot say whether it was discussed with the soviets which is the point the noble lord made <e> <s> however i can assure him that where we can develop a role and see it taken forward we shall certainly play our part <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting proposition and we would support any realistic attempts to achieve a durable and negotiated settlement leading to the restoration of peace and the full sovereignty independence territorial integrity and national unity of lebanon <e>", "<cs> my lords not that i know of <e>", "<cs> my lords the short answer to the noble lords question about the number of ceasefires is that we have probably all lost count <e> <s> that does not mean that we should not continue to call for them because no sensible means of taking the matter forward can be achieved without a ceasefire <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly something we would consider <e> <s> however it is an internal dispute <e> <s> there are therefore difficulties with the united nations charter which says that initially regional groupings should be used to deal with this kind of problem <e> <s> that is why we believe that the arab league is tailor-made for the situation in the first instance rather than the united nations <e> <s> nevertheless i shall certainly note my noble friends remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords the stated objective of the warsaw pact is the elimination of nuclear weapons from europe <e> <s> natos long-standing strategy of flexible response requires maintenance of an effective mix of up-to-date conventional and nuclear forces including land-based missiles <e> <s> this conflict of objectives does not provide a fruitful basis for negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not agree less with the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> his comments appear to indicate that he does not understand even the most basic elements in the process of trying to take forward the cuts which he appears to seek which have already been taken forward in start and which we hope will shortly be taken forward in respect of the conventional force imbalance and on the chemical war front <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> if the suggested negotiations towards equal ceilings of short-range weapons took place matters could become much more serious <e> <s> negotiations would drag on and soviet pressure for a third zero would increase <e> <s> we cannot be sure that all alliance governments would have the resolve to resist in the face of a sustained public relations campaign which is what this amounts to <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord is not quite right in his suggestions <e> <s> of course the federal republic of germany position is important but the germans themselves acknowledge that decisions on nato strategy will be taken by the alliance as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords yes my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> the soviet union has introduced over sss into eastern europe since to replace the missiles <e> <s> furthermore soviet frog nuclear-capable artillery has improved continuously throughout the s as towed systems have been replaced by more modern self-propelled systems <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the lack of imagination is for those who do not imagine quite what the soviet union might seek to achieve from that sort of arrangement <e> <s> the fact is that one can have arms control negotiations that make sense only when the prospective parties share a common goal <e> <s> that might apply <e> <s> it applies in the ca se of start and in conventional and chemical warfare but certainly not to short-range missiles <e> <s> furthermore no one has suggested a plausible method of verifying equal ceilings on snf missile systems <e> <s> the warsaw pact would soon argue that only a third zero could be verified <e> <s> i must ask the noble lord whether he thinks that nato could walk away from the negotiating table then <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that nothing would be more calculated to remove confidence in what we are trying to do than breaking down what has essentially kept the peace in europe for the last years <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has put his finger on the most important aspect of the whole issue <e> <s> as the house will know there has already been a per cent <e> <s> reduction in natos stockpile of nuclear weapons in europe since whereas the recent soviet indication is that they would cut only out of short-range missile systems <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be a mistake for the noble lord to think for one minute that that view is held by my right honourable friend the prime minister alone <e> <s> as has already been said what is important is that nato is an alliance which has been effective for the past years and the decision that will ultimately be taken must be one for the alliance as a whole <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend that that is the case <e> <s> one of <e>", "<cs> no my lords i have not seen it <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that it is encouraging as far as it goes <e> <s> nevertheless we should not allow ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> the message is the same and i believe he would find similar comfort in the first lines of kiplings poem <e>", "<cs> my lords there is considerable support for the position on a number of different issues <e> <s> on modernisation there is much common ground <e> <s> we are all agreed on the principle of no third zero <e> <s> we all agree the need to keep weapons up to date where necessary <e> <s> in fact the communique from the nuclear planning group on th-th april affirmed support of the defence ministers for our efforts to meet requirements stemming from montebello to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent posture <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> that is the key to it all i suspect in many senses <e> <s> but i am sure that my noble friend will not have overlooked the fact that at the same time as the increases on the soviet conventional side there have been some staggering increases on the modernisation of the soviet short-range nuclear forces as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord will find he is wrong if he believes that we are isolated on this matter <e> <s> the fact is that if we go down the road which he advocates of negotation we shall find ourselves faced with the possibility of the third zero which nato is already agreed should not take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is right <e> <s> i am sure he is also aware that peace has now been maintained in europe which includes germany for over years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure how to respond to that piece of verse <e> <s> nevertheless i find it most interesting <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that when the noble lord reads tomorrow what he has just said he may disagree with it <e> <s> he talks about verification <e> <s> nobody has suggested a satisfactory method of verifying equal ceilings of small mobile nuclear weapons systems which on the warsaw pact side are capable of firing nuclear conventional and chemical warheads <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that if we were to proceed down the path that the noble lord advocates we should not be forgiven by anybody for allowing the peace which has existed for years plus to be eroded <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord accurately quotes from article of the treaty of lausanne <e> <s> the difficulty is that there is an earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the turkish government appreciate the importance of welsh speaking in this country particularly in wales <e> <s> nevertheless i do not believe that we can go down that particular road although i confirm that the figures given by the noble lord are broadly correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to say anything more about the ec application other than that it is now being considered by the commission <e> <s> i cannot predict what will happen or how long it will take <e> <s> however there are many other suitable avenues for ventilating the concerns which exist about human rights anywhere and they include the european convention on human rights to which turkey is a party <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of many of the concerns which have been raised about the abuses of human rights to which the noble viscount has referred <e> <s> however his question goes a little further than the treaty of lausanne <e>", "<cs> my lords i also have that article in front of me but i cannot interpret the treaty of lausanne from the dispatch box in quite the way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that i said that in quite the way which the noble lord suggests <e> <s> as regards the united nations he will be aware that the security councils views were expressed in the presidents statement of st march <e> <s> that statement expressed how gravely concerned it was about the present situation <e> <s> it called for an immediate ceasefire and supported the efforts being worked for towards a peaceful solution <e> <s> as i said on the last occasion we are constantly in touch with the secretary general <e>", "<cs> my lords we still consider that the arab leagues efforts offer the best chance of success in the present circumstances <e> <s> it should be allowed a free hand before the international community considers alternative approaches such as the one advocated by the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> i can certainly say that we deplore threats to the arab league observers reportedly issued by the druze leader mr jumblatt <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much take on board my noble friends worries <e> <s> i believe that there are two reasons why it would not be practicable for the united nations to sort it out in quite the way suggested by the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> first despite justified international concern and it is justified and the presence of foreign forces it remains an internal problem <e> <s> secondly the united nations charter says that regional grouping should be used first to deal with this kind of problem <e> <s> i should have thought that the arab league was the right answer for this particular issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his comments about the work of the ambassador and his staff <e> <s> they are doing an excellent job in what the whole house will appreciate are very difficult circumstances indeed <e> <s> however i regret that i am unable to tell the noble lord what took place at that meeting but i shall certainly find out and let him know <e> <s> on humanitarian aid our contribution to the lebanon amounts to nearly million a year and that is mostly through the united nations organisations and the international committee of the red cross <e> <s> i believe that represents the most effective way of getting aid to the lebanon and we will continue to pursue it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his support for the measures we are taking in our general encouragement to bring about a proper internal solution to the problem <e> <s> as regards lebanese living elsewhere that is an important point but their best interests also will be served by the solution which the noble lord hopes will eventually emerge <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> we have embarked now upon a new aspect of the bill that which deals with consumer committees in clause <e> <s> it might be therefore be helpful to the committee if before we deal with the substance of the amendment of my noble friend lord peyton i outline the issues rather more fully <e> <s> my noble friend hoped that brevity on his part would not indicate any lack of enthusiasm for his own amendment <e> <s> i fear that my brevity may not be quite equal to his if i have to explain the matter as fully as i think i should because so much of what has been said in this short debate has encompassed the wider issues relating to consumer committees which are important when we look at this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can give the noble lord the reassurance which he seeks <e> <s> it is certainly the case that consumers committees will have a right of access to the secretary of state and that the secretary of state ultimately has the responsibility which the noble lord and my noble friend ascribed to him <e> <s> there should be no difficulty whatever in the consumers committees getting to that point <e>", "<cs> that is an interesting hypothetical situation but nevertheless i suspect that with my noble friends experience it may be a real one <e> <s> if that sort of situation arises it is a matter in the first instance for the director to sort out <e> <s> ultimately as i have said in answer to the noble lord lord peston if access is required by these committees to the secretary of state that access is available <e> <s> that presumably shifts the burden from the director to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i shall always reflect upon my noble friends amendments and the advice which he puts forward <e> <s> i used the word incestuous in its colloquial sense when i spoke earlier but i think that that is not a real concern <e> <s> here we have a balance which is right <e> <s> it is one which i understand is comparable to those in other pieces of legislation currently before the chamber <e> <s> i am thinking of the water bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may follow the noble lord lord peston and respond primarily to his amendment no <e> <s> since he has not referred to the other amendments specifically <e> <s> i should like to begin by explaining that part i of the bill establishes the regulatory regime for the electricity supply industry after reorganisation <e> <s> the regulatory regime is designed to protect the interests of the consumer from possible abuses of monopoly power by the reorganised and eventually privatised industry <e> <s> within the overall regulatory framework the consumers committees have a vital role to play <e>", "<cs> i dare say they can make an input but the input surely will take place during the parliamentary scrutiny <e> <s> it is rather like the kind of scrutiny we are conducting now where consumer bodies make their representations known <e> <s> i suggest that that is the appropriate mechanism <e> <s> it is not one which should be directly part of the consumer elements which we are talking about <e> <s> at the moment we are dealing with those elements under part i of the bill as opposed to parts ii and iii <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i do not know the answer to that <e> <s> i suspect that it is possible for them to make some representations <e> <s> i know that anything to do with the monopolies and mergers commission is fairly complex and i hate to trespass on that ground <e> <s> i shall certainly try to find out in order to satisfy my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i shall try to help the noble lord a little further <e> <s> the first point to make is that the bill specifically states that the committees have a wider role in consumer affairs than just that of handling complaints <e> <s> they can of course advise on anything that the noble lord would wish them to advise on <e>", "<cs> the short answer to the noble lord is yes <e> <s> if he cares to look at clause a of the bill he will see that it refers to the general duties of the consumers committees to advise the director <e> <s> not only would they be able to give evidence to the monopolies and mergers commission and i daresay also take up any other matter with the director general of fair trading but no doubt they would also through making the representations that clause a allows them to do be able to advise the director who may himself be able to do precisely what the noble lord seeks <e>", "<cs> we covered this point before dinner in some detail <e> <s> if the noble lord reads what was said then i think he will be reassured to learn that the committees concerned can always approach the secretary of state direct <e> <s> i think that that takes into account the case that he envisages <e> <s> however i urge him to study the point which was considered in considerable detail before dinner <e>", "<cs> i do not think that it is possible to draw conclusions from one experience in a different field of which i accept the noble lord has considerable knowledge <e> <s> the secretary of state has a most important role to play <e> <s> that is why it is important that if the committees are not satisfied for some reason with the work of the director and his role is set out in schedule i they have the right to go to the secretary of state <e> <s> i am quite sure that the secretary of state would not be satisfied if it was possible to uphold the kind of point which the noble lord has raised <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that we shall ever reach agreement on this point <e> <s> i was slightly surprised to see that there was an earlier amendment which was not moved which would have exempted the director from scrutiny by the ombudsman <e> <s> in the circumstances it is a good thing that it was not moved <e>", "<cs> when the property rights and liabilities of the area boards are vested in their successor companies they will be vested in their entirety <e> <s> the successor companies will on receipt of their licences become the public electricity suppliers for the existing areas of the area boards as they are presently constituted <e> <s> the government are fully committed to the appointment of one consumers committee in the area of each of the successor companies to the area boards and the two successor companies in scotland <e>", "<cs> i certainly understand the interest of the noble lord lord peston in wishing to ensure the protection of the interests of domestic consumers and indeed the interest of my noble friend in securing precisely the same object <e> <s> it is a concern which i think we all share <e> <s> but i think i can explain why it would be unnecessary to amend the clause in the way proposed by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i cannot say whether any individual consumer body has done so <e> <s> i can say that the area electricity consultative councils have taken that view <e> <s> i do not think one can lump them together and call them one body but they certainly have welcomed the proposals <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i can necessarily take the noble lords word for that but i shall certainly check on it <e> <s> i said to my noble friend that i did not have that particular information <e> <s> i said that the area electricity consultative councils apparently welcomed those proposals <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that there had been many that had represented consumers councils <e> <s> i should have thought that many of those who spoke in another place in support of the bill when it went through committee there could be counted upon as supporting those councils in their approach to the bill <e> <s> indeed i can quote at length some remarks in support of the consumer protection proposals in the bill from a range of different <e>", "<cs> those that i have listed here are councils <e> <s> whether or not there are any other individual bodies i do not know nor do i know whether one counts the electricity supply trade union council as one <e> <s> however we may perhaps be tilting at windmills in this case because the majority of people welcome these proposals <e> <s> those are the people who are represented by the electricity consultative councils of the areas and the electricity consumers council <e> <s> perhaps i may continue <e>", "<cs> i know that my noble friend has an important role in the consumer movement <e> <s> we are all aware of that <e> <s> perhaps she does not go so far in her council as both the electricity consumers council and these other individual ones <e> <s> i do not know of any other individual outlet that has made these particular claims <e> <s> however perhaps we can move on to the other parts with which this amendment deals <e>", "<cs> the consumers committees will be able to review and report on any matter in their area relating to the supply of electricity as well as carrying out a number of functions relating to the protection of electricity consumers interests <e> <s> therefore it is only right that when appointing members to a committee the director should have regard to the desirability of appointing a person who has experience of the matters and indeed has shown capacity in as the noble lord lord macaulay mentioned and i shall come back to that element in a moment matters relevant to the provision of electricity supply services <e> <s> this does not mean that they need to have worked in the industry but it points towards the desirability of candidates with relevant experience for example in consumer issues <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has hardly given me a moment even to get to my feet <e> <s> if he allows me to proceed i will endeavour to explain why i cannot agree with him in his argument <e> <s> i was about to say that i very much agree with my noble friend lord peyton that what we need on these committees are people who are capable <e> <s> they should be lay people who have the sort of background which will enable them to discharge their duties effectively in much the way that my noble friend described it people with bags of common sense and wide experience <e> <s> there are many ideas which could be encompassed in the suggestions made by the noble lord but those are the sort of people who should usefully be employed on these committees <e> <s> in a sense this argument is similar to that which we had on clause about the people who ought to come forward to be considered for director <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has perhaps missed the point in subsection which states <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to invite my noble friend to put down any amendment <e> <s> this clause goes some way to supplying the kind of considerations that a director has to have regard to when it comes to appointing the committees <e> <s> i do not believe that the method that the noble lord lord ezra has chosen would leave the matter open enough <e> <s> i believe that it would go the opposite way and restrict it <e>", "<cs> this has been an interesting discussion <e> <s> although i should like to study what has been said by the noble lords lord tordoff and lord ezra and others what my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil said may perhaps be a much more straightforward method than that suggested by the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> i should like to study what has been said <e> <s> i am certainly not prepared to commit myself at this stage but i hope that the noble lord will allow me to consider it <e>", "<cs> i certainly appreciate my noble friends concern that consumers commmittees should be able to appeal to the secretary of state if they find themselves to be in an irreconcilable dispute with the director <e> <s> of course we hope that the director and the consumers committees will be able to work out any differences between themselves <e> <s> one of the advantages of the new approach to consumer representation under the bill is that such committees will not be stuck out on their own isolated from the rest of the regulatory organisation but will be fully integrated with the directors offices and reporting directly to him <e> <s> that will mean that the committees and the directors offices will be working together with the same aims and objectives <e> <s> this co-ordinated and integrated approach should mean that the potential for disputes will be greatly reduced if not removed altogether <e>", "<cs> i am always happy to take on board the concerns of the noble baroness about letters <e> <s> however in this instance i am not sure whether the letter has anything to do with the bill <e> <s> but if it has i shall certainly look into the matter <e> <s> the fact is that people do have the right as my noble friend lord renton pointed out to make representations and they do so <e> <s> i very much agree with him that if one were to put anything on the face of the bill about that point it would only be wise under the circumstances which i do not think <e>", "<cs> the difficulty i find with the suggestion of my noble friend is that he is seeking to write on the face of the bill a provision which is the right of us all in any case and which would not in effect add to what is already provided for by the right that we have discussed <e> <s> my noble friend seeks to write on to the face of the statute something which is already the right of us all <e> <s> my noble friend says that a consumer body has made a representation to him <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend had allowed me to continue i would have reached that point <e> <s> my noble friend is suggesting that we write something into the bill which is already there as of right for all individuals <e> <s> he claims that there are those who suggest that this would be the most practicable way of taking forward the kind of concerns which have been registered with him <e> <s> my concern is that such a provision would be contrary to the kind of practice we normally follow in legislation and possibly even to the practices in some of the pieces of legislation which my noble friend dealt with in his time as a minister <e> <s> that is a real risk <e> <s> nevertheless i am perfectly prepared to accept what my noble friend says as regards this matter being one of concern generally throughout the chamber <e> <s> i am of course prepared to look at it again <e> <s> i do so without commitment because i wish to study what has been said <e> <s> however i shall gladly study the matter <e>", "<cs> it may save the time of the committee if i respond at this stage <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend lady oppenheim-barnes will realise that we gave considerable thought to the question of <e>", "<cs> i raised the matter of wedges <e> <s> when i referred to the eccs annual report and my noble friends responsibilities as chairman of the national consumer council i said i did not seek to drive wedges between two different bodies which were essentially trying to deal with the same matter <e> <s> indeed in her amendment my noble friend seeks to bring forward yet another commission so to some extent the argument that she has just used could be turned on the body which she proposes to create <e>", "<cs> it has always been part of the governments plans that there should be some public meetings of the consumer committees <e> <s> certainly that has not been precluded in any sense by the current drafting of the bill <e> <s> nevertheless we must be quite clear that the new committees thanks to the new rights and duties which they will have been given will have on occasion access to commercially confidential information and indeed to the personal details of individual complainants <e> <s> the latter may well include details of customers who are experiencing hardship and it would clearly be improper to allow an automatic right of access to the general public to meetings of the committee dealing with such matters

made <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i agree with the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my noble friends amendment gives me the opportunity to explain the relationship between clauses and and the licences

provide domestic customers with compensation if the public electricity suppliers do not meet certain standards of performance in the provision of electricity supply services <e> <s> this will be supplemented by general indicators of overall performance which the suppliers will be expected to meet in areas of supply service where the payment of compensation is not appropriate <e> <s> these

standards set by the director pursuant to clauses and <e>", "<cs> i will convey them to the director <e>", "<cs> we may be able to consider that when we come to clause although i am not anticipating the debate we may have on that clause at this particular juncture <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the noble lord that we should await developments <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the noble lord about the views of many on economic sanctions which we share <e> <s> i agree too that we must wait and see what happens <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any such assurance being given <e>", "<cs> my lords again we have to wait and see what happens <e> <s> we are ready to have normal relations providing the iranian government abide by international obligations in future

my lords the net amount included in the foreign and commonwealth office estimates for the current financial year specifically for uk peacekeeping operations is million <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that my noble friend is concerned about the financial contributions <e> <s> there are various schemes for the arrangements for un peacekeeping <e> <s> some small un peacekeeping operations are financed through the united nations regular budget to which we subscribe million this year <e> <s> others are financed by special accounts and the united nations force in cyprus solely through

sympathetically any request by him for reinforcements <e> <s> we support his plan to double the number of peace monitors in namibia up to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unable to say precisely why either the soviet union or the united states does not pay <e> <s> i know that in the united states it is a matter for some discussion as to whether the paying of its dues would be possible <e> <s> i believe that it is in our interests that this matter should be taken up because certain peacekeeping operations are <e>", "<cs> my lords i know of no plan to revive the military staffs committee but i agree with the noble lord that at a time when there are increasing demands on the united nations the methods of making the contributions that all countries make to peacekeeping forces around the world should be made as effective and as proper as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer to that <e> <s> however i shall inquire and let the noble and learned lord know <e>", "<cs> i believe that the amendment is an unnecessary addition despite the noble lords wish to see the matter put beyond doubt <e>", "<cs> i certainly share the concern that the noble lord lord carter has expressed to ensure that the needs of the disabled are taken account of in the privatisation exercise <e> <s> it is for that reason as the noble lord lord carter suggested that the secretary of state and the director general are given a specific duty under clause of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord feels that that is not sufficient but i believe i can show that it follows very much the course that my noble friend lady gardner of parkes has pointed out <e>", "<cs> that is an argument that is fairly familiar <e> <s> i seem to remember that it cropped up during the course of the telecommunications bill and one or two others <e> <s> it has also cropped up as regards this bill a number of times as well <e> <s> the fact is that licence conditions are not statutory instruments in the way the noble lord wishes they were <e> <s> nevertheless i have no doubt whatsoever that if the provisions of the licence are not met or followed a great deal of concern will be raised about it <e> <s> the fact is that under the determination of disputes procedure which can be undertaken under clause there is a right for people to actually seek the kind of redress that they are looking for <e>", "<cs> i certainly understand the motives that lie behind the amendment <e> <s> despite that i do not think that it is any more appropriate <e> <s> it is also a little curious to see the amendment in the place that it is as the substance of the provision into which it is to be introduced is not concerned with charging for meters at all <e> <s> be that as it may the amendment proposes that a disabled consumer should not be charged more for a meter which has had to be specially modified to account for his disability than it would have cost him to be supplied with the unmodified meter <e> <s> the point that stems from this is the one focused on earlier by the noble lord lord carter which is that someone else would have to bear the cost <e> <s> in practice this would be the supplier and through him the generality of his customers <e> <s> the social security system is designed to meet the requirements of people who find themselves in this predicament <e> <s> we are concerned but the bill as drafted already takes account of the interest which the noble baroness advocates <e>", "<cs> i cannot give chapter and verse on which element <e> <s> there is a raft of available help under the social security system to meet this kind of concern <e> <s> i shall certainly try to find out for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first respond to the noble lords lord cledwyn of penrhos and lord bonham-carter and thank them both for their comments in support of the statement that i have repeated and indeed the steps contained within it <e> <s> i am grateful for that support <e> <s> like the noble lord lord cledwyn i believe that at what amounts to a fairly early point in this tragic tale it is difficult and would be a mistake to make judgments about what is likely to happen in the future or to try to predict a scene which changes more or less by the minute <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford has made that point on a number <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point which the noble lord raised i do not think that i can add to what i have already said in answer to the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford <e> <s> as is made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord maclehose for those comments and particularly for his support of the main issue which is that tearing up the agreement would really be disastrous <e> <s> whatever the circumstances it is much better to do all that we can to build upon what has been achieved which has been so widely acclaimed in the past <e> <s> that does not lead me to underestimate the difficulties in taking matters forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear from my noble friend that his daughter has reported that she is safe and well <e> <s> i am glad that we were able to help over that <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the introduction of a greater degree of democracy into hong kong is concerned over recent months we have been trying to introduce representative government in hong kong at a pace which commands the widest possible support in that territory <e> <s> clearly opinion in hong kong is now evolving <e> <s> we shall need to respond to that <e> <s> a number of suggestions have been made <e> <s> under the present circumstances we could not ignore a clear call from the community there for a faster pace of development than that which has hitherto been envisaged <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with all that the noble and learned lord says about the conscience of the world being outraged by what has been seen <e> <s> i can tell him that a statement was issued on th june on behalf of the united nations secretary-general which i shall certainly read out if that would be the noble and learned lords wish <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i note the views of my noble friend on that <e> <s> i can tell him that his memory of the words used in the statement is correct <e> <s> we shall look urgently and sympathetically at the scope of flexibility <e> <s> i am quite sure that the question of multiple entry is a matter that can form part of that examination <e>", "<cs> my lords there were earlier reports that there had been some jamming <e> <s> i believe that these have not been validated <e> <s> i can also tell my noble friend that the external services of the bbc have increased the amount of broadcasting in mandarin that is taking place at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give the noble lord chapter and verse on precisely where we stand <e> <s> that is obviously a most important matter <e> <s> we shall be considering ways of trying to meet the concern that he raises <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly shall do that <e> <s> as i said the security council normally addresses itself only to conflicts between states <e> <s> of course it is a fact that china is a permanent member of the security council and could exercise her veto against any attempt by that body to criticise her action <e> <s> however action in the united nations human rights machinery is another matter <e> <s> we shall certainly be considering that with our european community colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in no doubt whatever that the hong kong government are fully aware of the strength of feeling upon this issue <e> <s> it is essentially a matter for them because they enjoy a high degree of autonomy on matters of that sort <e> <s> however as party to the convention and by virtue of the extension of the united kingdoms ratification hong kong is required to implement the same controls as all other parties to the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer that is something which the hong kong government are reviewing with urgency in the light of the concerns which the noble lord and others throughout the country have expressed about this horrible trade <e> <s> on the basis of that review the hong kong government will decide what to do and we shall be very interested in that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> certainly there is concern about trafficking in ivory through the united arab emirates and we have repeatedly urged the government there to tighten controls on the trade <e> <s> we have also helped international organisations and interest groups to express their concerns to the uae authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that is something which we should like to see achieved <e> <s> however we are straying somewhat from hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that i do not know the answer to that particular point <e> <s> perhaps that is something which i can also look into <e>", "<cs> my lords any idea is worth exploring when one considers that the number of african elephants has fallen from approximately million in to about today <e> <s> what my noble friend lord caithness is trying to do in brussels today is to ensure that african elephants are put on to the appendix side of the convention of which i spoke <e> <s> we sincerely hope that that will meet my noble friends concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords i well understand the force of feeling but we are straying very widely from the question on the order paper <e> <s> that relates specifically to hong kong and the end use of the product which is of concern to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i made clear our shock and outrage at the recent events in china when i repeated my right honourable and learned friends statement to the house on th june <e> <s> our concern is all the greater because of our responsibility to hong kong <e> <s> our commitment to a secure stable and prosperous future for the territory is as strong as ever <e> <s> we look to china to stand by her obligations under the joint declaration in the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am acutely aware of the concerns expressed both in hong kong and elsewhere about the matters relating to right of abode in the united kingdom and to which the noble lord has given voice on many occasions <e> <s> recently i expressed our deep understanding and sympathy for the people of hong kong at what for them must be a very worrying time indeed <e> <s> none of the force of that is lost on me or any of my right honourable friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot go further on the matter of categories other than to say that all categories will be considered in the light of the concerns expressed and the comments of my right honourable friend the prime minister to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> it is too early to say what the answer may be because discussions are going on even today <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said all categories that includes the entire range of people in hong kong will have to be considered in this way <e> <s> that is what is presently being done and is one of the reasons why the governor is over here <e> <s> however i am not in a position to go further at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have always sought to achieve continuity over and to ensure that what is established before that date will continue to flourish after the transfer of sovereignty that is why we have worked for a basic law which carries forward the changes we plan to make before <e> <s> i am sure that the people of hong kong fully understand that <e> <s> however as i said recently under the present circumstances we could not ignore a clear call from the community for a faster pace of development than that hitherto envisaged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of that view and i am grateful to the noble lord for once more putting it forward <e> <s> yes i am aware of the criticisms from hong kong and elsewhere about the very few civil servants who have been granted citizenship under section <e> <s> again that is something which falls into the generality of categories though it has a particular significance of its own which will be considered as i have described <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord i think that it is important not to dwell on any particular category of individual at the moment <e> <s> the fact is that all aspects are being looked at <e> <s> it is a particularly difficult time to make instant judgments <e> <s> the matter must be looked at thoroughly for the benefit of all the people whom noble lords and others are keen to see protected <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving me notice of that question <e> <s> i can assure him that we shall look sympathetically at any application by chinese nationals to remain here until the situation in china becomes clearer <e> <s> no chinese nationals already living here will be required <e>", "<cs> my lords that is of course a very important consideration <e> <s> i believe that it points up many of the difficulties in trying to reach a satisfactory answer to this problem <e> <s> i shall convey the remarks that have been made this afternoon to my right honourable friends attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that fact <e> <s> i am also aware of the fact that the arrangements that have been made in this country and in portugal as regards their nationals in macau and ours in hong kong varied enormously and differently over the years <e> <s> that is why we have reached the position that we are in now <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards other nationals i am not aware of any discussions but i shall certainly bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the concerns that have been expressed about the australian decision <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that on nd may the australian government announced that they would not sign the convention because they are not satisfied that the convention will adequately protect the antarctic environment <e> <s> that was an unexpected turn of events and it leaves the government to some extent uneasy about the <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> what i said i hope is certainly meant to be a fair reflection of what the clause means in practice <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right in his interpretation of what i said meaning what the clause is intended to convey <e> <s> whether the noble lord feels that the clause does not quite convey it in that way i do not think is entirely right <e> <s> i do not believe that there is anything unusual in this <e> <s> as the noble lord said the burden is essentially on the fact that the director may as opposed to any other construction of that <e> <s> so his interpretation is correct <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i intervene before members become confused about who was asking whom and what <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord trafford <e> <s> the noble lord lord macaulay set out the correct understanding of the clause <e>", "<cs> i most certainly will <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord campbell of croy for his explanation of what lies behind his amendment <e> <s> i have to say at the outset that we do not entirely favour the drafting of the amendment but perhaps i can put that in context by also saying that there may be practical difficulties in simply extending the schemes to cover all tariff customers <e> <s> at present there are some different tariffs operated by the industry for non-domestic customers each of which varies from area board to area board <e> <s> furthermore at present many large industrial consumers take all or part of their supplies on tariff <e> <s> therefore it might be difficult if not impractical to distinguish in the bill between different tariffs on any logical or consistent basis particularly as the scales of tariffs change frequently and the situation may become even more complex after privatisation <e> <s> with those difficulties in mind our view is that a definition of the target group for the guaranteed standard scheme in terms of tariffs would be more or less impossible <e>", "<cs> i certainly appreciate the noble viscounts motives for putting forward this amendment <e> <s> however i must say to him that despite his concerns about the water bill i do not think that what he proposes is necessary <e> <s> it seems to me that the provisions which are already written into the bill ensure that an investigation by a consumers committee under clause can in fact lead to positive action <e>", "<cs> far be it from me to indicate what any committee may decide under any given set of circumstances <e> <s> however under such circumstances as these i envisage that the first course of action that it might take under that subsection would be to refer the matter back <e> <s> no doubt the committee would try to resolve the point at issue <e>", "<cs> i certainly recognise that it was made perfectly clear at an earlier stage in the bill that we would look at the whole question of public meetings <e> <s> i understand the concerns that lie behind the views of the noble lord on the matter so i hope that what i say will be taken in the context of that review <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord is pleased with the bit of information that i have been able to give him <e> <s> certainly that excellent organisation has some very promising ideas <e> <s> there are one or two difficulties over details but those are being looked at <e> <s> i very much welcome the noble lords words <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say whether that particular matter was discussed but the whole problem was certainly discussed when mr shamir was here <e> <s> so far as his visit is concerned it confirmed our good relations with israel <e> <s> the talks comprised thorough discussion of the arab-israeli dispute and other regional issues and bilateral questions <e> <s> we look forward to keeping in close touch with him <e> <s> but i am absolutely certain that the noble lords point was not lost on mr shamir <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am unable to give that information but the facts that i gave in the original answer are a shocking indictment of israeli practices <e>", "<cs> my lords i am beginning to become fairly familiar with the difficulties on both sides of that difficult issue <e> <s> that is why we have deplored violence from whatever quarter and we shall continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in close touch with the organisation at the moment <e> <s> as i indicated in answer to the noble lord lord mayhew there are one or two points to be sorted out <e> <s> but the noble lord should be aware that we also support the health projects of many non-government organisations in the occupied territories including the order of st johns clinics in gaza and the west bank save the children funds physiotherapy training and oxfam and save the children fund projects for the mentally and physically handicapped <e> <s> so there is a lot going on in addition to medical aid for palestine <e>", "<cs> yes my lords is the figure that we have <e> <s> that information came from the palestinian human rights information centre <e> <s> naturally the figures vary and many cases are never reported <e> <s> but as i said whatever the source or accuracy they are close enough to be a shocking indictment of what has gone on <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is narrowly worded in connection with injuries and deaths to children and the medical aspects <e> <s> i shall certainly look at that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the aid and trade provision soft loan facility was launched in for a five-year period <e> <s> a mid-term review is currently under way to assess the achievements of the scheme so far and make recommendations for the future after the present facility has expired <e> <s> a decision on the future of the scheme is unlikely before the autumn <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly aware of that view but of course that is something which ministers will wish to consider as they review all the relevant aspects of the current scheme before reaching a conclusion later in the year <e>", "<cs> my lords the criteria are fairly complex <e> <s> i do not think that it would be possible just now to go into the full detail for which the noble baroness asks <e> <s> so far as concerns the alleviation of the poorest the answer is yes to a very large extent but there will of course be other methods of providing aid which are particularly targeted on the very poorest conditions <e> <s> i do not think that one <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of that point and representations on the commercial and industrial aspects of the scheme have been made by british industry <e> <s> the views of those who have made representations will be taken into account <e> <s> the autumn is not too far away <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with all those who have paid tribute to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for providing this opportuniy to debate hong kong at a time when the thoughts of so many people in this country are acutely focused on the territory and her people <e> <s> the debate has once again demonstrated the experience concern and sympathy which your lordships bring to bear on matters affecting hong kong and has provided much food for thought <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right to draw attention to those facts but it is a fact also that the crime of genocide comprises two elements the intent to destroy and one or more of the acts as listed in the convention which the noble lord has partially quoted from <e> <s> under the convention conspiracy to commit genocide is punishable as well as the act itself <e> <s> of course we condemn iraqs human rights record but the evidence we possess does not back up genocide under the un convention however much the noble lord may think it does <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it genocide has to comprise those two parts to which i <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned there has certainly been considerable press reporting of the forcible removal of iraqi kurds from qala diza and also from rania <e> <s> the iraqis have denied any mass relocation but they have admitted to what they call some local resettlement in north-east iraq on security and anti-smuggling as well as humanitarian grounds <e> <s> as i said in answer to a question some weeks ago we have urged the iraqis to allow british diplomats and journalists to visit the area to see for themselves what is happening <e> <s> but we have made quite clear to the iraqis that despite the proximity of these towns to the iraq-iran border there is no justification whatever for mass deportations <e> <s> britain and other western countries took the lead in co-sponsoring a firm and unambiguous resolution on iraq at the un chr <e> <s> it is disappointing that an iraqi procedural motion blocked that resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows full well all exports of defence-related equipment to iran and iraq whether or not they stem from an arms fair are governed by very strict guidelines <e> <s> they prohibit the supply of lethal equipment which would significantly enhance the military capability of either side to prolong or exacerbate any conflict <e> <s> whether or not companies attended that arms fair would be no guarantee of licences being agreed for export <e>", "<cs> my lords a wide range of equipment can be used in a variety of different ways <e> <s> i do not have a list with me but i shall look at it to see whether i can let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know where that particular fax stemmed from but i have not seen it <e> <s> that claim which i have heard on a number of occasions and which was referred to earlier stemmed largely from the press and we have seen nothing to justify it <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of my knowledge i have not seen it but i shall check to discover whether it was received <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the noble baronesss question off the top of my head <e> <s> we must look at the convention not only from a practical but also from a legal point of view <e> <s> in answering the first supplementary question of the noble lord lord kilbracken i pointed out that these two elements the intent and then the acts must be complied with if a breach of that convention is to be proved <e> <s> the fact is that we do not believe that the two elements the intent to destroy and breaching of those acts has taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly it is quite possible that chemical weapons were used and we utterly deplore that fact <e> <s> on th november last year my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state made a clear condemnation of that <e> <s> we were horrified by the barbaric acts which took place during the iran/iraq conflict at halabja and we played a leading role in drafting the tough un resolution which followed <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true <e> <s> it is made even more difficult when the crime must be supported not only by intent but also by the actions to which i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question which the noble lord might address to the arms manufacturers <e>", "<cs> my lords the urgent need for a solution to lebanons crisis is reguarly discussed at meetings of the twelve <e> <s> we and our european partners fully support the efforts of the committee of three set up by the arab league summit in casablanca as was made clear in the statement issued by foreign ministers of the twelve on th june <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am aware of the worries about the cease-fire being broken <e> <s> however i believe that my noble friend should have more faith and hope that the committee of three will produce a solution <e> <s> the fact that it has produced a staged plan is encouraging and it certainly has our support <e> <s> it is a high-level plan involving two kings and one president and a great deal of serious effort is being made to meet my noble friends concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords we are too well aware of the tragedies referred to by the noble lord <e> <s> for that reason it is important that the work being carried out by the committee of three should be given a fair chance <e> <s> indeed already there are signs of progress <e> <s> at a meeting today in oran in morocco no doubt the heads of state of the committee of three will discuss the outcome of the first round of their foreign ministers contacts <e> <s> we should give it every wish for good speed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have with me any facts about a monitoring force <e> <s> as regards hostages we continue to seek information on their safety and whereabouts <e> <s> our ambassador in beirut was recently following up reports which had been received <e> <s> we keep in regular contact with the americans and with other countries whose nationals are held hostage <e> <s> their future is extremely difficult to predict but we do our very best <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that point of view <e> <s> however i do not believe that it is helpful to speculate <e> <s> we continue to call on those holding hostages and those who may have influence on them to release those hostages now on humanitarian grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords the sooner it is brought to a conclusion the better <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i broadly agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is important to ensure that the ceasefire is upheld <e> <s> the fact that it is not upheld goes to show my noble friend the very real difficulties that this sort of matter involves <e> <s> that is why we have faith in the committee of three and why as i said in answer to an earlier supplementary question the meeting of the heads of state in oran today may bear some fruit <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be very careful to distinguish between the worst possible case the armageddon scenario which we discussed during that debate and the present circumstances <e> <s> while those circumstances are worrying they are certainly far from catastrophic <e> <s> what is needed now is for the international community to rally round hong kong in order to help restore its confidence <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot provide the precise details which my noble friend seeks <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable and learned friend will certainly be going to listen <e> <s> that is the prime purpose of his visit <e> <s> as regards <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware and my right honourable and learned friend is aware that he goes to hong kong at a time of great anxiety <e> <s> nevertheless it is extremely important that he goes there to hear the views expressed to him directly by the hong kong people <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is in a sense muddling two different aspects <e> <s> one is the need to try to restore confidence in hong kong so that those who make hong kong so prosperous remain there <e> <s> the second aspect is what to do if things ultimately go wrong <e> <s> as i said general discussions on that possibility have already taken place and have elicited sympathy <e> <s> no doubt they will continue <e> <s> i said on st june that if the worst comes to the worst and the future position in hong kong becomes untenable the british government would be clearly under a strong moral obligation to act and no doubt the international community would be mobilised to do what the noble lord seeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that will be discussed when my right honourable and learned friend goes to hong kong <e> <s> my noble friend is absolutely right in saying that it is far too early to do that sort of detailed planning <e> <s> what we need is a general attitude of sympathy and support for hong kong and that is what we have already achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not misunderstand the question at all <e> <s> the noble lord perhaps slightly misunderstands the problem <e> <s> we have to try to meet two concerns <e> <s> the first is the immediate concern of restoring confidence in hong kong so that the brain drain about which the noble lord is concerned can be diminished <e> <s> and looking to the future we must discuss with others how best we can meet the scenario which we all wish not to happen but on which inevitably peoples minds are focused at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to answer for the opposition <e> <s> if anybody wants to talk to the opposition that can no doubt be arranged through their channels <e> <s> the government regularly have talks with people from hong kong whether they be from the hong kong government or elsewhere <e> <s> we shall continue to do precisely that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness seems to misunderstand the nature of the problem <e> <s> she seeks an instantaneous solution to a problem which is not even likely to arise in its ultimate form before and hopefully will never arise as my noble friend lord renton said <e> <s> therefore to go into the kind of detail which she and others are seeking is not sensible <e> <s> we have to try to arrange now through discussions with other countries some mutual understanding of the nature of the problem so that ultimately if things go seriously wrong that can lead to the detailed planning which she seeks <e>", "<cs> my lords the important thing is for us all to strive to make sure that hong kong is a success not only up until but beyond that year <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to answer at this dispatch box for taiwan <e> <s> i suggest that the answer to the noble lords question lies more in taiwan than here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable and learned friend will refer in general terms as i have done to the discussions which have taken place <e> <s> however i ask my noble friend to understand that to go into the kind of detail which he seeks is asking the impossible <e> <s> we have eight years to wait <e> <s> all kinds of things can change between now and then <e> <s> while the point that he makes is a serious one to get into that detail really is not sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be associated with the remarks of my noble friend lord montgomery and also the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> one hundred years is a very good start <e> <s> we look forward to a further years <e> <s> i join with both noble lords in wishing the ipu every success for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend that there are commercial opportunities in madagascar and i can assure him that british companies are following developments there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course aware of the poverty and the epidemics in madagascar <e> <s> our contributions are largely made through the international development association which is part of the world bank as the noble lord will know and through the european development fund <e> <s> indeed approaches have been made to those organisations by the malagasy authorities <e> <s> as i understand it our contributions to those two bodies amount to about million <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the total figure in this respect <e> <s> as i have said our contribution amounts to about million <e> <s> however so far as concerns our bilateral technical co-operation programme which is our only bilateral mechanism for providing aid and is not focused quite in the way suggested by the noble lord that amounts to about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that on her visit my noble friend will take the opportunity to see many of those ministers and others who are associated with the development of madagascar <e> <s> i am also sure that she will have noted my noble friends remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps that is one of the reasons why we try to focus our aid in rather different directions <e> <s> it does not mean to say that the sort of development which is taking place and the opportunities referred to by my noble friend lord merrivale are not important <e> <s> that is why individual british companies are looking to try to develop them <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that the figures quoted by the noble lord are indeed disturbing but there is more than one source for the kind of figures he used <e> <s> it is difficult to get the true picture <e> <s> however i certainly agree that what he has described is a deplorable state of affairs <e> <s> i can assure him that we shall continue to press the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord will appreciate that many countries are keen to see a resolution of this tragic state of affairs <e> <s> we have been closely engaged in the matter as have the americans which is extremely important <e> <s> many countries in the arab world are also involved <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a danger on this sort of question that we become involved in a major debate on the whole arab-israeli conflict <e> <s> it has happened fairly regularly recently <e> <s> the question relates strictly to the matter of schools <e>", "<cs> my lords the excuse put forward by the israeli government is that it is a matter of security for them <e> <s> we understand that they have security concerns <e> <s> however i do not believe that what they have done with their schools can in any sense be considered as some sort of security risk <e>", "<cs> my lords those figures are broadly correct as i said the other day <e> <s> on cultural and educational links between israel and this country the british council is active in israel and there is a budget of million for <e> <s> it is important to bear in mind however that withdrawal of that type of aid would not help to solve the problems of the occupied territories <e> <s> that type of aid is more a force for good and understanding than anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but i cannot accept and nor can the government that the closure of the schools was necessary from a security point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware that mr shamirs visit confirmed our good relations with israel <e> <s> we had thorough talks covering the arab-israel situation and other regional issues and bilateral questions <e> <s> i can assure him that we shall of course continue to remain in close touch <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first of all thank both noble lords opposite for their kind tributes to my right honourable and learned friend <e> <s> his was not an easy task to undertake but i am grateful as i am sure he will be for the kind remarks which have been made about his visit <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point that it is important to examine further the scope for the commonwealth to play the role which he seeks <e> <s> we are in a sense at the beginning of this operation <e> <s> as my right honourable and learned friend made plain the matter will be raised in paris <e> <s> indeed it has already been raised <e> <s> my right honourable friend the prime minister has already indicated that this will need to be discussed at the commonwealth heads of government meeting in october <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord maclehose for welcoming what is contained in the statement what my right honourable and learned friend said about the vietnamese boat people and what is being looked at in terms of flexibility <e> <s> as i indicated to the noble lord lord cledwyn and i hope the noble lord will forgive me if i do not go into detail what i said when i repeated the statement earlier and spoke from this dispatch box was that all this is being looked at and it is to be hoped that an announcement will be made before too long <e> <s> i certainly agree with him that it is important to build on the magnificent achievement in the joint declaration and as i have indicated stiffen the basic law where it is practical to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends interpretation of the mobilisation of international support is broadly correct <e> <s> of course if matters were to go so horribly wrong as he envisages there would also be a commitment upon us <e> <s> indeed my right honourable and learned friend made that perfectly plain on one or two occasions when he spoke in hong kong <e> <s> however it is extremely important that the ground is prepared for the kind of detailed work which we all hoped it would not ultimately be necessary to bring into effect <e> <s> that is why my right honourable and learned friend has taken the step so far of stimulating interest in this serious problem in the united states and in the european community and among commonwealth countries <e> <s> therefore i very much take the point made by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for his very wise words <e> <s> i should say however that i fully expect him to be with us in contributing to our debates in the way that he always does <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for his tributes to my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary <e> <s> i too should like to be associated with his words as regards the attitude of the official opposition and that of the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> as he says it is important to remember that this is a time for cool heads both here and in hong kong <e> <s> it is an extremely difficult issue and one which will not be solved overnight <e> <s> that is precisely why my right honourable and learned friend undertook his visit to hong kong he wished to hear opinion at first hand <e> <s> i am also sure that we must consider the matter coolly and carefully and give it all consideration as indeed is being done at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i said on a previous day that work on the basic law had been suspended <e> <s> that position holds good at the moment but of course we shall need to consider how to take forward the points that my right honourable and learned friend made in his statement when he said that we have to look at certain articles of that basic law and will need to make representations to the chinese authorities about it in the way that we have played a part in this matter throughout <e> <s> that is a matter which is under consideration at the moment <e> <s> i cannot say when the work will restart <e> <s> the noble baroness will appreciate why it has been suspended in the meantime <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern of people in hong kong who are looking for an assurance <e> <s> the noble baroness is suggesting <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will realise that it is impossible for me to look into the future in relation to taiwan <e> <s> as he is aware we do not have diplomatic relations with taiwan <e> <s> i am equally aware that the people of hong kong and the international community as a whole will understand that taiwan might have some role to play in the future but that is not a point for me <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for his words <e> <s> i am glad that all sides of your lordships house have been able to support my noble friends measure <e> <s> i very much endorse what he has said and i would add that it has been something of a model for short speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that if we were to remove this sort of support then i think it is felt by many that it would do more harm than good <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly often expressed as a view <e> <s> so far as concerns israel we are committed to its right to secure existence but israels security is not enhanced by either a refusal to recognise palestinian rights or by the sort of actions we have seen in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will have noted my noble friends remarks <e> <s> the fact is that we deplore the actions which have prevented these schools from opening and we shall continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the noble lord that those agencies and others have done a great deal to try to help the situation <e> <s> we have regular contact with them through the overseas development administration but i cannot say what recent representations have been made <e> <s> however i shall certainly inquire into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand that point which is why we and the have made our views known on several occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords on many occasions over the past few weeks i have made clear from this dispatch box the governments views and i hold to those views <e>", "<cs> my lords the soviet union is the only member of the warsaw pact to have admitted possessing a chemical weapons capability <e> <s> as published in the statement on the defence estimates we have good reason to believe that contrary to soviet claims the soviet union has stationed chemical weapons in eastern europe and that such weapons have also been produced by other members of the warsaw pact <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that verification is one of the difficulties but the united kingdom has been active in the geneva negotiations on a comprehensive world-wide verifiable ban <e> <s> as he says complex issues remain especially on the question of verification <e>", "<cs> my lords if there were no talks i suspect that there would be even less progress <e> <s> we have played a positive role as co-ordinator of the western group <e> <s> my honourable friend the minister of state at the foreign office spoke at geneva on th june <e> <s> he underlined our commitment to the negotiations referred to the improved climate for arms control and gave details of the united kingdoms work on verification issues including our programme of trial challenge inspections at military facilities <e> <s> that information may go some way towards helping my noble friend lord cork and orrery <e>", "<cs> my lords the soviet union has the worlds largest and most sophisticated chemical weapons capability <e> <s> the soviet stated stockpile figure which is tonnes of toxic agent is several times lower than western estimates <e> <s> the figure that my noble friend gave is within the range of possibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords the libyan chemical weapons programme as thought to be the case by those who made those claims is a disturbing one given its links with terrorism <e> <s> i assure my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be the case which is why we have drawn attention to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord is well aware of the governments views on the issue in general and the benefits to be had from an international conference <e> <s> that is set out quite clearly in the ec declaration <e> <s> as regards disarray i hope that the noble lord will be aware that it is not necessarily now the case that the restrictive conditions approved by the likud central committee on th july will not be translated into israeli government policy <e> <s> i very much welcome reports that the israeli cabinet have reaffirmed mr shamirs election proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite understand the noble lords point of view but the fact is that talking in general does not do damage provided that the talking is designed to try to bring an end to the kind of conflict that we see <e> <s> as to the meeting on th july between bassam abu sharif and my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary that was certainly not an upgrading of our relations with the plo <e> <s> it was not a full-scale meeting but a short call to reinforce our message that the plo must stick to the path of moderation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot tell the noble lord when the elections will be but i shall try to find out <e> <s> i welcome as do other noble lords reports that israeli plans for the progressive opening of schools with effect from nd july have begun to be put into operation <e> <s> we welcome the fact that some or perhaps even all of them have reopened <e> <s> i take note of the noble lords point about universities as well <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all too well aware of the difficulties <e> <s> what the noble lord says about the history of that part of the world is all too true <e> <s> however where we can try to use our influence to bring an end to the difficulties we must continue to do so <e> <s> that is precisely what the european council declaration strives to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords we deplore violence from whichever quarter it comes <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely what the declaration by the european community tries to achieve <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the noble baroness for not having heard her move the amendment <e> <s> however i hope that she will forgive me if i having heard some of the other comments which have been made comment briefly upon it <e> <s> i had a certain amount of experience of dealing with this subject some years ago in the department of health and social security <e> <s> while i understand and have sympathy with the underlying concern which she has in putting forward the amendment there may be some difficulty with what seems to me to be the looseness with which the first part of her new clause is drafted in particular the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with care to the remarks of my noble friend and others who have spoken on the subject <e> <s> i recognise that this is the kind of issue which creates a great deal of division <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord mccarthy will recognise that other matters affect people of other religions which are to some extent acknowledged in the way that we allow them for example the moslems to carry out certain activities such as the slaughter of animals <e> <s> perhaps we might not all agree with those practices <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house that may be the case <e> <s> so far as i am aware there is no compulsion on anybody other than through the employer to wear a form of helmet <e> <s> as concerns sikhs i genuinely believe that there are special circumstances which need to be addressed <e> <s> that is precisely what the bill does <e>", "<cs> my lords one reason for my wishing to take part in the debate is that i was the minister in the department of health and social security in and for part of most closely <e>", "<cs> my lords let us look at the progress made along that path everything from the world-wided eradication of that one-time scourge smallpox to the availability now of the heart and lung transplants which were referred to by my noble friend the duke of norfolk <e> <s> those are advances from which we have all benefited or stand to benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords work on the genes was done in this country to the best of my knowledge <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend the chief whip will forgive me if i ask my noble friend lord brabazon whether he does not agree that there were remarkably few options open to us in dealing with this terrible problem <e> <s> as my noble friend is well aware i was closely associated with the problem for some considerable time <e> <s> the problems last summer were acute beyond belief <e> <s> there were occasions when the arrival rate during the period of favourable winds to which the noble lord lord maclehose has referred was such that there was nowhere in hong kong to put those people <e> <s> that was a tragedy in itself <e>", "<cs> my lords of the issues of burning concern in hong kong at the moment i should like to refer to two the vietnamese boat people and almost as briefly the process of democratisation <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend foresaw i should like to deal with one type of complementary medicine that was referred to by the noble earl when he introduced the debate namely chiropractic <e> <s> my interest almost inevitably stems in part from personal experience <e> <s> i have undergone that technique to relieve back pain successfully i might add on more than one occasion <e> <s> but my interest also comes from the fact that for two years i was a minister in the department of health and social security <e> <s> during that time alternative medicine as i think it was then called was part of my policy area <e> <s> there is a third connection in that my brother is a practitioner of chiropractic <e> <s> naturally much of his enthusiasm has rubbed off on me let alone his excellent treatment <e> <s> however i am not here to give a commercial for him <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether or not the rate of diagnosis in scotland is in any sense comparable with the figures that she may have with her for england <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only briefly strongly to support this bill and in doing so i apologise to my noble friend and to your lordships for not having put my name on the list of speakers <e> <s> i had my name down earlier but thought that i should not be back in time to take part in the debate so took it off <e> <s> in the event the earlier business went on rather longer than expected <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall the auld report which gave rise to the earlier bill and nine days of debate in your lordships house <e> <s> can he say whether that report still forms the basis of her majestys governments consideration of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that i shall follow many of the remarks and aspirations which the noble lord lord maclehose with all his experience made plain in his speech <e> <s> i warmly support the bill <e> <s> i hope that it has a rapid and unhindered passage through your lordships house <e> <s> as we have heard the haemorrhage of talent from hong kong covering many aspects and sectors of its life and society has been an increasing worry over recent years <e> <s> of course it is true as my noble friend lord ferrers said when introducing the bill that hong kong has never been a truly static society indeed people have always come and gone <e> <s> however recent circumstances have increased the number of emigrants to truly frightening and damaging proportions <e> <s> if hong kongs economic position its stability and the skill of its administration are to be retained this wastage must at least be slowed down and it is to be hoped stopped <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene for a moment <e> <s> it is illuminating to hear what he has to say <e> <s> i wonder whether he could tell the house if he has visited hong kong and if he has when his last visit was <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble lord lord monkswell and i studied what he said at second reading <e> <s> what i fail to understand is his assertion that in some way others would be better suited and better fitted than the governor to decide between two people who might have the same number of points <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to deal with one fairly narrow subject which i hope will form part of the consideration now being given to the future shape of the armed forces <e> <s> it has been argued by some and i tend to share the view that difficult though it might be to predict the final outcome of events unfolding now in europe one factor seems pretty clear we shall require efficient well equipped and above all flexible forces for the future <e> <s> they will be forces which can react to any threat in europe or worldwide <e> <s> therefore instead of placing reliance so heavily on armour tracked artillery and so on much more suited to the european theatre we should in future place more emphasis on airborne airmobile and amphibious forces <e> <s> it is to the airborne and airmobile elements that i should like to address my remarks this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i am a little curious about this amendment after having heard the noble lord lord carmichael explain it <e> <s> the various items which are referred to in clause of the bill cover a whole range of different matters <e> <s> they deal with the economy employment skills for self-employment industrial efficiency and the improvement of the environment <e> <s> surely it is the case that each of those elements in an individual way and in a collective way forms part of the social development of rural areas which the noble lord has referred to <e> <s> i would argue that it is only through the success of these individual elements and through the success of their coming together that the social development which the noble lord seeks in his amendment comes about <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree i that she could usefully bear in mind when encouraging the european commission to bring forward an amendment that several of the species in schedule to the wildlife and countryside act are preyed upon by these species which are now to be afforded further protection in part ii of schedule <e> <s> is not that in itself a major nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak but having heard what has been said i shall do so briefly <e> <s> i was involved until just over a year ago with much of what is now contained in the order and with the ideas that led to it <e> <s> in view of the remarks of the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs that this was <e>"]
