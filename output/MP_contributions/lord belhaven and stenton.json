["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply but can he give the house any assurance that the rate of subsidy will continue in line with the rate of inflation and will not push the price of maintaining these airports in remote areas beyond the rate of inflation which we already have <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to follow my noble friend lord morris in referring to this as a tawdry little bill that is not really the way to refer to any bill which the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe has in good faith brought before your lordships house <e> <s> before leaving my noble friends speech i would tell him that i was forced to box as a boy and certainly that used to happen in schools <e> <s> i was not directly forced but i was in the sense that my courage was challenged by an older boy <e> <s> i went into the ring and boxed and thank god i was bad at it <e> <s> that is not to say that had i been good at it i would have finished up punch-drunk because with my background i would not have been drawn into professional boxing and i remind the house that the bill is about professional not amateur boxing <e> <s> amateur boxing would still be legal and in my view it should remain legal because however stupid it may be the citizen should be allowed to do what he likes <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that when i was running a small hotel business in the highlands quite recently we had to answer questions from four tourist boards the british tourist authority the scottish tourist board the highlands and islands development board and the mid-argyll tourist board <e> <s> is there any possibility of doing something about this sort of situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lady elliot for initiating this debate <e> <s> it is certainly timely and i am sorry it has taken her so long to get the subject discussed in the house but better late than never <e> <s> i hope your lordships will forgive me if i do not follow most noble lords into the realms of agriculture <e> <s> i was a farmer for years but that was some time ago and my main interest for the last seven years has been as a hotel keeper in the island of islay <e> <s> i hope noble lords will forgive me if in a limited debate i confine myself to that small part of the highlands and i hope that a brief exposure of the difficulties being encountered in the island of islay may be helpful as islays problems are not islays alone but reflect in miniature the very serious economic state of the many small and isolated communities in the highlands and islands of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name of the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply can he say whether her majestys government consider that intention to be enough <e> <s> because this matter has been going on for years and surely reciprocity at least between the two countries should happen now <e> <s> is it not about time that her majestys government were a little firmer with the government of the republic of ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that the glc has a continuing policy of giving grants to all sorts of questionable organisations and publications and that this is scandalising the hard-pressed ratepayers of london who see their money being used for openly immoral purposes <e> <s> this is a matter <e>", "<cs> which must concern all the people in the country and not just the people of london <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply which i think is a little more optimistic than is justified <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that in the islands of islay and jura alone with a population of only just over out of nine distilleries two have closed down in the last year and of the seven left two have ceased producing and this has caused redundancies so far with no doubt more to come <e> <s> can my noble friend tell me what in the governments view is the effect on this situation of the successive rises in whisky duty which we have had over the last few years and whether her majestys government intend to continue along this path <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to follow the noble lord lord jenkins of putney who has just sat down <e> <s> i always had the impression that the noble lord was against war but in a sense he seems this evening to be declaring war upon these benches <e> <s> certainly we cannot say we have not been warned <e> <s> unlike the noble lord i have not been a member of a trade union ever apart from membership of the national farmers union which i do not think qualifies and i have never been an employer in a big way <e> <s> therefore i want to take up your lordships time for only a very few minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend explain who the front-line states are and what swapo is <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend prepared to do anything about the proliferation of tourist boards which i mentioned in this house about nine months ago <e> <s> is he aware that when kept a small hotel in the hebrides i had to deal with four tourist boards <e> <s> is this not rather a waste of money and government paper <e> <s> could not the number of tourist boards dealing with various areas of the united kingdom be cut and therefore money be saved for other purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that basically very encouraging reply <e> <s> can he say when the major works on the m and the m will be completed and can he tell the house whether some of the money earmarked for the railways may instead be used to hurry up the improvements to motorways and the construction of new motorways <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> would he think that in view of the campaign which is proceeding in certain quarters in this country to deprive very large numbers of irish residents here of the vote there is something that the proponents of this campaign have not thought through <e> <s> the results of doing this would be rather deplorable <e> <s> would it not be a good idea if her majestys government pressed the government in dublin whichever one it is to be to get on with implementing their intention of giving british subjects the vote and of giving them the same treatment in ireland as irish people receive in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that my question is a matter of principle and that it would not matter if there was only one british subject resident in ireland <e> <s> the principle is the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful as i am sure we all are to the noble lord lord tanlaw for raising this subject and for getting it on the order paper at such a reasonable time of day and i must say not before time <e> <s> i lived in the island of isla until just over a year ago <e> <s> the situation when i left there was critical and i have no reason to believe it is any better yet <e> <s> i never thought i should be attending even a short debate in your lordships house in which i would agree with practically everything that had been said including every word uttered by the noble lord lord ross <e>", "<cs> i agree with some of the things the noble lord says but i do not usually agree with everything <e> <s> the only trouble my lords is that i have been left as what i would call the last lay or back bench speaker with very little to say because your lordships have summed up the situation so well <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very much the way people feel when they live in such an <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> can he tell the house whether there is any truth in the allegations which have been made in certain quarters that rural kiosks will be removed because they do not pay the operators <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer and i may have to break my rule to tell her that i put my question down long before our discussion last week <e> <s> does she think ministers could help when certain noble lords are flagrantly out of order by answering my lords that is not a question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> can he say whether the government are making a profit out of this <e> <s> because i gather that they are not doing so <e> <s> if they are not can he say whether the government will consider either increasing the amount payable for the licence or abolishing it altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply and for the not very encouraging nature of it apart from the highlands and islands development board which i know does a good job <e> <s> i regret that i cannot congratulate him or through him his right honourable friend on increasing the whisky tax yesterday <e> <s> may i ask two supplementary questions first have the government any firm plans to introduce new industry to those areas which are affected by the destructive attitude of the treasury to the whisky industry <e> <s> secondly have the government any plans for a free port in the highlands and islands area <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that quite reassuring reply <e> <s> i wonder <e>", "<cs> my lords would the fact that pakistan has taken in something like million refugees from afghanistan influence her majestys governments view on the stand for human rights in pakistan <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of my sympathy with my noble friend lord kilmany in so far as on i think the crossing he has mentioned about two years ago i was nearly killed for the reasons which he mentions in his question and that it is only by the grace of god that i am here to ask my noble friend this supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply which is in the short form that seems to have become usual since we resumed on monday <e> <s> do her majestys government accept the recommendation of the commission that mandatory ethnic records should be kept by all firms <e> <s> if so does this include records of people of english scottish irish welsh and jewish race <e> <s> what will be the position of people of mixed race people who like some cousins of mine have an english father and a chinese mother <e> <s> can my noble friend estimate what the cost of these proposals will be first to the taxpayer and secondly to industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that extremely encouraging reply <e> <s> in view of the figures which he has given can he say whether a consequence may be some relief for those plants in british steel which have been threatened with closure over the last few years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that extremely encouraging reply <e> <s> i wonder whether he could give the house comparable figures for ireland which used to

whether anything is being done to increase the amount of legal parking space available in central london <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply which is quite encouraging <e> <s> is my noble friend aware of the anxiety and dissatis-faction felt by the victims of these assaults and their colleagues in that they feel for some reason that no one in authority will listen to them although it sounds from my noble friends answer that possibly they do <e> <s> would my noble friend urge those in authority however to pay heed to the views of the rank and file the conductors and the drivers who are the victims of this lawlessness and would my noble friend himself consider talking to some of them <e>", "<cs> my lords in the various discussions which my noble friend told me about are the victims of these assaults being consulted in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not think that the trade unions might help the situation which is so deplored by noble lords on the other side <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is debating a very serious problem and it is right that the noble lord lord cledwyn should draw our attention to it but i think it is fair in considering the terms of the motion to ask not just what her majestys government are doing about unemployment but what her majestys opposition are doing <e> <s> having listened over years to many debates of this kind in this house which have been moved by the opposition i have never in my experience come across a worse case of the pot calling the kettle black <e> <s> therefore i come back to the question what contribution is the labour party making to the problem of reducing unemployment <e> <s> i do not just mean words <e> <s> we can talk until we are black in the face and make every sort of suggestion but in this situation there is surely an obligation on those who have power and although not in office the labour party certainly has power to do all they can to mitigate the situation regardless of party advantage or the prospect of office <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i should also like to pay tribute to the courtesy i have always met from bus-drivers conductors and other people employed by london transport <e> <s> this is a fairly general experience and considering the job they do i think their good manners and friendliness deserve all credit <e> <s> while on this subject i should like to pay tribute to bus drivers in particular who have always seemed to me to be the safest drivers on the roads of this city <e> <s> if only car drivers lorry drivers and i would single out in particular coach drivers could drive half as well as london bus drivers london would be a much safer place to go about in <e>", "<cs> my lords i may say that we have just listened to two very powerful speeches from two noble baronesses and before i begin my speech i should like to congratulate them <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate my noble friend lord renton on raising this subject <e> <s> i think that it is high time it was raised <e> <s> the last time i took part in a debate on civil defence

lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend very much for that clear answer <e> <s> i do not suppose that he can do so but

misrepresentation of the electorate or at any rate the more gullible members of the electorate <e> <s> can my noble friend also tell me whether any of these <e>", "<cs> my lords would sanctions against south africa help the unemployment situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord taylor has raised a very important issue in the debate and i am sure that we are all grateful to him for giving the house an opportunity to discuss it <e> <s> i feel that i can make a very modest contribution if only because in the past years i have spent seven years in the island of islay in the hebrides and five in south-east england so to some extent i have a foot in each camp <e> <s> however like the noble lord lord grimond i must confine my remarks to scotland because unfortunately i do not know much about northern england except when i go through it when travelling from scotland to london <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stallard in an excellent and knowledgeable speech has drawn your lordships attention to what i think is a very important problem of our age <e> <s> i do not intend to follow the knowledgeable noble lords who have spoken before me but i intend to read

hear what my noble friend has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords as the second member of your lordships select committee apart from the noble viscount lord hood our very able chairman to speak i should like to say a few words to your lordships about our consideration of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him whether he saw a programme on i think channel last week where a police officer said that when he travelled in a police car on a motorway he was travelling in a small bubble of law observance <e> <s> will my noble friend consider the suggestion that more police cars should travel on the motorways and fewer lurk on bridges and in lay-bys <e> <s> although they may catch one or two offenders by doing that by actually driving on the motorways they may prevent far more offences taking place because they are happening all the time <e>",

saying very much of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reassuring reply <e> <s> did her majestys government take any steps to counter what one could only call rumours in the press and the media that what i say in my original question was the case that her majestys government had imposed such restrictions on the dalai lama <e> <s> people including myself believed that and i thought that the dalai lama believed it also <e> <s> it created a bad impression <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> perhaps i may also add my congratulations to him

result on the value of the shares following upon the actions of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me why one should be clamped merely for parking in the wrong place if one is not clamped when one should not be there at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords in thanking the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for initiating this short debate <e> <s> i think it is right and fitting that her majestys opposition should draw your lordships attention to this grave issue in which the honour and integrity of our country are at stake <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate my noble friend lord willoughby de broke on a quite outstanding maiden speech <e> <s> if i had known what he was going to say i might have kept my seat and shut up but perhaps i shall say what he said a little more forcefully because mine is not a maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords we have just listened to a very impressive and moving speech of the highest standard of debate in your lordships house <e> <s> my only regret is that while i normally wholeheartedly agree with the noble viscount lord tonypandy i cannot entirely agree with him on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords it is most difficult for me to add much to what has already been said so very eloquently by every noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e> <s> i shall try to find examples and write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken i wish to thank my noble friend lord home for initiating the debate and for allowing us to speak on this very wide subject <e> <s> my only intention is to draw your lordships attention to the situation of poland <e> <s> in this respect i have to declare an interest as i have done before <e> <s> i do not know how many times i have to do so <e> <s> my wife is polish <e> <s> beyond that possibly the whole house and the whole nation should declare an interest in the matter of poland <e>", "<cs> my lords is my
