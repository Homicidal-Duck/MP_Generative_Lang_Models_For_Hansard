["<cs> my lords may i correct the noble earl <e> <s> my recollection is that i did not say a freeze on prices would not reduce production but would not solve the problem of over-production <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl for his final remarks and indeed for all his speech <e> <s> i am also grateful as i know is the whole house to all those who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> it is always invidious to single out any individual <e>", "<cs> my lords we have all listened with enormous interest and appreciation to the words of the noble lord lord home of the hirsel <e> <s> he has had vast experience of these matters and he has given us a deep and to my mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that when this debate is finished the present foreign secretary will consider it timely because i hope it will be helpful to him <e> <s> i say that because i have the feeling i do not wish to embarrass him and i know that praise from this side of the house is frequently an embarrassment that he and many of us here are basically on the same side <e> <s> now he in his speech also said many things of very great interest <e> <s> he said at the beginning for instance that we should not forget that a great deal of progress has been made over the last years and that a great many efforts have been made by successive and different governments <e> <s> that is perfectly right <e> <s> we would be fooling ourselves if we did not accept however reluctantly that a very large measure of the progress that has been made in rhodesia and it is remarkable progress as the noble lord lord home of the hirsel has said has only come about because of violence because of guerrilla activity because of freedom fighting <e> <s> i have a very unhappy feeling that had it not been for mr nkomo mr mugabe and their efforts we would find the bishop mr sithole and many others still languishing in detention and mr smith and his colleagues in control as they were a few years ago <e> <s> that is not a debating point it is of vital importance to the whole of our future policy <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i think it is getting happily rather closer to that not sufficiently widely accepted virtue of realism realism to achieve the best results for all those concerned <e> <s> i believe also that the armed forces must be put fairly and squarely under the control of the elected government of the country <e> <s> if those three things were done there is a good possibility exploited by the skill and patience of the noble lord lord harlech and the noble lord lord carrington that a solution could be reached <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who sits on these benches and as a very old supporter of the eec may i be allowed to add my voice to those who have welcomed the governments line <e>", "<cs> my lords all the three speeches which we have listened to so far have as one would have expected been models of balance and restraint <e> <s> i hope that the rest of the speeches including that of my noble friend lord paget will be in the same mould <e>", "<cs> but my lords whether or not the speeches which follow will be of that sort there is no point in closing our eyes to the fact that throughout the country as a whole feelings are running very high about rhodesia and there is inevitably a natural inclination to look for the angels and the devils the good and the bad and to pinpoint on one person all that is good or all that is bad <e> <s> that is a fatal error to fall into <e> <s> i am not suggesting for a moment that the noble lord lord carrington is doing <e>", "<cs> my lords they have been refused <e>", "<cs> my noble friend calls it nonsense <e> <s> he should go and look for himself and see the situation <e> <s> the third thing that will happen is that the commonwealth may well break up <e> <s> the commonwealth has shown its strength during these last months as an enormous factor in bringing together the disputants in this cause <e> <s> i think it is right to say that without the commonwealth this conference would never have taken place <e> <s> if it breaks down now i hate to think what the future of the commonwealth will be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i very briefly because many remarks have already been made on this important matter support the noble viscount lord hood and my noble friend lord greenwood in the remarks which they have made and answer one or two of the points which were raised by my noble friend lord shinwell <e> <s> this morning i was at a meeting of sub-committee d of your lordships european select committee and there we had evidence from two united kingdom members of the european parliament <e> <s> they were vehement in supporting any suggestion which would increase the contacts between them and us <e> <s> they believed that it would add enormously to the effectiveness of their work and make them not represent our views they would not as my noble friend lord shinwell suggested take instructions from us but they would find it very much easier to understand what was going on in our minds and they paid us the compliment of saying that because of the work of your lordships select committee we were in a good position to advise them concerning that <e> <s> simply coming once or twice a year in order to give evidence while valuable in itself was no substitute for a much more frequent and informal contact of the sort which could exist if they had certain facilities within the palace of westminster <e> <s> that seems to me to be very strong evidence in favour of taking some positive steps to enable this to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords we must remember that it is only on tuesdays wednesdays and thursdays that these facilities are of any significance and on tuesdays wednesdays and thursdays for at least three weeks in every month the european members of parliament are engaged elsewhere and would never use it there are very few occasions when more than half a dozen of them would be here at the same time and to say that we do not have enough room at our bar to allow those half dozen people to have drinks is either a complete misapprehension of the facts or is suggesting that your lordships are even more alcoholically prone than i think you are <e> <s> the same goes for the facilities in the dining room <e>", "<cs> my lords into the two and a half hours or so that we have devoted to this subject there has been crammed an enormous amount of experience wisdom and knowledge <e> <s> this debate is one that has shown this house at its best <e> <s> we have heard from those who really know at first hand about the countryside commission about the problems of planning about urban blight <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl give us an assurance that there is no question of renegotiating or in any way reducing the amount of sugar at present imported into this country under the acp agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i start off with thanks to the noble lord lord byers for giving us this opportunity to discuss this most important matter <e> <s> i follow with apologies to both the noble lord lord byers and to subsequent speakers that unfortunately owing to a commitment that i entered into long before i knew this debate was to take place i may not be able to remain in the house until the end of the debate <e> <s> i can assure noble lords who will be speaking later that there is no discourtesy on my part <e>", "<cs> my lords i know it is a very special problem but i should have thought it was more consistent with what i understand to be conservative policy to leave this sort of thing to private enterprise and not to have government intervention in order to encourage industry to go where it would not otherwise go <e> <s> but perhaps that is a rather detailed de <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend tempts me to continue with the second part of what i wished to say in my speech but out of deference to your lordships i forebore <e> <s> i would undoubtedly agree with my noble friend that the more that is spent on armaments which are not available for consumption the more inflationary pressure must rise <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house takes note of the reports of the european communities committee on the common agricultural policy eec sugar policy and eec agricultural cost-cutting and price proposals nd report hl <e> <s> th report hl <e> <s> th report hl <e> <s> <e> <s> that my lords is quite a mouthful and it is quite a lot for your lordships to discuss all at one time <e> <s> but clearly all these problems are closely interrelated and i think your lordships will agree that it is more sensible to have one debate embracing all these three reports than to have three separate debates on three separate occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for what he has said <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> it was of some interest i might even say some amusement to me to realise that such disagreements as there were have not been across the floor of the house but rather on one side entirely <e> <s> we have my noble friend lord peart disagreeing with my noble friend lord crowther-hunt we have my noble friend lord davies of leek disagreeing with my noble friend lord sainsbury <e> <s> but across the floor of the house there has been general agreement <e> <s> that shows what an objective approach your lordships have to this enormously important problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it very difficult to speak on this occasion because my instincts are entirely on the side of my noble friends lord brockway and lord hatch <e> <s> i have always been what is described as a hawk over the matter of rhodesia <e> <s> when i was a member of the government i criticised the government from the inside and when i left it and my resignation was not entirely unconnected with my attitude towards their conduct of the rhodesian affair i criticised the then-labour government for taking too soft a view about it <e> <s> i still believe that things would have been better had the hawks had the upper hand in that argument <e> <s> therefore my instinct is to go into the lobby with my two noble friends and others <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord let us know if included in those debts are those which were incurred by the smith regime for arms imports from south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly as one who when a member of the european parliament was a member of the committee of that parliament which dealt with these matters and who has visited lom for discussions of this kind i wish to welcome the order as proposed by the noble lord lord trefgarne <e> <s> we hear so much of the failures and the shortcomings of the community that at times it is good for us to remind ourselves of some of its positive achievements <e> <s> to my mind the original lom concept and particularly the concept of stabex is one of the very real achievements of the eec <e> <s> it is modest far too modest it should go very much farther but <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already made my apologies to my noble friend lord stewart i now make them to the house for my inability to remain here until the end of the debate as unfortunately i have a meeting at which i must be by this evening <e> <s> i have as i think we all must have enormous sympathy for the noble lord lord carrington in his present job as foreign and commonweath secretary <e> <s> it is a job of enormous importance and very great complexity and compared with the job of some of his predecessors such as lord palmerston it is an infinitely more difficult if not a more important task that he has to do <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the first time that i have addressed your lordships on agricultural matters <e> <s> i have never before claimed to speak on behalf of or even with the agreement of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware of the very great feeling of co-operation and reconciliation that exists today in zimbabwe from which i may say i returned only this morning and also of the need to maintain that feeling by ensuring that there are sufficient funds with which to carry out the essential works of rebuilding the economy and <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord explain why if her majestys government are prepared to go to a summit conference if someone else takes the initiative they are not prepared to take the initiative themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords as other speakers have said this has been a good and useful debate and i am crateful to all those who have taken part <e> <s> i am particularly happy that the topic proved sufficiently interesting to tempt my old and noble friend lord boothby to break <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a privilege to be the speaker after a maiden speaker <e> <s> on this occasion it is a very special one because we have listened to a very special speech from somebody who clearly not only knows the countryside and has it close to his heart but has thought deeply about it and has expressed himself in a way which i know has commended itself to all your lordships <e> <s> my only regret at following so closely upon the noble earl is that he has in fact made my speech for me he has said all i intended to say and he has said it very much more cogently and much more briefly <e> <s> but my lords i shall not be deterred <e> <s> i hope he will find that what i have to say at least reinforces and underlines his views <e> <s> i certainly hope that we shall frequently hear him on this and other subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to enter into a detailed technical argument with the noble viscount at this stage and in this place but i should be happy to do so elsewhere <e> <s> in fact that argument is dealt with in the publication which the noble viscount will doubtless read and i hope that he will be convinced that there is very little if any danger of that sort of thing happening other than in the fen country of eastern england where there are no hedges <e> <s> and in any case hedges do precious little good but shelter belts are of enormous importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell and i shall persist in calling him my noble friend in spite of speaking from this bench <e> <s> i am grateful to him not only for giving us an opportunity for discussing this enormously important subject but for introducing it with so much vehemence with such depth of feeling and such depth of knowledge <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is not in his place because i would refute emphatically his suggestion that the noble lord was doing little more than playing a political game <e> <s> i do not want to misquote him but the impression he gave was that we who are the old politicians know this game <e> <s> we sit on one side and we attack the government for not doing the job properly <e> <s> we sit on the other side and defend the government for doing the job properly <e> <s> it is all part of the political game <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by making three introductory remarks <e> <s> first i should like to thank and congratulate the noble lord lord mottistone on the way in which he has introduced his report and the way in which i am told and unfortunately i was not here so it is only secondhand evidence he took the chair during the meetings of sub-committee d secondly i should like to join in the tribute he paid to finn gundelach who was a very fine man and a very fine commissioner <e> <s> he will certainly be missed and his influence will for a long time be felt <e> <s> thirdly i should like to make it clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord chitnis has raised the question of el salvador and what is going on there <e> <s> he indicated that some of the later speakers might widen the debate <e> <s> i should like to attempt to place el salvador in the general picture of latin america and particularly of central america <e> <s> i can best do so by recounting to your lordships three episodes which are vividly in my mind from visits that i have made to that part of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for prolonging this questioning but this is a really important matter and i should like to take the minister up on the last but one answer that he gave to my noble friend lord goronwy-roberts <e> <s> he said that it would be known in a few minutes to the civil service leaders that he would be ready to see them <e> <s> would he not agree if he is really anxious as i am sure he is to discuss this matter with them that rather than let it go out on the tape or by some indirect means it would be more forthcoming and warmer more in keeping with his character to send them a specific invitation will you come this afternoon or tomorrow morning <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not illegal for a british subject to be imprisoned by the republic of south africa in a country which is not in fact south african territory <e> <s> cannot her majestys government take steps to remove this illegality if it is in fact so <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start with an apology <e> <s> unfortunately a long-standing engagement takes me away from your lordships house in a short while and i am not sure that i shall be able to extricate myself from it in time to return for the final stages of this debate <e> <s> in that case i apologise to those noble lords who will be speaking and particularly to the noble lord lord greenhill <e>", "<cs> my lords we are getting towards the end of a long highly interesting and worthwhile debate <e> <s> already a number of things are outstanding in my recollections of this debate <e> <s> first there were the two maiden speeches <e> <s> i will not say more because they have already been referred to by my colleagues on these benches but i should like to repeat that those speeches were magnificent contributions so typical of the two people concerned <e> <s> how fortunate we are to have them in your lordships house <e> <s> the second point that stands out in my mind was the masterly speech made by the noble lord lord ohagan who covered in a remarkably short period of time almost all the salient factors in this debate <e> <s> he was followed by his noble friend the foreign secretary who <e>", "<cs> my lords the power of the labour party conference as i understand it has always been strong and it is growing enormously in strength now and that is one of the reasons for the present difficulties alas <e> <s> within the party <e> <s> i for one could not urge my friends and those who have a vote in the next general election to vote for any party which is committed to taking us out of the common market <e> <s> i believe it is one of the cardinal points of our policy that we must remain in it and that we must fight to improve it <e> <s> of course there are things to improve but to urge people to vote for a party committed to taking us out is something that i am afraid not i am afraid i say quite categorically i could not do <e>", "<cs> i make no apology for detaining your lordships for a little longer and i am glad that there are other noble lords who will be speaking after me because as has already been said this is one of the most important and far-reaching debates that we have had whether it be as a general debate in your lordships house or at committee stage <e> <s> i shall not rehearse the moral arguments <e> <s> we all have the responsibility of making up our own minds as to whether one course of action is more ethical than another though i say quite frankly now that i go along with the right reverend prelates and others who have spoken along that line <e> <s> neither shall i rehearse the arguments which have not been deployed to any very great extent of the sense of history the fact that the government are proposing at the present time to abandon something which has been the pride of this country for many centuries <e>", "<cs> my lords i too apologise for speaking without having put my name down earlier <e> <s> i am moved to do so by a profound sense of sadness <e> <s> this i agree with virtually all the speakers to whom i have listened today is a bad bill albeit that it is not quite so bad as when it first came to this house <e> <s> but it is a bad bill and it is a sad bill for this country <e> <s> i base that statement on four grounds on the grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i should like to thank the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos not only for initiating this debate in such a clear manner but for presiding over the work of the subcommittee keeping us all in order even the most difficult members of the sub-committee and at the same time keeping his temper and enabling us to keep ours <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that is what the noble lord expounded at considerable length with great fluency and persuasiveness earlier on in his speech <e> <s> i was suggesting that the analogies i have given were not all that far-fetched <e> <s> we must ensure that the community is not restrictive in its world trading and the proposals for those who wish to keep out manioc are undoubtedly restrictive they are undoubtedly a blow against the third world and a blow against the general trading with the third world and improvement of conditions within the third world <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all of us in this house have the greatest affection for the noble viscount who has just sat down so we can at least rejoice that the cost of whisky has not increased commensurately with the cost of labour otherwise he would find himself in the very awkward position of having many people whom he would have to sack but not having sufficient whisky with which to get himself drunk <e> <s> so there is at least some bright lining to this sombre cloud <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that owing to some hitch in the arrangements my name was not put down on the list of speakers <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will bear with me if i speak from the benches of the social democrats on this matter <e> <s> as a very old supporter of the whole concept of marketing boards i support this bill <e> <s> the farming industry and the consumers of this country owe a very great debt of gratitude to those two great benefactors of agriculture dr addison and walter elliot for their successful efforts in creating marketing boards <e> <s> alas <e> <s> there are few of them left at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put two questions to the noble lord <e> <s> the first follows the point raised by the noble viscount lord thurso about by-passes <e> <s> clearly it will not be possible to build sufficient by-passes before the regulations come in but will the government be prepared and be able to take steps to prohibit to an increasing extent the heavier lorries from passing through particularly narrow streets of our small towns and villages forcing them perhaps to make rather longer detours in order to preserve the environment and the amenities of these places <e> <s> secondly the statement refers to the saving of million <e> <s> can the minister tell us what is the likely destination of that million <e> <s> will it go to increase the profits of the hauliers or will it be passed on to the ultimate consumer whether in the form of cheaper exports or cheaper prices at home <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that particularly the social anthropological work carried out under the auspices of the sscr is of enormous value to the standing of this country and particularly the academic aspects of this country overseas <e> <s> in view of the answers given and the questions raised by the noble lord lord brockway and particularly in view of the cuts in overseas student grants is it not essential that we do all that we can both on the government side and on other sides to ensure that that work which does so much to promote our good standing overseas is not curtailed <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a useful and a timely report and a useful and a timely debate <e> <s> i am personally most grateful to the noble lord lord hylton for the part he played in the preparation of the report and in allowing us to debate it today <e> <s> there are just four points that i should like to make <e> <s> some of them have already been touched on by other speakers <e> <s> the first is that when cottages in most rural areas and villages today become vacant the usual practice of the owner whether the owner be an individual or a landowner owning several or many cottages is to sell that house because it is empty <e>", "<cs> my lords i would ask your lordships to forget just for a moment the subjects that we have been talking about and envisage a somewhat different scene a scene of an elderly prosperous well-fed well-dressed gentleman sitting in his comfortable and well-heated office <e> <s> he has just finished dictating a letter <e> <s> the letter is to the treasurer of a local charity explaining why he has been compelled to reduce his subscription from guineas a year to guineas the reason being the rising cost of living the burden of taxation and inflation <e> <s> he then leaves his office gets into his rolls-royce and is driven to the savoy hotel where he lunches <e> <s> because of the need for economy he probably has only half a dozen oysters instead of his usual dozen <e> <s> at the end of the meal he smokes a small cigar not a large one and be returns to his office <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to continue on the note on which the noble lord lord john-mackie closed and to thank the noble lord lord mottistone for his introduction of this debate and for his chairmanship of those meetings of sub-committee d which were largely instrumental in producing this report <e> <s> i should like also to thank the chairman of the committee the noble lord lord cledwyn for the part he played in this both in the background and in the foreground and to express my disappointment that he is not taking part in this debate not only as the chairman of sub-committee d but also as a former minister of agriculture and one of the most knowledgeable members of this house in this whole vast important subject <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on these benches are grateful to the minister for repeating the statement a long one and full of many pious hopes with which i do not think many of your lordships if any would disagree <e> <s> one question i should like to put to the minister refers simply to one of those more or less at random <e> <s> the hopes are very good but the implementation is a far more important matter <e> <s> could the noble lord give us any indication as to how it is expected and intended that one of the hopes expressed on central america will in fact be carried out and what initiative her majestys government will be taking <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe we are all agreed or almost all agreed that the course which the government are pursuing at the moment is the correct one <e> <s> i must confess that i have considerable sympathy with the noble lord lord george-brown in some of the things he said although i would have suggested to him had he been in his place that much of this would have been better said and i hope it will be said in the weeks and perhaps the months ahead when in the light of the present situation we can take a very dispassionate and cool look at the whole of our defence posture <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join in the thanks and congratulations to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos for his chairmanship of our sub-committee for the able way in which he has always conducted our investigations and also for his introductory speech this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble baroness for one moment <e> <s> i certainly did not say that the hill farming subsidy could very easily be reduced <e> <s> i know that it would be extremely difficult to reduce it <e> <s> i said that there should be substituted some other form of aid to keep the noble baroness and her friends in the style of life to which they have become accustomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it may seem peculiar that somebody who is probably without boasting one of the largest straw burners in east anglia should support an increase of fine over that which the government propose but i think the national farmers union with whom i frequently disagree also think that it is of enormous importance that the public should come to realise that responsible farmers are just as aware if not more so of the dangers and damage done by indiscriminate straw burning as is the ordinary urban or rural dweller who is not a farmer <e> <s> i think it important the farmers should be made to realise their responsibilities with regard to straw burning <e> <s> these days it has become an essential part of many farming systems <e> <s> we cannot ban it altogether <e> <s> i hope it will never come to that <e> <s> but in order to prevent a universal ban it is necessary that farmers exercise proper control over their burning <e>", "<cs> my lords will her majestys government be prepared to instruct their agricultural attaches in the embassies in athens rome and madrid if they have not already done so to make a special study of this olive oil problem so that her majestys government and particularly the ministry of agriculture are as well informed as possible of all the facts in this complicated matter <e> <s> that will enable them to play a full part in the discussions in brussels <e>", "<cs> my lords it is rash for an east anglian farmer albeit one who has a lifelong interest in the rural scene and in conservation to enter into a discussion which is so very close to the hearts of those living in the north-west of scotland <e> <s> i do so only because towards the end of july i attended a meeting chaired by the noble lord lord craigton where the dangers posed to wildlife by this particular project under discussion were raised <e> <s> it struck me then that a very strong case had been made out for some drastic alteration in the proposals <e> <s> therefore when i was in that part of the world i made a special expedition to lewis and harris in order to find out in a short while what i could about the scheme <e> <s> i was very fortunate in being able to spend a whole day with the man responsible for the project and his assistant and the latter part of the day with a representative of the nature conservancy council <e>", "<cs> may i just finish the quotation my lords <e> <s> it goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have continued and will continue to deal with the point which the noble lord lord melchett has just raised <e> <s> i quoted those two sentences only to show that those responsible for the idp are fully aware of the environmental implications of the scheme and that they are not simply tough agriculturalists interested only in producing more and better grass higher quality silage and better beef and sheep <e> <s> they are people who are aware of the total implications of the environment and of the enormous importance to the other isles of the flora and fauna which exist today <e>", "<cs> my lords may i from these benches add my congratulations to those of other speakers to the government on this very satisfactory outcome to a long and difficult question <e> <s> i have a few specific questions which i should like to put to the noble earl <e> <s> he told us that the total quotas for the united kingdom have been increased in both absolute and proportionate terms <e> <s> can the noble earl tell us what those increases in fact are <e> <s> at the same time could he tell us whether there has been any alteration in the situation with regard to deep sea fishing for cod off the newfoundland coast whether we have any increased allowable catch in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords i was actually asking about access to coastal waters of other community countries <e> <s> i asked whether these were traditional concessions which had been confirmed or whether they were new ones <e> <s> i also asked about deep sea fishing off the newfoundland coast and whether there was any alteration there <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a small but important bill and from these benches i should like to welcome it <e> <s> i should also like to welcome it as one of the beneficiaries of the work of plant breeders <e> <s> the noble lord lord john-mackie pointed out the value of the previous act to plant breeding and the importance of seed breeding to the agricultural community as a whole <e> <s> i would say also to the consumers as a whole because it has enabled us as farmers to keep our costs far below what they would otherwise have been <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord elucidate one point for me <e> <s> he has told us that british telecom have willingly undertaken the obligation in respect of rural telephone boxes and rural remote supplies and he has also told us that there will be benefits from competition which will be of value to the consumer <e> <s> how is it going to be possible for british telecom to compete on an equal footing with other suppliers who are not under the obligations that british telecom are under to provide expensive and unprofitable services <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for his answer <e> <s> he suggested that my few words in introducing this amendment tended not to clarify but obfuscate the situation <e> <s> i shall not return the compliment to him but undoubtedly a considerable amount of clarification is needed <e> <s> the object of this amendment is a simple one to take one example it is to enable the greengrocer to sell a crispin apple known to the housewife as such without giving its more technical japanese name and without committing any criminal offence because it is clear that the apple is for the housewife and her children to eat and then to throw the pips and the core away <e> <s> so long as that can be achieved in that specific case and in other similar cases i shall be completely satisfied <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl and his advisers will be able to figure out a way of convincing us that that can be done <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust the noble earl will not mind if i say that there does not seem to be a great deal of meat in this statement <e> <s> in fact if one could change the metaphor he promises us more jam <e> <s> if that is the right word tomorrow than any decision today <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with others in thanking the noble lord lord oram for allowing this debate to take place <e> <s> it has undoubtedly been useful and in most cases constructive <e> <s> i shall resist the temptation to go into the wider question of aid much as i should like to do so <e> <s> and in contradistinction to the noble lord lord hatch i shall confine myself solely to vso <e> <s> i do so for three reasons <e> <s> the first is that since its inception i have followed its activities with enormous interest and the greatest admiration <e> <s> the second is that with my noble friend lord caradon i share the honour of being one of its two vice-presidents <e> <s> the third and most important reason is the actual volunteers themselves and the work they have been and are doing work that i have seen in a wide range of countries throughout the world <e> <s> whether it be in the eastern caribbean in tanzania or in the solomon islands one comes across these magnificent people mostly but not all young people doing a first-class job and having a real impact on the areas in which they live <e>", "<cs> my lords at lunchtime i had the privilege of listening to the most reverend primate speaking at chatham house and in the course of his fine and thought-provoking remarks he said war is always a failure <e> <s> we have just had a war <e> <s> it was a short one and a successful one but nonetheless it was a war and it marked a failure <e> <s> it is the causes of that failure to which we must now direct our minds <e> <s> that is what the franks report sets out to do and to a very large extent but not to my mind completely it does it in the admirable iucid and objective way which one would expect of the noble lord lord franks and his colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am the next to speak in the debate on the fishing industry i will do no more from these benches than to thank the noble earl for his statement to congratulate him and his colleagues on it and to say how much we welcome it <e> <s> but i shall have further questions which i think will be better dealt with in the actual debate especially as the noble earl will be replying to it <e>", "<cs> my lords after that interesting interlude perhaps we can now return to the main debate <e> <s> it could not have been chosen for a more suitable day and we are fortunate to have the opportunity of discussing this very important matter at rather more leisure and in rather more detail than can normally be done after a statement no matter how important it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to start my speech with a potential apology <e> <s> i have this evening at a meeting that has been long arranged which i have to attend and unless noble lords who are to follow me speak for a long time i might not be able to return in time for the end of the debate <e> <s> i hope that the debate goes on long enough for me to return but if it does not i offer my apologies in particular to the noble lord lord raglan and the noble earl lord ferrers <e> <s> i assure them that i shall read with interest what i say if i am not here to listen to it <e>", "<cs> what they say i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> what one says oneself is always more interesting <e> <s> good sense as well as courtesy demands that i read what they say <e>", "<cs> obviously noble lords are awaiting with anticipation what we have to say about it <e> <s> they will not have to wait for very long but i think that i may say without undue arrogance that i am hopeful that a large part of what i say today will be reflected in the policy of my party in the next few weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister explained that permission to import new zealand butter has been extended for one month and he gave the reasons for that <e> <s> does he expect this monthly deferment of decision to continue for any length of time or does he hope as most of us do that at the next meeting of the council of ministers it will be possible to come to a more permanent arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give us figures showing the numbers of patients in the private sector and the numbers of patients in the public sector who have been able to make use of this form of treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord cledwyn introduced this report with his usual complete mastery of the subject <e> <s> i know i can speak for all his colleagues and my colleagues on sub-committee d when we say how sad we are that he has left us but also how fortunate we are to have as his successor such a distinguished and experienced chairman as the noble lord lord plowden <e> <s> i am quite sure that under his chairmanship the very high standards of reports your lordships have experienced under lord cledwyn will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt <e> <s> is the noble earl telling us that the present level of agricultural prices is so low that it is impossible for farmers to farm properly without other aid and that without that other aid we would be slipping back into the form of agriculture that he has just described <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl but what i hoped i said and what i intended to say was that my impression was that the scheme was being a great success <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene in the debate for two reasons <e> <s> one reason is that many years ago i had the privilege of being a member of the academic council of the centre for a few years <e> <s> i then formed as indeed i had already formed before becoming a member a very high opinion of the centres work and as other noble lords have said that was due very largely to its first director sir heinz koeppler <e> <s> judging from what i have heard its work since then has continued and has altered to some extent with changing circumstances but it still performs a very valuable service <e> <s> i certainly would not argue with the <e>", "<cs> my lords the trouble with speaking late in a debate like this is that there are so many aspects that have been raised by previous speakers that one is tempted to take them up answer them and <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understand the noble lord to say that the government have made no calculation of the cost and can give no figures as to what the cost would be how is it possible to say that the cost will be too much and cannot be afforded <e>", "<cs> my lords not only within this house but also outside it many people will be grateful to the noble earl lord cathcart for having given us an opportunity to discuss this vitally important subject and for having opened this debate in such an admirable way <e> <s> we have a chance to talk about what is an enormously important matter and we also have the chance as has been shown by the speeches to which we have listened already to hear many different points of view <e>", "<cs> my lords may we now return to the somewhat smoother waters of the occupiers liability bill <e> <s> i rise with considerable diffidence to speak on this subject because i can lay no claim to any form of legal expertise certainly not to that of the distinguished legal lights the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and the noble lord lord mishcon who have already spoken nor indeed to that of my noble friend lord foot who will be speaking later <e> <s> i have broadly speaking only two things to say <e> <s> first i would like from these benches to give a welcome to this bill which goes a long way to fulfilling the purposes set out by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in his opening remarks and to express our approval of the aims that he has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who had the privilege and sadness some years ago of visiting nelson mandela on robben island i support the noble lord lord jenkins of putney and urge the government to renew on every occasion and particularly at this present time the efforts that they have already made to secure his release <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord seebohm is a modest man but tonight he has every reason to feel not only pleased but proud about the debate that he has stimulated first by his very thoughtful and well-informed speech and secondly by the successive speakers who have contributed to this debate <e> <s> i share the gratitude of other noble lords who have spoken for the fact that he has given us this opportunity <e> <s> having listened to all the speeches i find it hard and i would not expect in any case to do so to make any original contributions to the debate <e> <s> but it may be helpful if i give your lordships some of the thoughts which have come into my mind while listening to the speeches and pick out those aspects of them which seem to me most important <e>", "<cs> my lords let me be the first from the social democrat benches to congratulate the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon on his maiden speech <e> <s> he is clearly a very fine recruit to your lordhips house <e> <s> he has many qualifications as we have heard and wide experience <e> <s> i know that we shall look forward to hearing him frequently on a wide range of subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill has had a long gestation period starting with consultations between the nfu and the cla and continuing with discussions within the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> at length the gestation has come to an end and the birth has taken place <e> <s> but my lords the birth is a mouse it is no more than that <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead in his most persuasive speech as we expect from him told us that the primary aim of this bill is to arrest the decline of the tenant farmer <e> <s> if that is the primary aim and i accept that it is then i must say quite frankly that it has failed <e> <s> i condemn the bill not because of its commissions for after all there are few commissions in it but because of its omissions <e> <s> this was a wonderful chance that the government had to tackle this very serious problem and i agree entirely with the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> that it is a very serious problem <e> <s> the government have had this chance and they have thrown it away <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> as i understood him he said that the object of the bill was to enable arbitrators to abolish key money in open market rents <e> <s> i do not quite follow how arbitrators come into open market first lettings in any way <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord could expand on that a little <e>", "<cs> we have had a fascinating discussion since i believe that all noble lords who have spoken are agreed in their objectives and all noble lords who have put down amendments want to achieve the same result <e> <s> so we are discussing not what should be achieved but how it should be achieved <e> <s> i would suggest that there are a certain number of factors which we ought to keep in the forefront of our minds <e> <s> first we must realise that there are very few arbitrations <e> <s> virtually every rent review is arrived at by mutual agreement between landlord and tenant or the agents without recourse to arbitration <e> <s> therefore we are talking about a very small number of cases occurring every year <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that the noble lord the minister and the government have got this just about right <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord mackie of benshie that it would be very wrong to base rent upon productive potential <e> <s> in the first place it is a completely unknown factor <e> <s> in the second place as the noble lord lord belstead rightly points out much of an enterprises productive capacity depends on how much capital the tenant has and is prepared to put into his farm whether he is able to put in an irrigation scheme whether he has the money to do so and so on <e>", "<cs> i think that the clause would be better with the amendment <e> <s> the first paragraph of the subsection really covers the matter arid relates to a factor which any experienced valuer or arbitrator would take into account <e> <s> i do not see that the words which it is proposed to delete add anything to the clause <e> <s> possibly they dot the is and cross the ts which i would agree with the noble lord lord northfield we do not want to do too much in the bill <e> <s> we want to leave it to the discretion of the arbitrator bearing in mind the enormously variable circumstances which we all agree exist in different farms and in different areas localities holdings situations and all the other circumstances that we have been discussing <e> <s> so i support the amendment on the grounds that it will slightly strengthen the intention of the bill <e> <s> and it will certainly not in any way detract from what the government are trying to do <e>", "<cs> i would hate the noble lord lord stanley of alderley to take my name in vain and it may surprise him to hear that i agree with him in this matter <e> <s> he has made out a good case and i would reinforce it somewhat by saying that the tenant or the farmer say of a neighbouring farm is always in a <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord for a further clarification <e> <s> arbitration normally takes place when there is a rent review during an existing tenancy after a three-year period <e> <s> if there is disagreement it will go to arbitration <e> <s> would what has happened during the previous three years or six years or nine years fall within the ambit of this clause <e> <s> would that be considered a previous tenancy or is it part of the same tenancy which is continued <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i have it clear in my mind what are the implications <e> <s> but as i understand it and i hope that noble lords will correct me if i am wrong it means that if a farmer is already a tenant of an existing farm for which he is paying rent of perhaps an acre and a neighbouring farm comes up for which he can afford to pay because he already has the equipment and so on then when the rent review for the first farm comes up and it goes to arbitration the arbitrator is not to be allowed to take into account the fact that the farmer has recently tendered for the adjacent farm <e> <s> if my understanding of that is correct then i certainly support this amendment <e> <s> but if perhaps i am wrong one of the noble lords who are proposing it will point that out to me <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i did not make myself clear because i am not suggesting that when the three-year lease of the second farm comes up for renewal it should be reduced because the tenant offered too much but that when the three-year period of his original farm comes up the rent that he offered for the second farm should not be taken into account <e>", "<cs> i have the greatest respect for the noble earl lord caithness but this amendment is completely unacceptable <e> <s> i would use stronger language if it were not for my respect for the noble earl <e>", "<cs> the amendment proposed by the noble viscount has great attractions <e> <s> it is short it is concise it is simple and even for a layman it is relatively easy to understand <e> <s> all those are very strong arguments in its favour especially when compared with the pages through which we have waded this afternoon and this evening <e> <s> but for all that i think that it is an abominable suggestion <e> <s> i think that it will have the most appalling effects upon the landlord-tenant system and upon farming as a whole <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that explanation <e> <s> but if there is recourse to the lands tribunal or whatever it may be some guidance must be given to the lands tribunal as to the basis on which they are to assess a fair rent <e> <s> now is that fair rent going to take into account any of the things we have been discussing here what other people pay what the scarcity value is what the demand is and soon <e> <s> how is it to be assessed <e> <s> before we can pass judgment on this and make up our mind we must be told a great deal more about it than in his concise speech the noble viscount told us <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord john-mackie has spoken with a wealth of personal experience <e> <s> he even makes those of us who are doubtful about it think that there may be something in the hereditary principle after all when he quotes the experience of his great grandfather <e> <s> but what he is in fact saying is that everything lying behind this bill is wrong <e> <s> he is saying that what there was before the three-life tenancy was good <e> <s> he might even have gone on to say that tenancies in perpetuity are better because that is the logic of his argument and where it must inevitably lead <e> <s> i think most of us here have accepted that <e>", "<cs> again i have sympathy with the noble earl in this amendment <e> <s> on the face of it it has a considerable amount of justice and on the face of it it does not have the disadvantage which the previous amendment had of retrospective legislation <e> <s> thinking about it in more detail and somewhat more deeply i am afraid i must oppose it and we on these benches will oppose it on two grounds <e>", "<cs> i certainly support the principle behind the amendment of the noble earl lord kinnoull <e> <s> i think that it is sound and i speak as a geriatric farmer myself who has to all intents and purposes retired from farming <e> <s> it is very important that it shoud be easy for farmers when they reach a certain age and what that certain age should be is very difficult to arrive at if they have security of tenure for their sons to pass it on rather than have to wait till their death <e> <s> it is absolutely essential that that should be done and it would enormously strengthen any legislation such as that which we are now talking about <e>", "<cs> i only want to say that i agree with the noble lord lord northfield that the present act has not worked well in this respect <e> <s> it may have worked well from the point of view of lawyers who have been consulted and who have even brought cases as far as your lordships house but from the point of view of both tenant and landlord it has created a great deal of uncertainty <e> <s> it needs modification <e> <s> on the face of it the proposals put forward in these amendments look as if they should do it <e> <s> i cannot pretend that i am qualified to give them my full approval <e> <s> they obviously need very close study and they need study by those who are expert in these matters <e> <s> but the ideal behind them is correct <e> <s> i hope that the government will accept them in that spirit <e>", "<cs> as it stands i cannot support the amendment of the noble earl lord onslow <e> <s> the noblelord lord northfield was perfectly correct in one of his statements although he did not seem to follow it through in the way i expected his statement that anything of this kind is liable to strike a blow at any of the normal tenancies <e> <s> it can only work if it is very closely hedged in <e>", "<cs> again i find myself in agreement with the noble lord lord northfield <e> <s> i have some sympathy for this amendment but it would be very unfortunate if a good young tenant who started farming in his early twenties and having farmed well found himself at the age of moved out of his farm and unable to get another larger farm <e> <s> it is true that the county councils smallholdings were originally designed as a ladder but if there is nothing at the top of the ladder one should not push the man off when he reaches the top <e> <s> he should be allowed to stay there <e> <s> if it were possible to restrict this power to those cases where the tenant has had the opportunity to get a larger holding but has refused to take it for some reason although i do not see how this can be done that would certainly be most attractive <e>", "<cs> the only thing which modifies my wholehearted support for this amendment is that all voices which have been raised so far have spoken in favour of it and i cannot help feeling that there must be some reason against it <e> <s> but i have overcome that feeling and i seriously give this amendment my wholehearted support <e> <s> farmers have traditionally always had the job of producing food but they have also had the job which they have fulfilled in the main extremely well in the past of preserving and enhancing the environment <e> <s> that is something which they must continue to do <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord one or possibly two questions <e> <s> as i understand it from what he said the object of this exercise is basically to save money to save the salaries of four officials <e> <s> would the noble lord agree with me that it is tantamount or analogous to say that undoubtedly money would be saved if our judges were appointed not by the lord chancellor but by the bar <e> <s> they would be able to do it and they could probably do it cheaper and various public officials could probably be dispensed with <e> <s> but nobody would suggest that that is the right way of doing it <e> <s> we do not want to save money at the expense of having litigants feel that they are not getting a square deal as they do today <e> <s> yet the noble lord is saying to us that in order to save a very small amount of money we should run the risk a risk which has been expressed by people who are very close to both farmers and landowners that those litigants in dispute will feel if the present system of appointing arbitrators is dispensed with that they are not getting a square deal <e>", "<cs> my lords we are coming to the end of this debate and i hope that the noble viscount lord buckmaster is happy about it <e> <s> we certainly owe him very much not only for his introduction of the debate but for the fact that we have been privileged to listen to so many really outstanding speeches <e> <s> also i am delighted that the noble lord lord morris has intervened in the way that he has <e> <s> i am only sorry that he did not say more because the only sad aspect of this <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble earl on two things that he said <e> <s> the first is that there is much to be said for enabling willing tenants and willing landlords to agree to a term of tenancy between them <e> <s> i also agree with his wish not to drive a coach and horses through the present security of tenure but my worry is that as this is drafted it does drive if not a coach and horses at least a fairly substantial victoria or brougham through the present legislation and desired legislation <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord john-mackie for his final words and for what he said earlier <e> <s> however what he did not mention is that when our discussion pamphlet was written he was in favour of land nationalisation and i was against it <e> <s> i think that the noble lord has since somewhat modified his views <e> <s> i have not in this case modified my views <e>", "<cs> it is true <e> <s> many do it and i can give the noble lord examples <e> <s> private investors do the <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord would be right if i were going to be much longer <e> <s> i was simply demolishing to the best of my ability and as briefly as possible the very poor arguments put forward by the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> i hope but without much confidence that the noble lord will think again about this <e> <s> i can however assure him that in spite of the offered support of the noble lord lord john-mackie i shall not divide the house at this stage on this issue <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> there are many curious bedfellows <e> <s> it started off with the rather odd combination of the nfu and the cla and now we find that we have the labour opposition and the conservative benches possibly even the conservative front bench even including the noble lord lord stanley of alderley all in the same bed together and to make it even odder the alliance will see if there is any room for them to get in too <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord expand a little on his definition of temporary <e> <s> he told us that it is not permanent <e> <s> will he give us a slightly narrower definition and say how long in his opinion temporary should be <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a duty it is a genuine pleasure to congratulate and thank the noble lord lord fanshawe of richmond for the speech to which we have just listened <e> <s> i can assure him that even if there were no such convention in this house as that to which he has referred concerning maiden speeches not a single noble lord who was listening to him at the beginning of his speech would have had any temptation or inclination to leave <e> <s> we listened with rapt attention and so far as i am concerned with almost entire approval and agreement with what he has said <e> <s> we are fortunate to have his very great experience both ministerially and in another place to help us in this chamber <e>", "<cs> and i do suggest that it would have been of enormous value to the united states through this whole period if there had been not simply the voice of the united kingdom a little whispering voice if indeed there ever was one but the strong voice representing million people with the whole european tradition behind them friendly towards the united states and sharing all the basic values <e> <s> and if that voice had said to them and were to say to them now what our views are here what we believe is the right attitude to take we cannot impose our will on them of course not as other noble lords have said as a group of european foreign ministers or as the european council speaking with one voice whether it be about southern africa central america the middle east or south-east asia there is the weight and the influence which we should be able to exert <e>", "<cs> my lords it is rash indeed for an east anglian farmer to enter into a debate which has shown itself to be the domain not only of welshmen and welsh women but of those who have as most welshmen and welsh women have the enormous grasp of the problem at issue the deep feeling towards <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i misunderstood the noble and learned lord and i am delighted to be corrected by him because i am sure we all agree that the claim of aberystwyth is not a parochial local or welsh claim but a national and an international claim <e> <s> i will now move on to the second reason why i am intervening in this debate and that is because of the overall importance of agricultural research and i include food research there and the very long-term nature of such research which i know <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is talking of the general matter of financing and where the cuts will fall may i ask whether due account has been taken of the income which accrues to the government through the national seed development organisation as a result of plant royalties and specifically what is coming in from the work already done at aberystwyth in that respect <e> <s> is that credited to each individual institute is it paid back to the afrc or is it simply absorbed into the general maw of ministry expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord has taken the line that he has with regard to the amendment <e> <s> i would suggest that he canot really have it both ways <e> <s> as i understand his argument it is twofold <e> <s> either there is absolutely no difference or there will be no difference between the rent at the time the arbitrator is setting about his work and at the time the tenancy comes to an end and the new rent comes into force <e> <s> that is one argument and the other argument is that it is impossible for an arbitrator to look so far ahead that he is not going to be able to see what the conditions are at that time <e> <s> they seem to me to be mutually contradictory arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened to a very long discourse but i think that it has been of value and it has clarified the matter although it has obscured certain points <e> <s> i should like at the outset to associate myself with those who have expressed thanks to the noble lord lord belstead not only for his courtesy but for the care that he has taken over this bill <e> <s> it is refreshing to find a government minister who is prepared to listen to all the arguments to do his best to take out the best of them and to reject the worst <e> <s> my own opinion is that i dislike the language of his amendment and much prefer the language of amendment no <e> <s> put down by the noble lord lord renton and it is rather surprising that two distinguished lawyers should be able to write such clear and intelligible english <e> <s> although i prefer his method of expression in the case of content i prefer amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord belstead <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is a good amendment and i support it <e> <s> i cannot go along with the proposal of the noble viscount lord dilhorne <e> <s> it perhaps sounds logical but let us look at the situation as it might well arise <e> <s> if the father let us call him or the tenant does not wish voluntarily to surrender the tenancy to his son or next relative for the landlord to impose it upon him against his will would lead to an unhappy family situation which cannot be in the interests of the farm itself <e> <s> i do not think it is in any way practical for that reason <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot support the noble earl <e> <s> i have sympathy with what he is trying to do but i think one uses common sense which should be used perhaps rather more than is the case in matters of bad husbandry <e> <s> husbandry and management so far as the tenant farmer is concerned go hand in hand and cannot be distinguished <e> <s> if you manage badly in my submission you are practising bad husbandry and if you farm badly even though you may technically appear to be managing well you are still practising bad husbandry <e> <s> the law is there it is not being implemented properly i do not know why <e> <s> it may be because landlords do not like to bring cases against tenants it may be because tribunals before whom such cases come have been unduly lenient <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord has not yet sat down because i should like to ask him whether he can explain to me i am sure that i am far more ignorant than other members of your lordships house the precise meaning of the word physiographical in his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble earl lord onslow i am not whole-heartedly in favour of fixed-term tenancies but i do agree with the general principle that after a farmer has reached the age of although there are some exceptions to this in general it is good that he should consider retiring <e> <s> it is good for agriculture it is probably good for him and good for those who come after him <e> <s> i looked with considerable favour on the proposals of the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the members of the holy alliance of conservative labour liberal and sdp peers who have put their names to the amendment i wish very briefly to give vocal support <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord northfield is perfectly right <e> <s> this is a modest proposal for me it is far too modest <e> <s> as the noble lord lord belstead may recall at committee stage i put down an amendment which went considerably further and which unfortunately was rejected out of hand <e> <s> therefore i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to empower harbour masters to give directions to prohibit vessels from entering the areas of jurisdiction of their respective harbour authorities or to require the removal of vessels from those areas where those vessels

compensation for damages suffered in certain circumstances as a consequence of those directions and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords we are as the noble lord lord belstead rightly said grateful to the noble lord lord plowden for giving us the opportuntiy of debating these three reports and also for the masterly way in which he introduced the debate <e> <s> as a member of the sub-committee which produced them may i also thank him for his chairmanship <e> <s> it was a pleasure to sit under him and such value as the reports have is in very large measure due to his work <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that entirely <e> <s> i hope i made it clear that prices are too high and that they should be reduced <e> <s> my point was that one must not rely upon the price mechanism to dispose of all the surpluses <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for detaining your lordships yet longer but i promise not to keep you for very many minutes <e> <s> i intervene for three reasons two of them are purely personal and one general <e> <s> the personal ones are first that i have lived within six miles of the fitzwilliam museum all my life and therefore can claim to have some knowledge of it and certainly enormous respect for it <e> <s> the second is that years ago my father became the second director of that museum and so i have a strong family connection with it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl the minister will allow me may i take up that rather encouraging remark and ask whether the same will apply in respect of glasgow for instance which i understand is facing similar problems <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this is not i say frankly at the outset a bill of profound importance to a great many of your lordships although it is of profound importance to a certain aspect of our maritime life <e> <s> nor i am glad to say is it a long or a complicated bill <e> <s> its purpose is to plug a gap in the powers of harbour authorities to deal with serious emergencies <e> <s> because it is a simple bill i am not proposing i hope that your lordships will not take this amiss to go through the bill in the normal way clause by clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords who have spoken and to the noble lord lord lucas and his officials for the help that they have given in the preparation of this bill <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord lucas has gone quite a long way to answer the questions posed by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> consultations were carried out by the british ports association on a wide basis <e> <s> i am afraid that at this stage i cannot give the noble lord <e> <s> lord underhill an exact list of all the power who have been consulted but i shall happily do so later if he so wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords we have it on the highest authority that there is joy in heaven when a sinner repents and it would be arrogant and indeed churlish if i did not express some joy at a certain evidence of repentance on the part of the minister of agriculture <e> <s> i am sorry however that the repentance has been so long in coming and is so restricted in its form <e> <s> i doubt if those introductory remarks come as any surprise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i too am grateful to the noble lord lord beswick for having given us the chance of discussing this important problem and particularly for having allowed us to widen the sphere <e>", "<cs> i do not quite understand what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> it seems to me that he is saying that parliament will be informed of these criteria in exactly the same way that everybody else will be <e> <s> it will be a fact that they will be graciously told about <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that the most interesting figures he has quoted show that it is perfectly possible to have large-scale closures of mines without industrial trouble provided the general industrial climate is satisfactory but that when you have this confrontation between employer and employee there appears to be a much greater risk of difficulties in bringing about the desired end <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to detain your lordships by speaking on this bill but i cannot resist the temptation to speak on an agricultural bill where i find myself in agreement not only with the noble lord lord john-mackie but also with all noble lords opposite all three of them <e> <s> this is a good bill <e> <s> it is not a big bill but it is a useful one <e> <s> anything which can be done to encourage co-operation of any kind among farmers is good <e> <s> many attempts have been made by many governments <e> <s> none of them has had the success which it deserved <e> <s> if this bill will encourage more co-operation particularly in marketing which is one of the most important aspects it deserves all our support

research which produces the varieties sold by the nsdo <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always held the noble lord lord paget in the highest esteem but i have to say that never in my experience in your lordships house have i listened for minutes to what i can only describe as a farrago of insinuation imagination inaccuracy and distortion <e> <s> the picture that the noble lord purports to give of zimbabwe is one which nobody who has the remotest concern with the country can possible recognise nor indeed anybody who has studied it even in the newspapers <e> <s> i shall move quickly because the time is running out fast <e>", "<cs> my lords first i have the very pleasant though very difficult duty of congratulating my noble friend lord falkland on his maiden speech <e> <s> the reasons why it is pleasant are obvious <e> <s> it was a magnificent speech delivered with delightful informality and with a very great depth not only of knowledge but of feeling <e> <s> it is difficult because other noble lords who have already spoken have taken any words which i might have used out of my mouth <e> <s> this is an indication of the value which this house places upon the speech to which we have just listened <e> <s> in fact the congratulations ought to be directed rather more towards my own party for having acquired such a fine new colleague than towards the noble viscount lord falkland <e> <s> my thanks also are due to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to speak on every amendment which may be of some relief to the committee but i should like to confirm what the noble lord lord lucas has said that although all the amendments except one are in his name they have been discussed with me and all of them are improvements which will clarify the intentions of the bill without in any way altering them <e>", "<cs> if i may refer to amendment no <e> <s> which as the noble lord lord lucas has said is really an alternative to clause it is i think a considerable simplification <e> <s> it is far better to rely on the common law <e> <s> that being so i am fully in support of the deletion of clause as it stands <e>", "<cs> although this may look somewhat portentous on the papers before us really it is nothing more than a redrafting of existing clauses with a view to simplifying them and simplifying the procedures <e> <s> the various amendments to which the noble lord lord lucas has spoken are a considerable improvement and i hope the committee will support them <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can add very much to this discussion which is becoming very technical <e> <s> the point which the noble lord lord underhill has raised seems to me to go rather wide of what this particular bill is proposing to do <e> <s> obviously there may be occasions when a harbour masters instructions even without this bill will be disregarded although i do not think there is any record of that happening just as undoubtedly there are occasions when a policemans instructions to the driver of a car or lorry are disregarded <e> <s> surely the only recourse must be to the law thereafter <e> <s> just as the policeman cannot get into the lorry and drive the lorry away so the harbour master or even the police or the harbour police if there are such people cannot get on board the ship and drive it away <e> <s> it seems to me to be something entirely beyond the scope of this particular bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i start with an apology for not having been here at the opening of the debate and particularly an apology to the noble lord lord brimelow <e> <s> i plead a prior engagement which i can claim had its origins years ago today <e> <s> specifically i was helping in the celebration of the golden wedding of our noble friend lord john-mackie and lady john-mackie <e> <s> i hope your lordships will think that that is sufficient reason for my not having been here at the outset of the debate <e> <s> i shall certainly read the report of it although i would have preferred to listen to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords although i cannot claim to have had the father of the noble viscount as a close friend i was acquainted with him and had a great respect and admiration for him <e> <s> i am quite certain that he would have been indeed proud to have listened to the noble viscount make his maiden speech this evening <e> <s> it is rare indeed to find somebody who has such a close knowledge of the subject of which he is speaking who has the ability to marshall his thoughts in such an orderly and concise manner and on top of that is able to express those thoughts in the manner displayed by the noble viscount <e> <s> we are very fortunate to have him with us and i hope that we shall hear him frequently <e> <s> i should like to think that some at least of his qualities stem from his suffolk agricultural background or even his foreground <e>", "<cs> my lords this somewhat lengthy but never tedious debate has been characterised by the same spirit of restraint and objectivity that one found in the two reports which we are discussing and i join in the gratitude expressed by other noble lords to the two chairmen of those committees and to those responsible for these very valuable and important reports <e> <s> dealing first with the report from the committee on science and technology i have nothing but praise for it and i will not detain your lordships by going through point by point all those aspects with which i agree but would simply pick out two of them <e> <s> i was very happy to see the criticisms contained in the report of the customer-contractor principle particularly as it applied to agriculture and the environment <e> <s> i have never been happy about this principle although i accept that in certain cases it is of value <e> <s> however the report shows how very dangerous it is in matters such as those which we are discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl inform us of whether any of the work formerly done by the civil servants who are now no longer employed is being done by private firms and if so how many people are employed in that work <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be following my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe in particular on his last point because it is about that rather than the third world as he suggested i might that i should like to take up your lordships time for a very few minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to pursue i will not call it a hare but the point raised by the noble lord lord craigton i shall however forbear to do so and i hope we shall have a chance of talking about it in the not-too-distant future <e> <s> i should like to deal if i may with the rather more general problem of pollution however it may be defined <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord for repeating the statement and to the government for their response to the publics demand <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm what i understood him to say namely that british grain exported from british ports to third countries qualifies in exactly the same way as any other british commercial export for ecgd cover where that is available <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to empower harbour masters to give directions to prohibit vessels from entering the areas of jurisdiction of their respective harbour authorities or to require the removal of vessels from those areas where those vessels present a grave and imminent danger to the safety of any person or property or risk of obstruction to navigation to enable the secretary of state to give <e>", "<cs> my lords this house has the reputation of having address us those who are experts in their own subject <e> <s> so far this evening we have certainly lived up to that reputation <e> <s> we have listened to a remarkable speech from the noble lord lord chitnis which was full of objective information and full of his very wide experience in those parts <e> <s> it is hard not to be impressed by what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness i am grateful to her for giving way whether in the governments opinion the conditions prior to the actual voting were less favourable for free and fair elections than they were in el salvador <e>", "<cs> my lords we are doubly in the debt of the noble lord lord sherfield first for enabling your lordships to discuss this vitally important subject and to listen in the course of the debate to many distinguished scientists and others with great experience on these matters and secondly for the masterly way in which he has introduced the subject running briefly but fully through the earlier history of scientific research in this country then bringing us to the present situation and finally making some pertinent suggestions for improving the situation <e> <s> i am sure that i am only expressing the views of all your lordships in thanking the noble lord for what he has done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to be corrected by my noble friend and i hope that they will make it very clear to us that they at least so far as their own industries are concerned are doing all that is necessary to promote industrial research in their particular field <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i have two interests to declare <e> <s> the first is as a farmer and a substantial user of sprays the second is as a director of a company manufacturing such sprays for use throughout the united kingdom <e> <s> i hope that in spite of that your lordships will acquit me of any undue bias in those things which i have to say <e>", "<cs> all noble lords who have spoken so far are in favour of this amendment in principle and i am also <e> <s> i should like to put one further point which has not been mentioned here <e> <s> it is quite conceivable that there is a suspected emission of something toxic in an area <e> <s> the authorities perfectly correctly put a stop order or whatever it would be called on the utilisation of crops in that area for human consumption <e>", "<cs> in general i support the noble lord lord belstead on this <e> <s> i think it is very important that there should be adequate enforcement <e> <s> there is a shortage of suitable people for doing this <e> <s> those who are charged with the job of enforcing our fisheries legislation are few and extremely efficient and it seems to me that they are suitable people to add to this very small enforcement body <e> <s> i cannot see any useful reason why they should be excluded from adding to their work in this way <e>", "<cs> i wish to add a brief word in support of the principle behind this amendment <e> <s> it seems a simple one and on these benches we certainly feel that fish farming should be taken note of and should be subject to the same protection and enforcement as other forms of aquatic activities <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with the noble lord lord melchett and rather more sympathy with the noble lord lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> this is surely a question of balance <e> <s> i think it would be wrong for farmers to be able at will and without any warning to spray dangerous chemicals over a footpath but i think it is impractical to follow the suggestion put forward in the amendment of the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> would it not be possible for a list to be prepared by the ministry of agriculture of those sprays which are potentially dangerous to human beings or animals on contact and then to lay it down that when such chemicals are used on a field or an orchard adjacent to a footpath the farmer should be obliged to put up a notice at each end of the footpath saying that he has sprayed these chemicals on such-and-such a date <e> <s> the farmer should leave the notice up for however long it may be that the chemical has an adverse effect on passers-by <e>", "<cs> this has been a worthwhile short exchange of views and i am most grateful to the minister for what he has said and for his undertaking to give thought to these problems <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in principle i support what my noble friend lord mackie of benshie and what the noble lord lord john-mackie have said <e> <s> as farmers i think that in almost every case we can manage without aerial spraying although i accept that there are certain occasions when that is both desirable and sometimes even necessary <e> <s> forestry and hillside bracken spraying is an entirely different category and there the regulations should clearly be far less stringent than those needed for proper agricultural spraying <e>", "<cs> as i understand it there is agreement with the operators of aerial spraying to increase from feet to feet the minimum proximity distance from residential buildings <e> <s> could the noble lord tell us whether this is statutorily binding or a voluntary agreement and whether he considers that the feet is adequate or whether he would rather see it extended to something like perhaps yards <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord to clarify this <e> <s> he says that the consultations would be between the health and safety executive and the caa <e> <s> the noble lord did not mention the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> does he take it for granted that the ministry of agriculture will be included in those consultations or will it be left solely to the two bodies he mentioned <e>", "<cs> i have one further question <e> <s> as i understand this amendment it says very clearly that products may be submitted for approval within a period of two years <e> <s> that does not mean to say that the ministry must grant approval or otherwise within a period of two years but that the manufacturer must submit the product within that time and then it is up to the ministry to deal with the matter as quickly as it reasonably can <e>", "<cs> i would certainly support anything that moves towards freedom of information <e> <s> that is a valuable step to take <e> <s> i should like to take up the final point of the noble earl lord onslow <e> <s> it is something that we must look at carefully <e> <s> our own manufacturers are guarded by patent law in this country and in many other countries but not in all countries throughout the world <e> <s> while this informa <e>", "<cs> i am quite sure that the noble lord is not trying to be obstructive indeed he is being most helpful <e> <s> if as he suggests these matters are covered already by other legislation dealing with veterinary practices then i would agree with him that there is no reason for this amendment <e> <s> but if on further examination it appears that this is not the case it will always be possible to come back <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to the noble baroness for repeating the answer to the private notice question which was asked in another place by my right honourable friend the leader of the sdp <e> <s> i am also grateful for the indication of the governments further aid <e> <s> it is certainly encouraging that the government have reacted quickly to this <e> <s> but would the noble baroness not agree that it would be far better if we in this country other governments and the eec could be informed in good time of these things happening rather than having to rely as we so often do on information provided by journalists valuable though that is in stirring up public opinion in favour of aid <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness one question <e> <s> can she give us any indication of how long it will be before the million which has now been made available by her majestys government will actually be translated into grain arriving in the refugee camps in the sudan <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord underhill and lord brabazon of tara for their approval of this bill and their good wishes and for the brevity with which they have expressed that <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the bill be read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will accept the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me an eminently just one <e> <s> i do not think that it is unreasonable to take an example which admittedly is not likely to arise very frequently <e> <s> there might be a grower of strawberries some readily perishable crop who is close to a factory where there has been a suspected emission or leakage of some toxic chemical <e> <s> it would be absolutely right for the ministry of agriculture at that stage to prohibit for a few days the picking of any more strawberries because they might be contaminated <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will give way for a moment i should like to make a point <e> <s> i agree entirely that the polluter should be responsible <e> <s> the example i gave the hypothetical example was where in fact there was found to be no polluter there was no pollution <e> <s> the authorities had reasonable grounds for thinking that there might have been pollution but in this case there was none <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first read this amendment i was impelled to say to my noble friend that i could not support it <e> <s> having listened to him speak his intention so far as i am concerned is a desirable one but i have doubts as to whether the amendment as it reads now actually goes along with his intention <e> <s> presumably he means that they must <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord the minister very much for this amendment and for his generosity in giving such credit as there may be for it to some of the views expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords during the second reading of the bill i suggested that aerial spraying might be one of the activities that could be entirely banned <e> <s> since then i have come to realise that that would not be right <e> <s> as several of your lordships have pointed out there are undoubtedly areas such as bracken infested hillsides where aerial spraying is the only means of controlling weeds or improving grasslands <e> <s> there are other aspects such as certain types of potato spraying where it is probably the only and certainly the most efficacious means <e> <s> but i go along entirely with the views expressed by the noble lord lord melchett and my noble friend lord mackie of benshie that aerial spraying can and should be controlled pretty drastically <e>", "<cs> my lords i support these two amendments and also the third amendment although it may not be entirely necessary <e> <s> i accept that this is a fearfully complicated problem <e> <s> on the one hand we all of us i am sure certainly i do wish to see an extension of freedom of information to enable those who are interested to satisfy themselves that nothing is being hidden that there is no dirty business going on underneath the carpet <e> <s> on the other hand following on that particular train of thought i should like to express my own personal complete confidence in those distinguished scientists who are concerned with a lot of this work the advisory committee on pesticides and the scientific subcommittee <e> <s> i hope that those who do this work and do it admirably will not feel that any concession that is made to freedom of information is in any way casting doubts upon their own personal integrity or scientific ability <e> <s> i think that that should be made very clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord brabazon of tara for both these amendments <e> <s> as he said they are minor ones <e> <s> they do not in any way alter the substance of the bill <e> <s> they simply clarify one or two points and correct one minor inaccuracy which was in the original bill <e> <s> i am sure that the bill will be improved if your lordships committee accept both amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords there may be some holes in this amendment but i cannot go along with the argument of the noble earl lord onslow in this respect <e> <s> i think we have all agreed particularly having listened to the various debates we have had on this general subject that agricultural sprays are potentially toxic substances <e> <s> they are dangerous to wild life they are dangerous to plants and they are dangerous to human beings <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord melchett is very persuasive but i am afraid that he has not persuaded me and i hope he will not persuade your lordships <e> <s> the intention is of course admirable <e> <s> but as i understand it it could mean that a chemical of great value to food production which is illegally used to destroy some golden eagles could on the advice of the nature conservancy council the health and safety executive the department of health and social security or the department of the environment but significantly not the ministry of agriculture be denied for the use of food production <e> <s> that does not seem to me to be the right way to set about it any more than i would consider it to be right to abolish the use of alcohol because in certain cases it has been misused by a minority of its consumers <e> <s> therefore i hope the government will not see fit to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the emphasis which is now being placed on the movement of agriculture from solely food production to the general realm of environmental protection can the minister assure us that this move will not be jeopardised in any way as a result of the curtailment of the soil survey financing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to take this opportunity to develop an indictment of the government for having made this bill necessary at all <e> <s> i would indict them on grounds of short-sightedness of having failed to foresee the situation many years ago when it was clear to any of us who studied the matter that this was going to happen and that drastic steps had to be taken of having agreed with the commission to the introduction of a barely thought-out scheme leading to many anomalies many difficulties and great hardship <e> <s> in addition to that i indict them for pinning their faith as i know they have done and i gather they still do to the theoretical idea that the way to control surpluses in farming is purely by the price mechanism and only when that fails does one have to resort to something of this sort <e>", "<cs> my lords of course governments of both complexions realised this <e> <s> my complaint is twofold that they were not sufficiently forceful to be able to carry their colleagues with them and that they were not sufficiently thoughtful to put forward practical systems for quota restrictions many years ago three four or five years even before the noble lord and his friends were there so that this situation could never have arisen <e> <s> my fear is that they are following the same ineffectual path with other commodities <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one short question about the payment which is being made to the farmers <e> <s> what happens if a farmer dies during the intervening period <e> <s> will payment cease because it is personal to him or will it be part of his estate and continue to be paid to whoever succeeds <e>", "<cs> my lords i am as i am sure are all of your lordships who are still here most grateful to the noble lord lord thomas of swynnerton for giving us the chance to discuss this very important subject <e> <s> we are also grateful for his introduction of it <e> <s> i should like to have the time and temerity to disagree with him on some of his professorial pronouncements of a historical kind <e> <s> i shall not attempt to do that but i am in agreement with a great deal of what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches may i very briefly add our support for these two draft orders <e> <s> they are not of enormous significance in themselves <e> <s> they certainly do not involve this country in any awkward obligations <e> <s> but i should like also to underline the point raised by the noble lord lord boston concerning the entitlement to health services of those who otherwise would be entitled to them but who are not british nationals <e> <s> that i believe to be an important minor point <e> <s> apart from that i should like to support any activities of the kind to which these draft orders apply <e> <s> although we are not altogether happy particularly at the present time with some of the meteorological forecasting which we listen to it cannot be the full fault of the forecasters <e> <s> i wish they had recently been more often wrong than right but they have been remarkably and uncomfortably accurate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble baroness and ask for clarification of this point <e> <s> the minister tells us that in this matter the official would still be subject to the laws and regulations of his own country <e> <s> does that mean that if his country had reciprocal arrangements with the united kingdom he would still be entitled to those facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that every member of your lordships house and i believe everybody who lives in this country wants to see a prosperous countryside <e> <s> we do not want to see deserted villages empty schools or derelict churches <e> <s> however many people consider that this can be achieved only by a prosperous agriculture <e> <s> if that were so it would be a poor lookout for the countryside as a whole because the choices facing agriculture are simple and clear if we are to maintain the standard of living of those who are engaged in food production <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment but i share the reservations of the noble lord lord melchett that it does not go far enough that it is almost too gentle in its phraseology <e> <s> i hope that that may be overcome by the minister when he replies because when as i hope he will he accepts this amendment i hope that he will spell out very clearly that he agrees with those who have already spoken on what is implied in this amendment as to the three criteria which must be observed in this body which is to be created to look after these rural spaces <e>", "<cs> my lords time was many years ago when a messenger returning from a foreign country with bad news paid for his unwelcome news with his life <e> <s> i am glad that we have now moved on from that time because i should hate to see the noble lord or even his right honourable friend paying for this abysmal failure with their lives <e> <s> it really is one of the most depressing statements that we have had ever since i can remember these statements being made and as is so often the case it is masked with a veneer of pleasure and self-satisfaction <e>", "<cs> nothing like it has been achieved my lords and there is now a question mark over what is going to happen <e> <s> i will underline what was said by the noble lord lord john mackie <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord will agree that all the brief comments i have made have taken the form of questions to the minister which i hope he will be able to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating the answer given to my honourable alliance friend in another place <e> <s> i should also like to thank her for telling the house of the arrangements already made and in the course of being made by the government to deal with the beginnings of the problems in the sudan <e> <s> it is clear from this that at least in theory the government will not be caught short as was the case with ethiopia last year <e> <s> warnings are being heeded <e> <s> i am particularly happy that the government are consulting with the voluntary aid agencies whose knowledge of these situations and of the countries in which they take place in unrivalled <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness understood me as asking about the light aircraft <e> <s> my question was about chartering a vessel which i understood the noble baroness to say had taken place <e> <s> according to my rapid calculations this would carry between and tonnes of grain <e> <s> my question was is that all that is being done or is more similar chartering of vessels in mind <e>", "<cs> i cannot support the amendment of the noble lord lord burton but i have a great deal of sympathy for him and for his crofters <e> <s> i cannot help feeling that a word from the appropriate minister to the appropriate officials in the relevant areas could overcome this difficulty <e> <s> what we have heard is a story of a lack of personal liaison between the people who are actually involved in this very difficult question of holding the balance between the livelihood of crofters which is not a very fat livelihood at any time and the preservation of a particular species of bird which is extremely rare and has been in danger of extinction <e> <s> it can be overcome only by the proper kind of personal contact and understanding <e>", "<cs> i was not for a moment suggesting that any of the ncc staff should bend the law or that the law should be bent in any way <e> <s> i was suggesting that there should be some pressure to get a better relationship between the officials concerned and the crofters themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement that the noble baroness has made mentions that there are not enough trucks <e> <s> does she agree that in addition to trucks there is a need for spare parts for trucks that spare parts are of no use unless there are qualified and experienced mechanics to fit the spare parts that in order to have such mechanics it is necessary that people should have some training and above all that they should be literate and that for the trucks it is necessary that there should be roads along which they <e>", "<cs> my lords this is for me a sad occasion <e> <s> it is sad because it is the last time that i shall address your lordships as a member of sub-committee d having been a member of it with a two-year break while i was in the european parliament since its inception years ago and having served as chairman for three years <e> <s> but it is also sad for a far more serious reason and that is because this is the first time that i find myself in very fundamental disagreement with the findings of the committee and with the report <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord assure me that i heard him right or correct me if i heard him wrong <e> <s> as i understood him in an earlier answer he said that the government have no power to prevent unauthorised work from proceeding in the national park or its neighbourhood <e> <s> is that what he said <e> <s> if so and that is the position does he not think something should be done to put that right <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the very serious effects that his answer to the question of the noble lord lord john-mackie will have on those who are at present engaged in plant breeding <e> <s> is he also aware of the already falling morale in agricultural research centres throughout the country as a result of the governments attitude toward their activities <e> <s> is he further aware of the impossibility of extricating the basic research which is essential for plant breeding and many other forms of research from the more applied research which is presumably what the government have in mind when they talk of privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to prohibit the discharge from vessels of oil or mixtures containing oil into certain united kingdom waters and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset may i declare an interest in the cdc however remote having been closely associated with the organisation until some three years ago and still retaining a very great admiration and affection for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the statement and perhaps somewhat to his surprise congratulate him upon it <e> <s> in spite of the complaints to which the noble lord lord john-mackie referred i think the department has acted relatively quickly in what is a very complex matter <e> <s> while it would be nice to see the help spread to others who undoubtedly have suffered very much particularly the arable farmers in certain parts of scotland and in the north of england i accept the fact that government finance is limited <e> <s> what is more at the risk of making myself unpopular with my farming friends i would say that the weather is one of the hazards that farmers have to take into account themselves <e> <s> they cannot always look to the government to help them out <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard has said many interesting things some of which i agree with and others i do not <e> <s> however i must say i was surprised at his final remark <e> <s> from what i know of the noble viscount i should have thought on the whole that he would consider that something which was years old was better than something modern <e> <s> i was surprised when he voiced that accolade for modernity <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl my lords <e> <s> in other words there are about centres for every inspector which means given the fact that the inspector sometimes takes a holiday one week for each centre if he is to visit them once a year <e> <s> it is a pretty heavy workload when you consider the amount of work that an inspector has to do in order to do his job properly as he does <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his intervention which emphasises the point that the inspectors have a very heavy workload <e> <s> we must remember that they do not spend the whole of their time going round from one centre to another and from one laboratory to another <e> <s>

person who used to be called the resident commissioner <e> <s> i am not sure what his present title is or whether he is called the high commissioner in lesotho but presumably we have access on a diplomatic basis through our embassy in pretoria to him <e> <s> have the government considered making use of those privileges to ensure that at least the diplomatic staff in lesotho are taken care of with possibly some surplus to take care of other priority cases such as hospitals and the provision of medical care <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord consider that the government are at the

beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord consider using his undoubted powers of persuasion to suggest to the post office that in view of the fact that it would have far less expense in selling stamps in bulk to other retailers it should offer some discount so as to encourage them <e>", "<cs> my lords given the very great contribution that both the pbi and the nsdo have made to agriculture in this country and the high esteem in which they are held in other countries too and the fact that their financial record is most satisfactory and they bring in considerable sums of money to the exchequer will not the noble earl give us very briefly the governments reasons for even considering the privatisation of these two organisations if only in part <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the gratitude of other noble lords who have spoken both for the work of the two sub-committees and also for the very clear way in which their reports have been presented by their respective chairmen <e> <s> one would expect nothing less and i must say to the noble earl lord ferrers that i for one am delighted that he is not at the mansion house <e> <s> if i may say so he has made the best speech i have ever heard from him certainly far better than

extremely well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister two questions <e> <s> i am confused about the saving of million ecus <e> <s> is it a saving over last years <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord belstead may be surprised to hear me say that i greet this bill with praise albeit with faint praise <e> <s> he told us that its object is to develop a partnership between government and farmers a very desirable objective <e> <s> i cannot honestly see it developing any greater or better partnership than there is at the present time <e> <s> i shall not go into details but while i agree with clauses to on the home-grown cereals authority i cannot see that altering the membership from a minimum of and a maximum of to a minimum of and a maximum of will do a great deal to develop a partnership between government and farmers <e> <s> also i cannot see that altering the number of people on the meat and livestock commission from a maximum of to a maximum of will do that

that scottish farmers are so much better at taking advice and following it that they need it much less now than we do in our part of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord for a moment just to clarify this rather important point <e> <s> am i right in thinking particularly from his last sentence that in designated areas grant will still be available as it has been in the past but will be withheld if in the opinion of the ministry it is detrimental to the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord simon i am speaking as an individual and not on behalf of my party <e> <s> i should like to make it clear that my noble friend and i have not put our heads together to evolve a common approach yet in spite of that which is perhaps one reason why the alliance is strong i find myself in complete agreement with all that he said <e> <s> we have been fortunate this evening not only in having an admirable introductory speech by the noble lord lord hatch but also in being able to listen to the right reverend prelate with his wide knowledge and his personal experience of namibia and to the noble lord lord caradon whose knowledge of both the

forgive me if i do no more than thank her very briefly for giving us the opportunity of discussing this enormously important subject and congratulate her on the admirable way in which she opened our discussion <e> <s> i hope that she and other noble lords will forgive me if i do not remain until the end of the debate <e> <s> unfortunately i did not realise perhaps i should say i miscalculated the length of time the two statements would take <e> <s> i have an appointment at eight oclock for which i shall undoubtedly be late but i do not know whether i can make myself late enough in order to stay until the end of the debate <e> <s> i offer my apologies should it transpire that i have to leave <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the general principle of these amendments <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord stanley of alderley was absolutely right in what he said about the importance of maintaining morale in adas or rather re-establishing it as one unfortunately has to say and about ensuring that there is a long-term future for that invaluable organisation <e> <s> there can be no question but that the people who are at present engaged in giving this service not only to farmers but to agriculture and the rural community as a whole are suffering very much from a feeling of uncertainty as to their future <e> <s> i accept entirely that the present government intend to maintain adas <e> <s> i hope that we can have an assurance that they will maintain adas at least in its present form which has been considerably attenuated over the past years <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i go along with all that the noble lord has said but in the earlier part of his speech he said that clause lays a firm commitment on the minister <e> <s> i find it hard to reconcile a firm commitment with the words as printed the minister may make that does not seem to me to be a firm commitment <e> <s> it seems that he <e>", "<cs> the minister has asked a specific question <e> <s> he has told us how he proposes to draw the dividing line between the sort of advice which is paid for and the sort of advice which is not <e> <s> the noble lord has asked those of us who disagree with him if we will give him some answer as to a different form of dividing line <e> <s> my answer would be as i said on second reading as the noble lord may remember that in principle i am entirely in favour of the farmers paying for advice which will increase their profit but not paying for advice which improves the environment <e> <s> after considering this and listening to the noble lord very carefully my opinion is that it is impossible to <e>", "<cs> all i wish to do from these benches is to give our support and my personal support to this amendment <e> <s> the principle as the noble earl lord onslow has pointed out is established in clause <e>", "<cs> i put my name in support of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord middleton not because i thought it was the final answer to this complicated question but because it gives the committee an opportunity to discuss still further something which is of great importance <e> <s> i put my name to the amendment also because it appeared to me to be a great improvement i admit that that is faint praise on the wording of the bill as it was presented to us on second reading when as the noble lord lord middleton rightly reminded us not one noble lord other than the minister spoke in favour of the clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may put the noble lord right <e> <s> i said that if there were no arguments in favour of one side or the other there should be a division <e> <s> however if for instance as in this case the tenant could come up with strong arguments showing how much he had increased the quota then that should be taken into account by the valuer <e>", "<cs> very briefly i should like to go along with what the noble lord lord stodart has said <e> <s> i felt rather sad that the last amendment was not treated as a probing amendment which would have given a chance for more discussion later though it is still not too late for that to happen <e> <s> i hope that the move toward simplicity that is embodied in the amendment can be discussed before report stage and that some of the difficulties can be overcome <e> <s> i agree with what my noble friend lord mackie of benshie has just said <e>", "<cs> it was very refreshing to hear both the minister and my noble friend lord mackie of benshie use the words just and justice <e> <s> i think it is the first time that they have been used in our discussion <e> <s> however what is confusing matters is this <e> <s> so far as i know the government have not defined what they consider to be a just division of the value of the quota as between landlord and tenant <e> <s> i think they agree that any quota in excess of a certain amount per standard quota belongs mainly if not entirely to the tenant because he has been responsible for creating it <e> <s> however we have not heard from the government what they think is a just division of the standard quota if we may use that term i think that we now understand what it means between landlord and tenant <e> <s> possibly they consider that it should all belong to the landlord i do not know <e> <s> it would be helpful if the minister could make that clear to us <e>", "<cs> may i pursue this for a moment in order to clarify the position <e> <s> it is a very important point <e> <s> as i understand it the governments position is that the tenant is entitled to no proportion whatsoever of the standard quota other than that to which he has contributed by his own activities as a tenant over a certain number of years <e> <s> if he has contributed nothing if he has taken over a well-equipped farm with all the right buildings with good grassland capable of carrying milking cows and he continues to carry milking cows and continues to farm adequately so that the grassland is kept up to standard but not improved he is entitled to nothing <e> <s> but he is entitled to that which by his own actions has increased the quota <e> <s> have i understood the minister correctly <e>", "<cs> as the son of an archaeologist the father of an archaeologist and the uncle of an archaeologist i have perhaps some interest to declare <e> <s> i support the amendment most strongly <e> <s> this is a matter of very great value and importance not so much at the present time but for many years <e> <s> farmers in complete ignorance have very often destroyed places which have potential archaeological interest <e> <s> this matter has been far too much ignored in the past and it would be extremely valuable if this modest addition to the clause were made <e> <s> what is more i think this amendment is completely uncontroversial and i hope that the noble lord lord belstead will accept it with both arms <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that a large number of farmers wives particularly in hill areas help their husbands with lambing and precious few if any know of the risk will the government do all that they can in addition to what the noble baroness has already told us to make quite certain that in the first place the risk is well known to all those women who are likely to be involved with <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should like to express my thanks to the noble lord lord ardwick for giving us the opportunity to have this extremely well-informed and highly interesting debate <e> <s> he has given an example of how to protect his environment by placing himself originally between two noble baronesses and behind yet another one so his environment has been well protected and it is good that he gives us that example <e>", "<cs> i cannot allow all the support for the amendment of the noble baroness to come from the other side of the committee so perhaps somewhat unaccustomedly i shall join noble lords opposite in urging the government to accept both these amendments <e> <s> they are good in themselves because it is important that the new provisions should be watched carefully to see how they in fact work out <e> <s> but there is also an additional advantage in that esas will undoubtedly we hope rapidly be increased and there will be larger areas <e> <s> valuable lessons can be <e>", "<cs> at the risk of exhibiting my ignorance i should like to ask two questions first what is the situation of a farmer in an esa who wishes to undertake some personal drainage <e> <s> i am not referring to a drainage authority <e> <s> i am referring to a farmer who simply wishes to drain a damp corner of a field or even a meadow which has some significance or which may eventually be classified as having some significance <e> <s> is he at present free to drain land in an esa if he so wishes <e>", "<cs> in spite of the comments that have been made about the speech of the noble lord lord melchett which i share to some extent he has made out his case <e> <s> he has brought to our attention abuses of which we have heard rumours both by word of mouth and in the newspapers which have now been substantiated <e> <s> these are abuses on a very substantial scale <e> <s> i do not think anybody who has listened to him or who has read the report which i have not can have any doubt that this has gone too far <e> <s> if one were charitable one could say it was a valiant attempt that has failed <e>", "<cs> fortunately people are getting more and more concerned with the appearance of the countryside as a whole <e> <s> the noble earl lord onslow has pointed out that we became concerned about houses and have the various schedulings of houses <e> <s> it is very valuable and important that we should have those <e> <s> we are now getting increasingly concerned not simply about sssis and the preservation of habitat flora and fauna but the appearance of the countryside <e> <s> i think that in general while the countryside is well maintained and very often improved by those who are responsible for it there are occasions when it is not <e> <s> there are acts of vandalism which take place from time to time <e> <s> i think that this amendment makes provision without being unduly bureaucratic or unduly inhibiting to stop this kind of thing happening <e> <s> i therefore support it in principle <e> <s> so far as i can see it is good though it may be that there are ways in which it can be improved <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all of us would agree at least with the opening words of the second paragraph of this consultative document in which as your lordships will know it is stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i must have misunderstood my noble friend <e> <s> the suggestion made by the noble lord lord swinfen is one which deserves great consideration <e> <s> there must be discussions among all the interested parties <e> <s> this document produced getting on for two years ago invites comments and proposals to be sent in no later than th february <e> <s> if it is true that the department did not consult trinity house until the last few days that surely is a grave error both tactically and from the practical point of view <e> <s> i hope that the more recent discussions which have been going on with trinity house will be pursued urgently <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not have said that that was the reason <e> <s> i am not an expert in these matters <e> <s> i cannot say precisely or with any authority what the main reasons are <e> <s> i would suggest to the noble lord that one reason at least is not that we have too many ports but that we have too many pilots <e> <s> we have roughly speaking pilots at present <e> <s> the estimates that i have received they may be disputed but they are i think fairly reliable suggest that there are about to surplus pilots <e> <s> in other words there are per cent <e> <s> more pilots than are needed to carry out the job <e> <s> that is i think <e>", "<cs> my lords as somebody who queried the wisdom of the original powers which were in the bill may i say that i too am extremely pleased that this amendment was made in another place <e> <s> think it improves the bill a bill which is in any case useful in its own right <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble baroness aware that east anglia is the fastest growing region in the whole of the country and therefore the need for planning and knowledge of planning in all its aspects is even more important there possibly more important than even in the north-east <e>", "<cs> my lords i endorse entirely what the noble lord lord john-mackie has said about adas and about both its value and its morale <e> <s> there can be no doubt at all among those who are close to it or are involved in any way in farming that the morale in adas at present is low and is in danger of going still lower <e> <s> that does not in any way mean that the work it is doing is not just as valuable as ever <e> <s> in some ways it is even more valuable <e> <s> all the more credit is due to a group for carrying on in this way although numbers as the noble lord will know have declined severely <e>", "<cs> my lords it is many years since the ministry of agriculture enlarged its sphere to become the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> despite the passage of time we must admit that most of us not just those of us who are farmers look at it as the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> we may occasionally call it maff but usually we call it the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> whatever it is called it is regarded by the public as the department of state which looks after food production and farmers interests <e> <s> some farmers may disagree with that but that is the general opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very strongly to support the amendment <e> <s> those of your lordships who have allowed your eyes to wander ahead will see that there is another amendment amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord stodart my noble friend lord mackie of benshie and myself <e> <s> the two amendments are in their effect identical and in their intention identical <e> <s> it is purely a question of which one is the more effective but the principle is the same and it is to the principle that i shall confine myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the third reading of any bill is the time to rehash all the arguments that have taken place during the committee stage and on report <e> <s> i shall not attempt to do that and i am sure your lordships would not think well of it if any noble lord were to do such a thing <e>", "<cs> my lords much of what the noble lord lord hatch of lusby said tempts me to enter into arguments with him but i agree with a certain amount of what he said <e> <s> i shall restrict myself to one point <e> <s> i share with him a worry that our manufacturers are not looking sufficiently to distant countries in particular the third world for their markets and have concentrated too much on europe important though that market is <e> <s> i cannot for the life of me see how the bill in any way affects that problem <e> <s> i hope that it will be overcome by the manufacturers themselves <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will agree with me that it will not be exacerbated in any way by the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords most people already know the answer to that question <e> <s> i shall not be led astray into discussing the falklands campaign or the part played by the european community although it did give us a certain amount of assistance in agreeing to sanctions against the argentine <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with the first comments of the noble baroness congratulating the noble lord and continue by congratulating him on the actual content of his answer <e> <s> as a cambridgeshire farmer may i disagree strongly with the noble baroness concerning the impact of straw-burning in that county this year <e> <s> i ask the noble lord whether he agrees that the amount of straw burnt both statistically and from casual observation has turned out to be very much less than in previous years <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall ask your lordships for a few minutes to stop thinking about all the pressing problems that confront us today and instead to look at how our foreign policy is formulated because todays problems which were referred to in the gracious speech and by all noble lords who have spoken and which will be referred to by those who are yet to speak stem to a very large degree from the actions and the inactions of five or years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord brabazon for his very clear exposition of the bill <e> <s> at the same time to set at rest any doubts that he may be having i may say that we on these benches support the general principles of the bill and look on it as an improvement in what he himself described as the present cumbersome system of organising pilotage <e> <s> that does not mean to say that we do not have some rather serious reservations and some criticisms some of which i will briefly mention and on which i am sure my noble friends lord grey and lord simon will elaborate in more detail <e> <s> i also support strongly the proposal that the bill should have its committee stage under the new procedures <e> <s> this i hope and believe will be a considerable improvement and will save a lot of the valuable time of the house

the wife who lives at heysham where the earnings are <e> <s> we should compare those situations with londonderry and tyne where the earnings are in the neighbourhood off <e> <s> i am not saying that neath and barrow and heysham are too high and i am not saying that londonderry and tyne are too low i do not know <e> <s> however i cannot believe that it is right that there should be these enormous discrepancies <e> <s> i suggest that that is something which the new proposals will overcome to some extent always in consultation with the pilots <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on these benches endorse strongly the praise that has been given to the brave and skilful men who in appalling conditions rescued the crew from the kowloon bridge <e> <s> i should like to ask for a little more amplification

confess i hope this is not unduly grudging on my part that i cannot see that this is a real breakthrough which helps towards the ultimate solution of the basic problems of the common agricultural policy <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware and is the monopolies commission aware of the potential threat to the refining of commonwealth sugar coming in under the ec-acp agreements that might accrue if the bid by ferruzzi was in fact acceptable <e> <s> is that being taken into account in the decision of the monopolies commission and will it be taken into account by the government in

might expect me to be taking the side of farmers in this debate <e> <s> i have a lot of sympathy with them although i must say that having heard some of the speeches that sympathy is not quite so strong as it was <e> <s> i do not believe that farmers should be treated differently from other producers <e> <s> the fact that they are shortly to go through a difficult time and may be going through a difficult time at present has no bearing whatever on the problem we are now discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord quantify some of his remarks <e> <s> as i understand it he and his colleagues are relying on a reduction in price and a set-aside system either to do away with surpluses although i am not quite sure if he meant that or to enable the surpluses to increase at a rather slower rate than at present <e> <s> it would be valuable to have his clarification on that point and particularly valuable to have some indication as to what sort of price diminution he thinks will be necessary to achieve the desired result <e> <s> under the set-aside scheme how much land does he think should or will go out of cultivation <e>", "<cs> my lords i offer brief but sincere thanks to the noble lord lord john-mackie for giving us an opportunity to discuss this vitally important subject and for the able way in which he introduced it <e> <s> i shall speak as briefly as i can but quickly

responsible whether if british caledonian had not been prepared to take that risk and mr donald woods had been left behind in the country from which he was trying to escape the noble earl would feel happy about that <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support this amendment and to express my hope that the noble earl will at least say that he will consider it sympathetically and carefully <e>",

the broads area <e> <s> will they extend to potential polluters if i may describe them in that way who live outside the broads but whose discharge can have an effect on the water of the broads <e>",

terrified by radiation and obviously they are right <e> <s> it is a frightening matter <e> <s> however while taking seriously the potential risk from eating animals or drinking milk which has been produced from animals grazing on contaminated grass one cannot allow that to give sleepless nights to any consumer in the british isles <e> <s> i think that the noble baroness has put that fairly and squarely <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness give the figure showing whether the number of reactors found over the past years is on the increase or is remaining stable <e>", "<cs> my lords is that an increase or a decrease over the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should declare a personal interest in this matter <e> <s> some years ago my wife introduced on to a pond near our house some decorative ducks which were very beautiful very attractive and rather expensive <e> <s> one by one they disappeared <e> <s> the culprit was diagnosed as a coypu <e> <s> officials from the noble baronesss department were speedily on the scene bringing the appropriate gear which they set in the appropriate places <e> <s> unfortunately they failed to find any coypus <e> <s> however since that time there has been no indication <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and i listened with great interest to his strictures on fur coats may i ask whether i would be right in assuming that he is an adherent to the old saying that diamonds are a girls best friend <e> <s> if so how does he equate that with his very admirable views on trade with south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords first i thank the noble lord lord sefton for giving us the opportunity to debate this important subject and for introducing it so admirably and <e> <s> secondly from these benches i thank and congratulate the noble lord lord goold on his exemplary maiden speech <e> <s> it was a privilege to listen to someone who speaks with such fluency and knowledge of his subject and with such commendable brevity <e> <s> we look forward to hearing far more of his contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble baroness for her clear exposition of this bill <e> <s> she has in a very brief space of time gone through the bill and explained it extremely clearly <e> <s> she has answered many of the questions that i should otherwise have asked <e> <s> i am grateful also to the government for their part in this agreement and i am delighted that it has taken place <e> <s> i hope it will take only a very short time for this bill to become law <e>", "<cs> my lords first let me congratulate the noble lord lord colnbrook on his admirable well-informed and non-controversial speech <e> <s> perhaps a short sojourn in the eastern caribbean has somewhat mellowed his outlook <e>

discuss this enormously important subject and for introducing it in such an admirable manner <e> <s> his speech was scholarly non-partisan far-sighted and painted on a very wide canvas <e> <s> it gave a ideal send-off and opening to this important debate <e>", "<cs> may i as a complete layman whether in french or in english support the noble lord lord mishcon on this matter <e> <s> it seems clear that there is a difference of opinion as to what this clause unamended sets out to do <e> <s> i cannot see any harm whatever in the government agreeing to look at it again with all the expert advice that is available to them and coming back at a later stage <e> <s> if the government and the noble earl can assure the noble lord lord mishcon and the rest of the committee who are in sympathy with his view that his fears are completely unfounded so much the better <e> <s> if the noble earl is unable to do that then we can discuss the matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is and the noble lord will correct me if i am wrong that the payment was due on st january <e> <s> shortage of cash can cause very serious difficulties to the fao or indeed any other organisation <e> <s> can the noble lord inform the house whether it is the normal practice not only of this country but of all other members of the fao to pay their dues roughly speaking a year in arrears <e> <s> if so what effect does that have on the finances of the organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood the noble lord correctly we are in arrears with our contributions which should have been paid within days of st january <e> <s> furthermore we are more in arrears than normal <e> <s> we have normally adopted the practice of paying per cent <e> <s> every quarter <e> <s> this year we have not done so <e>

ashamed of himself <e> <s> is he not equally ashamed of being a member of a government who are in arrears with their due contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble earl is just as anxious as noble lords who have spoken and have put their names to the amendments that this country should not return a would-be asylum-seeker to a country where he will be persecuted on the grounds

perfectly well that the secretary of state has no time to investigate personally the pros and cons of the arguments put forward by the asylum-seeker <e> <s> he obviously and rightly has to take the word of his officials <e>", "<cs> i came into this debate with complete ignorance of education <e> <s> i do not pose in any way as an expert in this matter <e> <s> i came to this particular amendment with a very open mind and no idea of how i would vote if there were a division <e> <s> having listened to the noble lord lord dormand my mind was still undecided <e> <s> he was persuasive but did not convince me <e> <s> however the two noble lords who followed him the noble lord lord beloff and the noble and learned lord lord hailsham were completely persuasive <e> <s> they made up my mind to come down entirely in favour of this amendment <e> <s> i think they made absolutely clear that they were advocating and presumably they speak with a great deal of authority for their own colleagues in very blunt words one law for the rich and one for the poor <e> <s> the rich are those who can afford to send their children to what we call public schools to the independent schools and who will be exempt from the secretary of states dictate <e> <s> the poor are the rest of the people who do not understand about education do not have any views worth holding and do not have any money with which to pay

of these matters on who is actually responsible for air safety <e> <s> is it with the government that ultimate responsibility lies or has it been delegated by the government to the caa <e> <s> does the ultimate responsibility lie with the caa <e> <s> if it is the former have the government the power and the desire to overrule the caa if they come to the conclusion that what the caa does is not compatible with safety <e>", "<cs> can the noble earl tell us what happens to the remaining per cent <e> <s> which is not allowed to be spent by local authorities <e> <s> is it in fact spent by the government loaned by the government to someone else who then spends it or is it simply put under the bed so that the money will not increase inflationary pressure <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell us whether it is the policy of his department and her majestys government to encourage still more trade with south africa to discourage trade with south africa or to remain absolutely neutral in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the whole house as well as my own party i am most happy to be following the right reverend prelate and to be able to thank and congratulate him on a truly fine maiden speech <e> <s> if one looks up his record one sees that he has spent the greater part of his life among the dreaming spires of oxford and the rather differently dreaming towers of westminster <e> <s> nevertheless that has not in any way dimmed his warm heart or his understanding of the problems of other people <e> <s> the picture he has given of the outlying portions of his diocese or the <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government power at present or under the ec directive will they have power to control the export of waste and to ascertain whether or not it is hazardous

<e> <s> therefore the need for further research to enable it to adjust to the new circumstances is even greater than it has been in the past <e> <s> the likelihood of funds being found directly from the industry itself is less than it was several years ago because of the lack of profitability <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much a layman <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very persistent <e> <s> i am very much ignorant of these matters <e> <s> there is one point i have not heard mentioned in favour of having two student nominees <e> <s> normally a student nominee is there for only one year and therefore has very little opportunity of gaining real experience <e> <s> then a new nominee comes along a little later to replace him <e> <s> the other nominees will be there for very much longer and they will become experienced members of the body and able to contribute <e> <s> if there were two student nominees it would be possible to have one senior and one from a junior year who was therefore able to stay for two years and be of very much more value in contributing to the decisions made by the body <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my voice and i think those of my colleagues on these benches to those that have been raised to urge the government to act quickly and efficiently in favour of implementing the spirit behind the noble baronesss amendment <e> <s> i shall not repeat the arguments they have all been made forcefully and clearly <e> <s> however it is essential for us in this country to ensure that the best people and in particular the best younger people are encouraged to go into europe in order to promote our interests purely commercially to promote the european interest and to demonstrate that in spite of some of the things that have been done and said we are essentially in favour of a wider and more effective european community than exists at present <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may settle any lingering doubts that the noble baroness may have about my attitude towards the regulations by saying that i do not in any way oppose the proposals <e> <s> having said that i cannot pretend that i give them a warm welcome basically for the reasons that other noble lords have already put forward <e> <s> i do not believe that this will work <e> <s> what is not sufficiently realised other than by farmers themselves is the very great financial burden they have in the form of fixed costs whether for rent for mortgage interest for bank overdrafts or to a certain extent for wages <e> <s> those things go on year after year whether one is farming acres acres acres or acres <e> <s> something in excess of an acre on a normal efficient arable farm is a low figure for the actual fixed costs <e> <s> if a farmer were offered an acre for taking his land out of production he would be worse off than if he were farming that land and getting a low price for whatever he might have produced on it <e> <s> it would certainly cover his variable costs <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps he can answer one query to which i <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i should like to make just one small correction <e> <s> we used to be the sdp and we still are <e>", "<cs> my lords as always the select committee has produced an admirable report <e> <s> we have now been accustomed for many years to the noble lord lord gallacher presiding over a wise and objective committee <e> <s> he has expounded what the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give us an assurance as regards the leaching of nitrates into the waterways as a result of set-aside and particularly some forms of bare fallowing <e> <s> i understand that there is evidence that that may take place <e> <s> will the noble baroness confirm that that is so and that the ministry is prepared to take steps to see that it does not happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not add to the plethora of advice criticism and suggestions with regard to the economy that have been made by many of your lordships who have great experience and knowledge of such matters <e> <s> i shall confine myself to speaking solely about the environment but obviously that being such a wide-ranging subject i shall not he able to cover anything other than a very small part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that we are already over-running our time but i shall try to redress the balance if that is at all possible <e> <s> i wish at the outset to thank the noble lord lord hatch not only for his speech but for the opportunity he has given us to discuss this vital burning question <e> <s> i wish to a certain extent to follow the fine speech of the noble lord lord goodman and direct the attention of noble lords to human rights a matter which is very much in our minds <e> <s> in the subsequent short debate it will take up more of our time i am sure to our benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i was out of order in my intervention but it was my understanding that after the two main opposition parties had spoken the spokesman of the other opposition party the sdp was entitled to speak <e> <s> however i bow to the ruling of the leader of the house <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the noble baroness one or two questions with particular reference to research <e>", "<cs> my lords all of your lordships will be grateful to the noble lord lord blake not only <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkin of roding started his fascinating speech by suggesting that the opposition say that we have to stick with what we have and that that is the only option open if one refuses this bill <e> <s> i cannot go along with that at all <e> <s> it is perfectly possible to improve what we have without necessarily destroying it lock stock and barrel <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had the privilege of being a member of a great many of your lordships select committees and sub-committees but i can say with complete honesty that my membership of this particular sub-committee has been by far the most stimulating and invigorating experience that i have had in this field <e> <s> the quality of the witnesses who came before us of my fellow members of the committee and of the professional and expert advisers in addition to that of the chairman was outstanding <e> <s> not only was it a pleasure and a privilege to sit on that committee but i believe that the results of its work are of considerable significance <e> <s> it would not be right to touch on all the points that have been raised because the chairman has already dealt with many of them in a most admirable way <e>", "<cs> the objectives of the noble lords lord nugent and lord mcintosh are not very far apart <e> <s> but it is not for us today to discuss the relative merits of the methods they propose in order to achieve those objectives <e> <s> we have before us a very simple means of achieving that which a large number of us wish <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton will not be surprised to learn that i am not as he apparently is a doctrinaire privatiser <e> <s> i have no objection to private or to nationally owned enterprises <e> <s> in certain cases one is better than the other <e> <s> many years ago in company with the noble lord lord john-mackie i produced a pamphlet in which i argued against the nationalisation of agricultural land <e> <s> i still adhere very largely to those arguments <e>", "<cs> i support both the amendments on the grounds that the noble baroness has so ably put before the committee <e> <s> throughout the british isles the rural community as a whole is in a state of flux at the moment <e> <s> there are enormous changes taking place in their main source of income which is agriculture <e> <s> there is also an enormous decrease in the number of people needed to produce food <e> <s> as the noble baroness has said there is an enormous increase in the number of people coming into rural areas who are not necessarily turning villages into dormitories but because their resources are greater they are making it very difficult if not impossible for those people born in the villages to acquire houses there as they grow up marry and wish to bring up a family <e> <s> from time to time perhaps not often enough the problems concerning rural depopulation the closure of village schools and matters of that kind are discussed by members of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am in great difficulty over these amendments <e> <s> i believe they are necessary and on the whole good <e> <s> obviously however certain parts of them could be improved <e> <s> it is no fault of the government but it is unfortunate that in this case we are discussing an enormously complex problem with very wide ramifications simply as an amendment to a bill which deals essentially with water supplies and sewage disposal <e> <s> this matter embraces a very far-ranging technical scientific as well as agricultural and social problem <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first thank the noble lord for repeating the strong and forthright statement of his right honourable and learned friend it is good to listen to it <e> <s> perhaps i may also support the plea of the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford concerning the right of abode in this country <e> <s> there is a great deal of force in what he says <e> <s> i am quite sure that the granting of the right of abode would have a significant effect upon the way that the chinese will treat the chinese residents of hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> it is essentially very sensible and can have a profound effect upon the environment particularly those areas of special scientific interest and enjoyment not only to the rural but to the urban population <e> <s> there is no doubt that demand for water is increasing <e> <s> much of that demand falls upon the aquifers in the eastern counties <e> <s> inevitably those are increasingly depleted with the effect that has been described by the noble lord lord norrie <e> <s> it surely is right as the noble lord lord renton has said that there should be flexibility in this matter <e> <s> when a licence is granted it should not be irrevocable and permanent but should be reviewed at any time in the light of changing circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood the noble baroness to say that it was the responsiblity of flock <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the original question tabled by the noble lord lord nugent can the noble baroness give an assurance that she and her department are completely satisfied that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness give us an assurance that the team of workers that has been engaged on this very valuable and important work at bristol will not be dispersed but that it will be able to carry on as a team in the new locations <e>", "<cs> my lords on these benches we should like to congratulate the foreign secretary on his courage and dignity <e> <s> i wish that we could congratulate on more than that but it is quite clear from what has been said and from the statement and not surprising that his visit was not what one would call a resounding success <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the views already expressed that this is a most valuable report <e> <s> it deals with an important matter and marshals a whole array of facts which are presented in a very clear fashion <e> <s> the report makes it relatively easy for those who were not involved in the actual discussions and who did not hear the evidence to obtain a very comprehensive view of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords it is good that this compromise has been worked out <e> <s> as other noble lords have said it is reasonably satisfactory <e> <s> it is also certainly good that it has the agreement of all those who are concerned and knowledgeable about this very important matter <e> <s> i think that we should be deluding ourselves if we did not realise that there are considerable doubts in many minds as to whether these new arrangements will deliver the goods in the way that we in this house wish them to and judging by the speech of the minister in another place in the way that the government wish <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed privileged in this house to be able to listen to speeches such as <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure us that her department has sufficient information and power to ensure that sheep which have been consigned legitimately from this country to france are not then moved on to spain without any authorisation from us or is that something which it is impossible for the ministry of agriculture to monitor <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start with an apology to your lordships for taking part in the debate at all <e> <s> i have no qualifications whatsoever for doing so and i have very great difficulty in coming to a decision as to what the right course should be <e> <s> therefore my main reasons for addressing your lordships have been the hope that it would force me to clarify my own thinking and to listen to the wisdom and view expressed by your lordships in the course of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the general welcome given to the bill by my noble friend lady stedman and i think i can say by all other noble lords <e> <s> it is essentially a good and necessary bill although as many noble lords pointed out there is scope for improvement <e> <s> many of the proposed improvements have already been dealt with and i hope that i shall not be thought of as being too repetitive if i make further mention of some of them <e> <s> however i shall approach the matter in a somewhat different way to that of other noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i also thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> we express our welcome for the change of tone which is apparent in it <e> <s> there is a very much more flexible and co-operative approach which we are delighted to see because we felt that our influence in europe will be very much greater if we show ourselves as indeed the country as a whole undoubtedly is as true and committed europeans we are not alone in that approach <e> <s> that does not in any way remove from us the right and the duty to criticise certain aspects of proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches perhaps i may thank the noble lord for giving us this statement <e> <s> however i am afraid that i cannot thank him for its contents <e> <s> i accept entirely what the minister says that the responsibility does not entirely or even perhaps mainly lie with us <e> <s> it is a sad day not only for this country but for those countries our friends who call themselves civilised countries that they have refused to help us and above all the vietnamese in this appalling situation <e> <s> we all agree that it is a major world tragedy <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may speak briefly from these benches and as a former very junior colleague of the late lord gardiner pay my tribute to him <e> <s> as has been said he was a great reformer a persistent almost stubborn reformer yet he combined with that persistence and stubbornness great gentleness humanity and goodness <e> <s> he was in every sense of the word a gentleman and all of us who had the privilege of knowing him and working with him are the better for it <e>", "<cs> i should like to emphasise what has already been said by other members of the committee namely the danger of accepting clause as it stands <e> <s> clearly it is much too wide and embraces far too many potentially harmful results from eating different types of food particularly as has been pointed out with regard to allergies of <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord thurlow i should like to preface my remarks with my thanks to the noble viscount lord caldecote the chairman of the committee on which i had the privilege to serve and to congratulate him on the <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the commission and the government on the welcome reduction in stocks <e> <s> however looking at the long-term future with a rising world population and a rising demand because of poor production in eastern europe the soviet union and possibly china is the minister satisfied that supplies of food for this country during the next years are adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that an improvement in rural transport would be of great assistance in reducing the seriousness of this problem <e> <s> at present there are many people out of work in villages who do not have their own cars and who are therefore unable to get to places where there may be work for them <e> <s> public rural transport has diminished very greatly during the past years or so <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any likelihood that a test will be developed which will show whether cows are affected by bse before they are showing signs of clinical disease <e> <s> given the long period of incubation would it not be enormously important to be able to test animals before they have produced offspring and before their milk has been consumed by human beings <e> <s> that can only be done by tests in the pre-clinical stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord oliver and his committee for the report and for the exemplary way in which he presented it to us today <e> <s> it would be arrogant of me to offer any criticisms or comments <e> <s> however i certainly do not accuse him as have some people of psychological insularity <e> <s> perhaps he could be accused as undeniably could i of physical insularity but that is a different and realistic attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord stanley of alderley for enabling us tc discuss this important matter <e> <s> he challenged us or suggested that we should declare an interest <e> <s> sadly i now have no interest to declare having <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on these benches are grateful to the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> we are very glad that the atmosphere in dublin on this ocasion was so much happier and so much more co-operative than at some similar meetings in the past <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the prime minister on her contribution to bringing that about <e>", "<cs> my lords it is far more than convention that brings me to congratulate the noble earl or his maiden speech <e> <s> it is refreshing to have among us someone with the training knowledge and appreciation of the noble earl <e> <s> at the same time the noble earl combines those attributes with the ability to express his views attractively and clearly <e> <s> i share the sentiments that have already been expressed that we shall listen to the noble earl with attention and pleasure on many future occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords it is sad and disappointing that the list of speakers is so short <e> <s> it makes us all the more grateful to the noble earl lord shannon for giving at least a few of us the opportunity to debate a problem of the greatest importance to everyone in this country and others too <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must start with an apology <e> <s> i was under the impression that this debate was to be limited to two-and-a-half hours and made arrangements on that assumption <e> <s> if as seems possible the debate continues for rather longer i may not be able to stay to hear the noble lord lord brabazon speak <e>", "<cs> my lords in his very forceful speech the noble lord lord beloff said that he regretted the fact that prejudice has crept into the debate <e> <s> whatever one may think about the context of his comments if we are honest with ourselves we have to admit that in matters such as this we all have prejudices of one kind or another <e>", "<cs> my lords it would in any case be a great pleasure for one humble farmer to welcome another humble farmer to your lordships house but it is more particularly a pleasure after having listened to the admirable speech of the noble lord which shows the depth of his knowledge on a wide range of subjects and the humanity and consciousness of individuals with which he approaches industrial problems <e> <s> it is an approach which it is unfortunately i might almost say refreshing to meet among successful industrialists <e> <s> i have used those conventional words although not in a conventional way and we all look forward to hearing frequently from the noble lord on this and other subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start with an apology to your lordships and to the noble lord the leader of the house <e> <s> i have to be home early tomorrow morning and unfortunately british rail does not run a late-night service to my part of somerset <e> <s> it is therefore unlikely that i shall be here at the end of the debate for which i repeat my apology and my personal regret <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement we are most grateful to the noble lord the leader of the house for repeating it quite rightly states that the most difficult item is agriculture <e> <s> therefore i should like to ask the noble lord two questions on that most important subject <e> <s> the first is a relatively simple one <e> <s> the statement says that what has already been done by way of reduction of support since will be set against the per cent <e> <s> reduction <e> <s> how much has been achieved since in the reduction of support and therefore how much remains to be argued about <e>", "<cs> my lords little did i think when i first had the privilege of meeting the noble baroness lady castle some years ago that i should have the privilege and pleasure on behalf of your lordships of thanking her for the most stimulating and exciting maiden speech to which i have listened <e> <s> i did not listen to her other two maiden speeches which may have <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first put my name down to speak in this debate there were relatively few noble lords who had already done so <e> <s> it was only today that i realised that the debate would perhaps go on for a time far beyond the last train that i have to catch <e> <s> if that is so it means that i shall not be able to be here for the speech of the noble baroness lady trumpington and possibly for other noble lords and i ask the indulgence of the house for that <e> <s> the reason why i did not withdraw as i perhaps should have done was partly my great interest in the subject and also my particular respect for the noble lord lord middleton as chairman of the committee on which i was privileged to sit and which brought out this report <e> <s> it is indeed a valuable report <e> <s> i shall not go through it <e> <s> the noble lord has done so in a way that would make it otiose for me to do so <e>"]
