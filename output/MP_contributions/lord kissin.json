["<cs> my lords i rise with some hesitation because the noble lord lord seebohm the noble lord lord shackleton and the other speakers have made most of the arguments that refer to the proposal which is before your lordships <e> <s> i want in the first place to thank the noble lord lord seebohm for once more drawing our attention to what i consider to be this most important project <e> <s> i have lived my life to a very large extent in the commodity field as the noble lord lord shackleton was kind enough to say <e> <s> i am proud that the city of london the commodity community of london and the commodity markets in london have achieved a leading position in the world <e> <s> perhaps we are the leading commodity market today <e>", "<cs> my lords after so many formidable speeches in the debate i cannot hope to add any points which have not already been mentioned <e> <s> but i should like to expand and support the excellent summary that our chairman lord greenhill of harrow has given to the house <e> <s> i share his view that all aid programmes carry very high priority in government <e> <s> there is of course good reason for it and one ought not to be too hypocritical about it <e> <s> they are motivated by a mixture of humanitarianism political expediency <e>", "<cs> my lords i also had the privilege to serve on the committee that was so ably guided by the noble lord lord brimelow and which has skilfully brought us face to face with the problems that the negotiators for the next lom convention have to analyse <e> <s> in todays climate the international community is not terribly concerned with lom iii but for the last eight years the european community with the african caribbean and pacific countries has conducted within the framework of the first and second lom conventions a fruitful trade and aid experience which we all know has not however achieved the results that were hoped for <e>", "<cs> i have put my name to the noble baronesss amendment because i want to express my disquiet at the way the government have chosen to proceed in this matter <e> <s> the inquiry should in nomal circumstances have preceded the bill but it is too late to alter this course <e> <s> however i am speaking in support of the amendment of the noble baroness lady birk because i hope that the government will reconsider some kind of procedure so that parliament can exercise its function <e> <s> it can exercise its function only if it is clear what are the governments plans for future action and how clearly they are defined <e> <s> therefore an assurance from the government that some kind of inquiry will be promoted immediately after the bill would relieve many anxieties <e>", "<cs> i am not pleading one-tier or two-tier i am reporting what the inquiry of under lord redcliffe-maud said <e> <s> it stated <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment because i feel that there ought to be some clarity as to what will happen to the parks that are at present administered by the glc <e> <s> i have studied carefully the reply that the noble earl gave me at the beginning of last week <e> <s> he said that i suggested something sinister was in the governments mind <e> <s> i do not suggest that for one second <e> <s> what i suggest is that the government do not know at the present moment how they will proceed with this matter <e> <s> different answers are given in another place to those which we are getting here <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to congratulate the noble lord lord elton on the way that he has conducted the debate <e> <s> the fact that we are all smiling and sitting here in a friendly atmosphere is due to him and the way he conducted the great battle with his protagonists who i think have maintained an atmosphere in the house which is rare and admirable <e> <s> it cannot be found in many parliaments of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to pay special tribute to the noble viscount lord torrington who has patiently and efficiently led the committee through unexplored territory with the help of the special adviser and the committees clerk <e> <s> i for one now have a greater appreciation of the difficulties that will face us as the broadcasting revolution proceeds <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> am i right in understanding that the reduction as regard air fares is solely confined to air fares for the economy class and that the negotiations do not include the club class <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that an increasing number of airlines at present are allocating a greater number of seats to the club class than to the economy class <e> <s> i have been a passenger on a short-haul flight from brussels to this country and there were about club seats and economy class seats <e> <s> is not that a way to avoid the basic agreement that is reached for the reduction of economy class seats <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord indicate when progress in real terms and not in theoretical terms is expected in the new structure within the ec <e> <s> up to the present time we have seen various announcements which are of a very limited nature but we have not seen any real international agreements on a reduction with a timetable as to when that could be realised <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> but may i ask him to clarify why there is a delay in dealing with the pricing policies of the major european airlines <e> <s> in fact as they stand now the pricing agreements come as near to a cartel arrangement as one can imagine <e> <s> in industry and commerce the commission is taking very intensive action against any sort of cartel agreement <e> <s> in that particular instance we had to postpone the time period for six years <e>"]
