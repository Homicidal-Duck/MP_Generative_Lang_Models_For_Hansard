["<cs> my lords i rise to speak on the statement in the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that as a pilot scheme it might be possible to appoint fully-trained nurses full time particularly involved with children to each or at least to a few of the big comprehensive schools and that this would be a tremendous asset in assessing handicapped children at an early stage and of value to the children to the parents and particularly to the teachers to whom the nurse could give help and advice <e>", "<cs> my lords everything that i was going to say has already been said <e> <s> perhaps therefore your lordships will forgive me if i throw away my speech and comment on what has been said by other noble lords in this debate <e> <s> we are particularly grateful to the noble lord lord soper for introducing this motion and i say particularly for the reasons given by the noble lord lord foot that for long years there have been debates in your lordships house that nacro have done a magnificent job of work that there have been pleas from different people throughout the country and yet we seem to be in a worse position today than we were years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for mentioning this <e> <s> i was talking about the difficulty of the trade unions in relation to the secure units attached to mental hospitals not the drug centres <e>", "<cs> may i just make a comment on what children have said to me <e> <s> i believe in the comprehensive principle but in several areas that i know children have said to me we want comprehensive schools <e> <s> why couldnt they have been introduced properly but slowly <e> <s> children in certain areas are suffering because comprehensive schools under the act had to be introduced and they have not been introduced properly <e> <s> children as a result have suffered and know that they have suffered <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to congratulate the maiden speaker who has just spoken <e> <s> i know that he has been a labour party agent since and everyone in the house knows how much members in both houses of parliament owe to their agents <e> <s> i think that i am perhaps the wrong person to offer these congratulations because i know that the noble lord lord underhill worked with the late morgan phillips and i am sure that for that reason the noble baroness lady phillips would have wished to offer the congratulations which i do now <e> <s> i only hope that the noble lord will not be so busy shopping that he will not be able to be here for we need to hear him more in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i specifically said that the figures that i gave did not include either grants from local authorities or payments by local authorities <e> <s> the figures that i gave were entirely voluntary contributions <e>", "<cs> what about confidentiality my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether there is a wide variation in the number of stillbirths per thousand of live births in different parts of the country <e> <s> if there is such a variation what would this be due to <e>", "<cs> my lords mr justice may must be very grateful to the noble earl lord longford for initiating this debate <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord gardiner has pointed out the number of reports by royal commissions which are not debated but while we are all very grateful and acknowledge the work that the commission has done many of us as has been said by other noble lords are somewhat disappointed <e> <s> however we realise that the commission was set up only on th november and it presented its report to parliament in october <e> <s> it was given as the noble lord lord foot pointed out somewhat narrow terms of reference <e> <s> so we pay tribute to it realising its very great difficulties as regards both time and terms of reference while at the same time having to admit how very disappointing we are with some areas of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord mcnair i have torn up my speech and propose to make just a few comments in a couple of minutes <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with other noble lords i thank the noble lord lord nugent for initiating this debate <e> <s> it is with some trepidation that i say to the noble lord lord strauss following his maiden speech that i have been a member of westminster for only four years <e> <s> i therefore pay tribute to him as having been father of the other house but i am in trepidation as i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> what i was referring to was the fact that the written word is completely free and unrestricted and that if it is going to be in shops and anyone can buy it it will be bought and circulated and everybody will see it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that there is confusion about acts of parliament as regards this situation <e> <s> under the children act any child of whatever nationality and in whatever place found homeless must by law be accommodated <e> <s> therefore sometimes there is confusion whether a family should be separated under the homeless families act and not accommodated in which case the children must be looked after apart from their parents <e> <s> can the minister comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i briefly intervene <e> <s> may i ask the indulgence of the house to intervene on points slightly away from these regulations but bearing in mind that there may be a change before next november <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether it is clearly appreciated that in this country there is still the poverty trap <e> <s> i feel strongly over this having made my maiden speech on it <e> <s> the poverty trap means that a number of men and families are better off out of work than in work <e> <s> this applies particularly to the low-paid workers <e> <s> if the child benefits were to be raised then the low paid workers would prefer in fact in any case they would prefer to be in work <e> <s> but many men who are out of work at the moment having calculated that if they get certain low paid work they will have less coming into their house than if they stay out of work opt perhaps understandably to stay out of work <e> <s> if the child benefits were to be raised then many men i would submit particularly the low paid workers would get jobs would be happier within themselves <e> <s> this in fact at the end of the day would redound back on the government and there would not be so much money to be paid out in supplementary benefits <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord for clarification on another point <e> <s> is it suggested that if there is a tape that that tape is accepted as final <e> <s> i have dealt with a number of detainees who are perhaps mentally disturbed or overwrought <e> <s> they will say things and then will say afterwards i did not really mean that <e> <s> is it suggested that what is on tape is final even if somebody says as has often been said to me but i did not really mean it i was in a fuss <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has moved the second reading of this bill with clarity and conviction for which we are deeply grateful <e> <s> he and the noble and learned lord lord scarman have dealt with the general legal points of this bill <e> <s> therefore it would be presumptuous of me to deal with points of law <e> <s> i shall therefore deal with two points of a social and practical nature concerning the daily lives of some people <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask a question <e> <s> if he describes the bee as an animal may i ask whether compensation is paid by the government if there is foot and mouth disease in other animals <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister why it is that in areas of unemployment there are vacancies in the post office service <e>", "<cs> my lords living in oxford as i do it is inevitable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg his pardon <e> <s> i am delighted to see him <e> <s> whether he will be delighted is another matter in view of what i have to say <e> <s> the noble duke gave two reasons why transport should be provided <e> <s> one was that children should be able to go to the denominational school of their choice <e> <s> i am a committed anglican and i have had representations made to me both by anglicans and if i may say so by a very eminent roman catholic that we should think again about denominational schools <e> <s> are we really right to support denominational schools and would it not be right if instead of segregating the various different religions we were to have a home-based religion a religion which was developed within the family and within our churches <e> <s> those children from families that are committed roman catholics anglians and methodists would mix with peers who perhaps had no religion <e>", "<cs> then may i say girls includes boys for most purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many girls who want a very particular education which they cannot at any rate at the moment receive in the state system and we should not deny the girls the opportunity of any special training that they should have <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could put the noble lord right on one matter <e> <s> there are many of us on this side of the house who do not own estates who have come perhaps in one generation or two from an ordinary working-class back-ground and we are proud of it <e> <s> we do not all have money or own estates <e>", "<cs> may i ask what the administrative arrangements are financially <e> <s> is there to be a transfer of financial responsibility <e>", "<cs> may i clarify something <e> <s> i do not wish to refer to special schools but to nursery schools <e> <s> is the noble baroness suggesting that she does not want information or that she does want information as to the schools <e>", "<cs> could i just say with regard to nursery schools that in a number of areas there are not nursery schools to cover the whole of the nursery population <e> <s> a number of parents do not want their children at nursery schools a number do <e> <s> those of us who are social workers do try to get the children most at risk the single parent family children the children who come from very difficult home backgrounds into the nursery schools <e> <s> i for one would not want it specifically published that the nursery would be for those children <e> <s> it might be understood and it might be well known hut i am not sure that that would he a very happy state of affairs <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the great difficulties of administration are fully appreciated <e> <s> under the act handicapped children are divided into ten categories and we have always been against the division of the ten categories <e> <s> nevertheless that is how the matter now stands whereas under warnock the ten categories can be done away with and the emphasis is on childrens needs being met according to their capabilities and requirements <e> <s> they are two completely different definitions <e> <s> to which would the local authorities stick if this were to go through <e>", "<cs> i must reply to the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> it seems to me that education has two facets the first to enrich each individual personand the second to enable each person to be of service to their community and therefore to enrich the community <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords a few days ago the noble baroness lady trumpington was sitting next to me in a debate and she said i itch to get up <e> <s> i should like to speak but i cannot <e> <s> now she can <e> <s> we are delighted that she has made her maiden speech and that she will no longer have to sit quiet <e> <s> she will be able to let us have the wisdom of her experience <e>", "<cs> strange as it may seem i wish to speak against this amendment <e> <s> i say strange because i am the president of the national association of nursery matrons and as such i absolutely approve of nursery education and of course i want to sponsor it as far as possible <e> <s> but despite the fact that all of us have had an enormous number of letters from all over the country i have equally had letters from people and a good many of them teachers and parents and i have here an article out of the ammas magazine not speaking against nurseries but not recommending this amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down may i make one comment <e> <s> although there are nursery schools in france the french prefer their <e>", "<cs> if i may reply i have worked in a nursery school and of course i agree with nursery education <e> <s> i have run a nursery school i have worked in a nursery school and i have seen what it can do for parents <e> <s> what i am saying is that this is not the time when the financial situation is as it is for every local authority to have a mandatory duty to run nurseries <e> <s> i know that at the moment there are many women particularly on some of the big housing estates who are enjoying running preschool play groups getting the time away from their children organising the play groups themselves getting professional help <e> <s> these are women who if there were nursery schools provided by the local authority would feel a kind of inferiority complex and they would have to send their children there <e> <s> the nursery schools would have to grow at a very great rate <e> <s> i do agree that given the money it would be a good thing in time to come for us to have mandatory powers given to the local authorities but i do not think that this is the time particularly as there are so many women who are prepared to organise pre-school play groups <e> <s> in any case i think i am right in saying that it is a permissive power and if in any local authority area it is necessary to run nurseries and there is a big lobby for it particularly in the towns then the local authority has a permissive power to do it <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord whether he is referring just to education <e> <s> there are records with regard to family histories for instance in the pastoral care sections of the school which might be very hurtful if they were disclosed to a great number of people <e> <s> i should like to know whether he is referring to those records as well <e>", "<cs> may i as one who has used these records practically all my working life say that i support the noble lord lord alexander of potter-hill <e> <s> it is good practice on the part of doctors and social workers to treat various documents with confidentiality <e> <s> it does not really need legislating for because it is the good practice of doctors social workers pastoral workers and teachers to regard confidentiality without making particular rules and regulations about it which in some peculiar cases might tie them down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to those who have spoken and to the minister for her understanding of this problem <e> <s> who more than she as the noble lord lord wells-pestell said who has been the chairman of a childrens committee <e> <s> i know only too well the financial constraints throughout the country and having aired this problem i hope that her right honourable friend the minister in another place will take note of what noble lords have said <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i seek information on clauses and <e> <s> i support the change with regard to the new committee the social security advisory committee but first i like other noble lords wish to pay my tribute to professor david donnison and his staff <e> <s> professor donnison has shown compassion has been sensitive to the difficulties of claimants and of staff and has always shown a sense of realism <e> <s> his knowledge and judgment have been beyond question <e> <s> one of his greatest assets has been his originality and approachableness <e> <s> if the supplementary benefits commission is to be abolished and i agree that it should be replaced by the social security advisory committee i wish to have an assurance that the local offices of the social security network will receive the same kind of support help and advice as have local offices in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that on all sides of the house there has been in the past and is at present much worry about the underlying reasons which bring forth an incident such as happened yesterday <e> <s> would not the minister agree that the last government set up a committee of inquiry called the rampton committee into the education and training of children of ethnic groups concerning also the work and unemployment of those children and that the present government have continued with this committee of inquiry and have added members to it <e> <s> would not the minister agree that the first part of the report is to be on the needs of the west indian community <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be of assistance to the committee and save time if i spoke to the two amendments moved by the noble lord lord wells-pestell and my amendment no <e> <s> a after clause which also concerns child benefits <e> <s> with the leave of the committee may i speak to that amendment as well as to the other two in order to save time <e> <s> in essence and in spirit so to speak i fully support the noble lords lord wells-pestell and lord banks and indeed we spoke on this matter at second reading <e> <s> in matters of fact concerning the amendments my amendment is slightly different from lord wells-pestells amendment in that i have set a date of to rather than to and i have related upgrading of the child benefit rate to prices rather than to earnings <e> <s> to that extent what i have done is to agree with and fully support child benefits but in view of the situation with regard to finance and inflation in this country i have in effect deferred the up-rating of the child benefit scheme <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just say that of course i stand by what i said on second reading that in an ideal world i would want the child benefit to be as i said then <e> <s> at this stage i have modified what i said partly because of the very reasons given by the noble lord lord renton that we are in a state of <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i have not quite understood the position <e> <s> may i get clear in my mind the line of responsibilities <e> <s> is the chief benefits officer directly responsible to the secretary of state or is the chief benefits officer responsible to the commissioners <e> <s> secondly on the channel of communications does the chief benefits officer communicate to the social security commissioners <e> <s> if he does not how do the commissioners know what is going on in the country <e> <s> so first i am not clear about the lines of responsibility and secondly about the channel of communication <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to come back again but i am still not clear <e> <s> i am sure that it is my fault <e> <s> if people appeal to the tribunal and the tribunal upsets the decision given by the chief benefit officer which takes precedence <e> <s> where is the difference of opinion between the tribunal and the chief benefits officer documented and to whom is this reported <e>", "<cs> may i make one or two comments <e> <s> first of all i thank noble lords for having spoken to this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord wells-pestell suggested that perhaps claimants would accept help away from the office rather than within the office <e> <s> but i agree with the noble lord lord banks i think there is a very real danger at the moment of an attitude growing up in this country of we and they <e> <s> there are those who go to supplementary benefit offices and find themselves dissatisfied unhappy disturbed then take themselves off to somebody else and want a light to ensue between them and the probation officer the social worker the citizens advice bureau <e> <s> i think this is a pity <e> <s> it is a good service it is a service which ought to be regarded as whole and there ought not to be a we and they system growing up which i think is happening at the moment <e> <s> therefore i would very much hope that this should be within the confines of the supplementary benefit office <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord sandys for his reply and for his interest and sympathy <e> <s> i hope that it will go a little further than interest and sympathy <e> <s> before i withdraw the amendment i should like to say that it is very difficult in the whole field of social service not to look at matters in isolation <e> <s> if social workers in <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord lord underhill not agree that the most important thing is to have the right people and that to get the right people may take some time <e> <s> a panel of people may he drawn up but some of them may not be able to accept and if we were to rush this we might not get the best people <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend three very brief questions <e> <s> first i would ask my noble friend whether immigrants awaiting deportation could be dealt with in bail hostels rather than prison <e> <s> they have not committed an offence such as that referred to by the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> secondly could not juveniles be dealt with within the juvenile system instead of prison <e> <s> thirdly i should like to support the noble lord lord boston on the question of remand cases <e> <s> many people in prison on remand finally get a sentence which is shorter than the time they have been in prison on remand <e>", "<cs> my lords although my name is not on the list of speakers i wonder whether i might ask <e>", "<cs> my lords i think they may have different points systems <e> <s> i may be wrong and the noble lord lord pitt may well be right but certainly the local authorities with whom i have contact had exactly the same points system for everybody in their area no matter who they were they just had to subscribe to the points system <e> <s> secondly when it comes to youth clubs for instance certainly in the area where i worked everybody was entitled to join a youth club whoever they were and thought was given to every single person <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble lord lord gifford in his unstarred question to the minister <e> <s> the children act has sections of which if i may so put it have not yet been implemented and it is not known when they will be <e> <s> it is now <e> <s> all of the sections are <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to say exactly what are the problems concerning staff or lack of staff <e> <s> is it the question of remuneration <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the horse was female or male <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to those already extended by the right reverend prelate the bishop of london to the right reverend prelate the bishop of newcastle <e> <s> it is certainly right and proper that we should hear of the problems of the north bearing in mind that so many of us live in the south and we are most grateful to the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i propose to follow his methods and make my speech a series of questions so as to shorten it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness said that my noble friend is not supported by the people sitting behind him but may i assure him that he is so supported <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join others in congratulating the noble baroness lady mcfarlane of llandaff <e> <s> those of us who are social workers and who have always tried to work closely with others have welcomed the tremendous help given by health visitors and nurses of her profession <e> <s> we welcome her here and are very grateful for the contribution that she has made <e>", "<cs> my lords as the seventh speaker in the debate it really lies to me to underline what has already been said <e> <s> however we all feel so strongly on this matter that i cannot say ditto <e> <s> i must in order to satisfy perhaps my own deep feelings make points made by other noble lords <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i have to say to him how deeply concerned i am about the young people who cannot find accommodation who i think i am right in saying do not necessarily rank as homeless persons under the housing homeless persons act and who very often drift to accommodation which is quite unsuitable for them and into bad ways <e> <s> i shall not elaborate further <e> <s> on the other hand the minister has given the assurance that he will look at this again and therefore i am grateful to him for that because i am sure that in conversation we shall find areas of agreement <e> <s> therefore with his assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment with leave to bring it forward again at the report stage <e>", "<cs> i understand what the noble lord lord gifford has said in principle <e> <s> i have experienced the terrible situation of a woman leaving a home on a constructive desertion clause and i as director of social services have had to find her accommodation when i have felt she had every right to the house that she had left <e>", "<cs> having listened to all that i wonder why there is a single empty property in this country <e> <s> if all this enormous procedure is going forward and if the department of the environment is informed how come that there are many houses in many streets and the figures that i have given tonight bear this out boarded up <e> <s> there must be something wrong with every house so that it cannot be used <e> <s> however i understand the difficulties having been in local government myself and feeling better as a result of having aired this terrible problem i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was to have moved amendment no <e> <s> and i am grateful to the minister for taking the amendments together thus saving time <e> <s> but i am sorry to press the minister on this point <e> <s> the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> was to bring to his notice that where housing associations are running very small hostels for very difficult people not only the rent is included but also board and lodging <e> <s> to divide the rent from the board and lodging is in fact going to entail a great deal of administrative work for the small housing associations for in fact very little money <e> <s> i imagine from what has been said that the secretary of state will take this into account <e>", "<cs> can i say to the noble lord how much we are enjoying this <e>", "<cs> i cannot but say that i am disappointed with the ministers reply because i believe that at this stage we need to monitor what we are doing for the chronically sick and disabled <e> <s> however i shall consider what he said and at this stage beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might take this opportunity to thank my noble friend the minister very much indeed <e> <s> the directors of social services throughout the country are very grateful indeed to the minister for having effected this amendment because it will make very much easier the staffing situation which as the bill stood before would have been difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister if this is the way to do it whether he would not agree that the local authority social services act in the first schedule covers all these voluntary organisations because those voluntary organisations carry out for the local authorities the work which the local authorities are not themselves doing at the moment <e> <s> the minister has said that he will look into it <e> <s> i would be quite happy with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend the minister for his reply <e> <s> i have no regrets about having put down this amendment because i think it is very right and proper that we should have aired this extremely difficult situation <e> <s> i have been in the north lately and in my own area there is evidence indeed there is evidence throughout the country that local authorities are taking a different line from the one they have taken in the past and that they are much more aware than before of their duties towards those who need housing and about using up stock in a way that can meet the problems in their areas <e> <s> i am glad that we have had this debate <e> <s> i am sure that local authorities and the housing associations will read <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mottistone has asked me whether i would speak to this amendment as i have had experience in this area <e> <s> it is just a small amendment to clarify the difference between licensees and tenants <e> <s> i know from my own experience that courts are not at all clear as to the difference between the two <e> <s> if it is a tenancy it is often regarded as a secure tenancy and causes a great deal of trouble when people coming into an area as homeless under the homeless persons act are given a secure tenancy and therefore keep other people off the waiting list <e> <s> of course they are entitled to great consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as an ex-director of social services who was responsible for administering the health services and public health act which is the act of parliament which lays down that a local authority must give assistance and help to the elderly unable always to help themselves <e> <s> i would like to support this amendment of the noble lord lord banks on three counts <e> <s> first of all cost <e> <s> our difficulty in this country is that we always look at lists of columns separately and not together <e> <s> this would save the country paying out supplementary benefit to a number of people who otherwise would have to receive supplementary benefit <e> <s> secondly it would save cost in the provision of alternative accommodation for the elderly when they have to leave their homes and although figures have been mentioned i think it has not always been costed taking into account the cost of an old peoples home or wardened accommodation <e> <s> the cost of keeping someone in an old persons home now is between and a week <e> <s> in view of the number of people this bill would cover local authorities could save a great deal of money <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend why should council tenants be treated any differently from private sector tenants <e> <s> you do not refuse to sell a house in the private sector because a person is wanting to use the house for a purpose for which they should not use it <e> <s> why should this apply to council tenants <e> <s> surely the noble lord lord ross of marnock is applying a different standard to council tenants as opposed to those in the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether it is fully appreciated that the first of the thalidomide children are now adolescents and will soon be coining up to leaving school <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that with unemployment as it is in this country and bearing in mind the needs of adolescents who are thalidomide cases there is great need for extra help and support <e>", "<cs> i speak as a former chief officer of a local authority <e> <s> i apologise to the minister because i still do not understand the question of flexibility as between one authority and another <e> <s> do i understand that if reference has to be made for capital expenditure to the department of the environment money can be transferred from one authority to another authority because one is spending too much and another too little <e> <s> i just do not understand this point <e>", "<cs> if i may rise again i should find it exciting if i were the recipient but whether i would find it quite so exciting if i was the one who had to give i am not quite sure <e> <s> however i am most grateful to the minister for explaining it to me <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether in our schools colleges and universities we are teaching the technology of the microchip so that the children of this country are brought up in the way of working in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must ask for the indulgence of the house as i have an engagement made some time ago which will preclude me from being present at the end of the debate <e> <s> i apologise to my noble friend the minister and to the noble lord lord wells-pestell <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> i should have said more than disappointing <e> <s> i apologise and i thank the noble lord for drawing that error to my attention <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend lord belstead would have wished it the other way round <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister the foreign secretary for that reply which i am sure will bring at any rate some comfort to the families to the friends and to the many people known to the four who are detained in iran at the moment <e> <s> may i ask the foreign secretary whether he agrees that ayatollah khomeini bases his life and the life of his nation on his religious beliefs <e> <s> therefore would it be possible for a group of christians from this country to make representations personally to the ayatollah so that he will understand that the christians in this country have a deep concern for those and other people held in iran <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether special constables are now helping the police who are very overburdened <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that it would be a good thing to increase the numbers in the probation service since bearing in mind the present cutback in public expenditure it is less expensive to keep men out of prison and to rehabilitate those men who have left prison than it is to keep men in prison <e> <s> does that not also provide a very much better service for the country <e>", "<cs> i quite agree my lords <e> <s> but my point was that there was perhaps a feeling that the present government were not giving adequate attention to the needs of the disabled and to the social services and that i would contend is not so <e> <s> of course the white paper does not go as far as many of us would wish <e> <s> nevertheless i make a plea to the minister for very careful planning of the implementation of the recommendations of the warnock report <e> <s> members of your lordships house will remember the children and young persons act <e> <s> in my view that was a good act but to a very great extent it has failed due to lack of planning and lack of training <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this small bill <e> <s> it is not a world-shaking bill

reply <e> <s> i am sure that the citizens living abroad will be grateful for it <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether during his review it was found that the number of united kingdom citizens living abroad for a short or long spell has greatly increased and therefore this matter is of double the importance it was before <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it is known how much money is being spent by local authorities under the homeless persons act upon placing homeless families in hotels and boarding houses instead of in empty properties <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise

and local authority services <e> <s> as an ex-director of social services i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for raising this matter in the house today <e> <s> in his opening speech i think i am right in saying that he threw down a friendly gauntlet to the back benches on this side and i suspect to me in particular as an ex-director of social services <e> <s> therefore in a friendly way i pick up the gauntlet and seek first to establish truth in various areas of this debate and secondly to see how in the circumstances in which we find ourselves today we can look for some solutions <e> <s> but i wish to point out that i am only going to cover local authority social services <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wells-pestell is absolutely right <e> <s> this matter has puzzled us <e> <s> i think that the secretary of state has had difficulty in squaring the money that he has allocated for social services with what is going on in the local authorities <e> <s> i cannot say whether the secretary of states assessment is right or whether the directors of social services are right <e> <s> i only know that both are puzzled <e> <s> as a result of that i am informed although i was not able to check it this morning that there is a committee being set up with members from both sides to look at both reports and to see exactly where the truth lies <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the very difficult situation in the oxford region where there has been disagreement between the department of health and social security and the regional health board thereby holding up the establishment of a secure unit <e> <s> and again what has happened to the money in that instance <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e> <s> in doing so perhaps i may let the minister know that when i set this question down i had not read the green book on school curricula which has emanated from her department <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> may i ask her first whether her department is happy about the quality of teaching of languages and secondly whether particularly as regards eec languages languages are supplied by the school or have to be paid for by the parents <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord vaux of harrowden is to be congratulated for

jeger for taking part in this debate and also to thank the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne for the very satisfactory reply he has given <e> <s> i should like to make various comments on it but in view of the lateness of the hour and the other business which is to come before the house i will not make any further comments other than to thank the noble lord for all that he has told us this

and the money that is being drawn in supplementary benefits for those men to be out of work <e> <s> can he indicate how this could be done <e> <s> because in this sector and in other sectors many of us would like to see this done but are in some difficulty over trade union law and as to how much a man should be paid over the supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too <e> <s> thank the noble baroness lady seear for initiating this debate <e>", "<cs> yes but if women pursuing careers cannot also have children the population would drop <e> <s> we must face the problem of how we are going to help women who want both a career and to be a homemaker and a mother <e> <s> if we talk only about women having a career then we denigrate the institution of marriage <e> <s> marriage is a career and the art of being happily married and having a career is perhaps one of the greatest privileges that a woman can sustain <e> <s> i would ask the minister although i do not think that he can answer this whether it is the governments intention really to look at this problem of supplying back-up services for women with younger children so that they do not lose their place in the career structure and can give their children the love care sensitivity and quietness which children require with the result that in the future our society will be one that has grasped the changing role of women but has not deprived children of their birthright <e>", "<cs> may i add one or two points <e> <s> first it is extraordinarily difficult to get some people to take up benefits and there is nothing you can do which will make them take up <e> <s> i might also perhaps suggest to my noble friend that one of the very real difficulties is that the citizens advice bureaux are the bodies best able to give advice and many of them at the moment are very short of money and partly short of staff <e> <s> perhaps that is something we could give consideration to <e>", "<cs> my lords like other

to the secretary of state for education for responding to the recommendations made in the report of outstanding quality on the special educational needs of children so ably chaired by mrs mary warnock <e> <s> i think the noble baroness lady david said that she gave only one cheer and afterwards she said that she gave a weaker second cheer <e> <s> my lords i give three cheers <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that it would be enormously helpful if there were an inquiry department in each supplementary benefit office so that everybody would know exactly to whom they could apply at a supplementary benefit office for the detailed information they are seeking <e>", "<cs> obviously if the child cannot stay at home there are several courses that would be open <e> <s> in the case i cited the child might go to a home from mondays to fridays and be at home from fridays to mondays when the father was at home and could support the mother <e> <s> in other cases it would mean going to a residential school <e> <s> in yet other cases it might mean a foster home or it might mean day care with the child coming home in the evenings <e> <s> these are the avenues which are open but if it is not in the bill there will not be the terms of reference for payments to be made <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble baroness this is a problem and it is a difficulty <e> <s> however if good work is to be done in this area each case must be treated to meet its needs <e> <s> if the needs are that the child should be in a small house with a garden then it is to be hoped that the social workers working with the housing department and the education department will be able to meet those needs <e> <s> however strangely enough there are some parents who are very robust and who can deal with a quite severely handicapped child in the home without damaging the other children <e> <s> there are other parents who are less robust and that is nothing against them at all it is just the way they are made who cannot deal with a handicapped child who perhaps has not a serious disability or impairment <e> <s> therefore i think that every case has to be treated according to its needs <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> i should also like to say to the noble lord lord banks that i have met many children who away from their families can learn but who with their families cannot learn <e> <s> it was for that reason that i moved the amendment <e> <s> however i shall read what the minister has had to say very carefully tomorrow <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what the noble lord lord somers said because it seems to me that already there is provision for this as indeed in a later amendment tabled by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> i am a member of the council of dr barnados and we have as resource centres schools residential and day schools for handicapped <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for her explanation and for her comments <e> <s> i have to say that i am not wholly convinced or happy because these facts and figures have been known to the des as she herself has said and yet many of us know of children in mental hospitals for instance who have not been educated even if the facts have been known <e> <s> however this was a probing amendment <e> <s> if i may i should like to read in <e>", "<cs> i think that the principle of a plan is magnificent but in reality it has not worked in the past for those of us who have been in local government <e> <s> i remember that in another area we were asked to get out a ten-year plan <e> <s> the officers of the local authority spent hours getting out a ten-year plan when suddenly the whole thing was reversed by a change of policy <e> <s> all of our ten-year plans and all the work involved went for naught <e> <s> therefore i think that it is important to have a plan within the local authority but to produce a ten-year plan is quite unrealistic based on experience <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to make just one comment <e> <s> i think he said i said that there might be a change of policy with regard to the treatment of the integration of handicapped children <e> <s> i was not referring to that i was referring to the change of resources because on the one hand if you bring out a ten-year plan and the resources are very much less than they were before your plan is wasted <e> <s> if by happy chance your resources double equally your plan is out of date <e>", "<cs> may i point out to the noble baroness lady jeger that i absolutely agree with her but i just wanted to make the point that if a child does not get that extra help it is going to leave the home in some other way through another channel <e> <s> i included in the amendment the words or at a prescribed centre and if the child is going to be too difficult for a peripatetic teacher to deal with for three hours on end and i have every sympathy with the teacher one would hope that the local authority would have alternatives either within the school or outside the school for these particularly difficult children <e>", "<cs> i am almost grateful to the noble baroness the minister for her reply <e> <s> i am sure that psychiatrists educational psychologists and social workers will be very grateful to hear that it may be possible for a parent to challenge the health education being given while the child is at home <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should just like to ask a question <e> <s> i think that in all the areas where i have worked the community physician is the link between the hospital the doctors and the local authority <e> <s> we have found that this has worked because there is this particular link and each of us has always been informed <e>", "<cs> it is a matter of practice rather than putting anything into the act <e> <s> my experience of dealing with such children is that if there is complete openness and a relationship between parents and the doctors schools social workers assessors <e>", "<cs> in order to save time and not to go over the same ground again i wonder whether under this amendment i may speak at the same time to amendment no <e> <s> in which it is recommended that as well as notifying the local education authority the local social services department should also be notified <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i just say that although many of us do not agree with corporal punishment we are in an awkward position <e> <s> i do not think that this is either the time or the place for this paragraph to be put into the bill for the reasons which the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill has given that if we are to have integrated schools how are we going to distinguish between a child who is handicapped and a child who is not handicapped <e> <s> but that is not to say that i agree with corporal punishment <e>", "<cs> i support the spirit of the amendment but i am not sure i support its structure <e> <s> the committee will recall that i moved amendment no <e> <s> in which i begged that the bill when it becomes an act should be monitored because as i pointed out we have suffered in the past from passing legislation which had not been monitored <e> <s> therefore while agree with the spirit of the amendment i could not support it because i am not sure that i agree with the method proposed in it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend the minister for that reply i should like to ask him first when is the research likely to be published and known <e> <s> secondly would he not agree that almost inevitably community police that is the policemen on the beat are likely to have knowledge of and a relaionship with the people in their area which is far better than that of any other police <e> <s> thirdly i wonder whether my noble friend is able to say anything about the berlin scheme the berlin police having copied the english police in their system of community policing and now being said to have improved on it <e> <s> is the minister able to comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree with the noble baroness lady david as to the need to monitor the progress of this bill when it becomes an act and what happens year by year <e> <s> furthermore i am sure it is very important that everyone should <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill is not in his place today but i understand that it was difficult for him to come <e> <s> he was after all a director of education and i was a director of social services <e> <s> some years ago the then minister of health sir keith joseph ordered a development plan for the social services and every single local authority throughout england had to get out such

not see the documents on which the report was made they do not see the case file <e> <s> i just wanted to clarify that point <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount say to what extent these schemes have reduced the number of unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i wonder whether i might make one small comment <e> <s> residential care for handicapped children is very expensive <e> <s> it costs something like or a year <e> <s> if a number of those children are going to be educated at home there will be a considerable amount of saving to local authorities <e> <s> i just make that small point <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree it is strange that under the chronically sick and disabled persons act the mentally handicapped <e>", "<cs> my lords with other noble lords i wish the right reverend prelate the bishop of worcester well <e> <s> i would say to him that those of us who retire from a job within three months find ourselves busier than ever <e> <s> i am sure that it will be the same with him <e> <s> to the noble lord lord stodart of leaston i would say that many of us are looking north of the border to the juvenile court

the noble baroness <e> <s> i should say that that does not happen up and down the country in every court <e> <s> certainly now that the fathers are perhaps more available maybe it might be possible <e> <s> what of the future <e> <s> i would say that this bill is a somewhat cosmetic measure <e> <s> i wonder whether this bill could be a forerunner to more creative effective far-reaching measures which are preventive and which will help the young offender in the context of his family of his school and of his community <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether he would not consider that there must be an advance on two fronts within the prisons but within the community too <e> <s> if there are to be fewer people in prisons there must be somewhere outside for them to live <e> <s> unless there is held a conference of organisations such as the church army the salvation army and many other bodies in order to set up hostels it will be very difficult to avoid

robson of kiddington referred <e> <s> consider my lords the number of people with whom psychiatrists will have to deal <e> <s> are they ever going to be able to work <e> <s> there will be the mental health review tribunal <e> <s> there are the area region and district health authorities and the hospital advisory service <e> <s> will there not be serious overlapping <e> <s> therefore despite the boynton report i question the setting up of the commission as another structure <e> <s> i would rather see us get the grass roots work properly organised <e> <s> i shall perhaps put down an amendment

what is the difference from the point of view of the state and the health service <e> <s> they are both state services <e> <s> therefore you are not taking away the responsibility from the nearest

matter further <e> <s> i think that from what we have heard from the benches opposite and from the noble lord lord winstanley we are looking at the position of the social workers now and gearing the

the fact that the noble lord lord wallace of coslany was so generous to me over amendment no <e> <s> a i am sorry not to be generous to him over this amendment <e> <s> i believe if i may say so that we have all read exactly what he said in a pamphlet which i think he has received from a certain organisation <e> <s> those of us who have dealt with cases like this know that very often you can give a better service first if you know the hospital secondly if you know the staff and thirdly if you know the patient <e> <s> if you have a relationship with the patient you can very often do things with that patient that according to this pamphlet he would not like <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i think that perhaps i ought to come clean to your lordships committee and say that i set this down as a probing amendment in order to be able to talk about the training of social workers <e> <s> that was forestalled of course by the amendments of the noble lord lord wallace of coslany and we discussed the matter then <e> <s> i take the point that it is a descriptive role <e> <s> at the same time i take the point of the noble lord lord wallace that we should discuss this matter further <e> <s> therefore at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment but i shall reintroduce it at the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for his mention of voluntary organisations <e> <s> if local authorities are in financial difficulties and many of them are may i remind the noble lord that the voluntary organisations i am

<e> <s> the particulars of this are to be found in a book <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that despite the very good work done by many voluntary organisations the local authorities by virtue of the cut-back in expenditure are finding themselves unwilling or unable to use the voluntary sector and therefore in many cases clients are not receiving the best kind of service that they might otherwise do <e> <s> can my noble friend comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend the minister whether he could bring to the notice of the chancellor of the exchequer in another place the fact that for instance the minister reported in the house last week that the nspcc were to have a grant of but in vat they are paying to <e> <s> moreover from the point of view of the partnership with local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend the minister for that reply is he

committees and the manpower services commission in relation to salaries the setting up of schemes and rents <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that reply <e> <s> i appreciate that there are questions of staffing but may i ask him whether it might be wise for a survey to be carried out bearing in mind that in there were patients in hospitals for the mentally ill and that there was a drop to leaving vacancies <e> <s> would it not be possible despite the probelms of staffing to place the mentally ill patients at present in prisons in these hospitals <e> <s> secondly may i ask my noble friend what is happening about the mental hospitals that are closed and standing empty <e> <s> could they not be used for relieving the pressure in the prisons both for the mentally ill and for others <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that it is very sad that these children should be as they are at this age <e> <s> should we not look at our preventive services and help these children at a much earlier age so that this situation does not arise in adolescence <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord elton and with this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord renton i am very troubled in my mind <e> <s> the noble lord lord winstanley has been so eloquent and put the case so very well that i almost hesitate to disagree but i ask myself two questions <e> <s> first if there is an independent person alongside the doctors to take a decision will they perhaps feel that it is so irreversible that they would rather decide in the negative <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord wallace of coslany that social workers who have not been experienced previously in the mental health field should be qualified with the certificate of training in social work <e> <s> however there is a proportion of older people who have been doing mental welfare work for many years and i agree with the noble lord that they should be exempt <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do of course support the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> the last time we met i myself moved an amendment for after-care and therefore i support the spirit of the amendment moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> what i am not so sure of is arriving at how this amendment is to be implemented <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend the minister for sending me a number of acts of parliament since the last debate so that i could study them <e> <s> reading the various acts of <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord hunter for initiating this timely debate

the medical profession the social work profession and voluntary agencies to speak on the balance as between the care of patients within the hospitals and the care of people in particular categories in the community bearing in mind the present financial constraints <e>", "<cs> does not the minister consider that as drafted the bill reduces the privilege of charities <e> <s> bearing in mind what was said by the noble baroness lady stedman and the noble lord who has just spoken i would point out that those of us who are very much engaged in raising money for charities are all too aware of the great problems facing us at present with vat <e> <s> to have imposed yet another problem would lead to real difficulties for charities two aspects of whose work i would mention <e> <s> one aspect is the involvement of the local community in the charity and its precepts and the other is the fun of living in a village and being able to run these kind of affairs <e> <s> therefore i support the noble baroness in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble lord lord renton for initiating this debate which calls attention to the rising crime rate which is of concern not only to this country but as the noble lord lord wigoder stated to other countries as well <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord wigoder suggested that it might be a good thing if there were an international inquiry into the rise in crime rates throughout perhaps the western world <e> <s> i do not know that i would go quite as far as that but i suggest that it would be enormously helpful if there were an inquiry into the rise in crime rates within the eec perhaps that would be more manageable <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> can he give the reason why there is this long delay <e>", "<cs> my lords we are most grateful to my noble friend lady gardner of parkes for initiating this debate at this time <e> <s> in part and only in part i am sure that the planning not only of our inner cities but also of new estates outside the inner cities has as the noble lord lord evans of claughton said produced problems of law and order unhappiness and lack of satisfaction

people throughout the length and breadth of the land who are pressing for the modernisation and clarification of the law relating to charity <e> <s> i would ask my noble friend the minister who is to reply two questions and make one comment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord longford has many times raised in your lordships house the question of the position in our prisons and yet again we debate it today <e> <s> i feel that the noble earl wishes to tell the minister the time has come as the walrus said for something to be done <e> <s> as a tribute to the late lord butler i wish to take up the point made by the noble lord lord avebury about mentally-disordered prisoners <e> <s> why after all this time when the money has been available have there not been the secure units set up in all regions <e> <s> i suggest that the psychiatric profession the doctors and psychiatrists with whom i have worked and for whom i have the greatest admiration have not accepted their responsibilities in this area <e> <s> ideology unrelated to reality can be uncreative and many of the psychiatrists have said we cannot treat prisoners unless they wish to be treated <e> <s> we cannot treat prisoners in secure accommodation <e> <s> as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister say which local authorities are going back on their policy of buying old property with a view to building new estates but have not now the money to do so <e> <s> are such authorities reversing their policy to any great extent putting the houses in order and shelving their old plans <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> can he explain a rather perplexing position <e> <s> in view of the fact that the figures for expenditure on personal social services have risen in real terms how is it that in some though not all local authorities there has had to be a cut-back in the services provided <e>", "<cs> my lords i now have been in your lordships house for six years and on only one other occasion in those six years has there been a debate in your lordships house on the needs of children and their families and that was during the international year of the child <e> <s> therefore we are very grateful to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for initiating this debate today <e>", "<cs> than in any other country in the eec my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the main purpose of this bill is the protection of children and a very particular group of vulnerable children <e> <s> i am referring to those children in the care of a local authority who are sent to live in privately run childrens homes <e> <s> unlike all other kinds of accommodation for children in care it is an astonishing fact that these private childrens homes escape control of any kind <e> <s> most of them provide a satisfactory and in some cases excellent standard of care <e> <s> but it is scarcely surprising that over the years there have been a number of disturbing incidents affecting children who live in them incidents usually involving their exploitation in one way or another or dubious standards of accommodation or staffing <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> in answer to lady loudouns questions homes will need to apply for registration from the date that the bill commences <e> <s> the registering authority then has a period of up to months to come to a decision <e> <s> during this period homes may continue to operate <e> <s> after the commence <e>", "<cs> in that case i will answer the noble baroness on that matter <e> <s> article of the community homes regulations does not do away with corporal punishment this applies to local authority homes and states that corporal punishment may be maintained on the basis of personal and professional relationships <e> <s> that means that we have not done away with corporal punishment although that is the effect of it because with problem and difficult children it is dangerous to give them corporal punish <e>", "<cs> my lords is there a liaison structure between the relevant ministries in the planning of adventure playgrounds and other playgrounds <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend also agree that the wives and mothers of the men of the task force and those who made it possible should also have tribute paid to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall confine my few remarks to the question of children and young persons <e> <s> this is i suggest not a great bill <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord wigoder who called it a modest bill <e> <s> it is a bill which deals in certain areas with the mechanism of the administration of juvenile <e>", "<cs> my lords by their fruits ye shall know them <e> <s> why i say that with such firmness is that i think it seems that why custody is underlined rather than the non-custodial treatment lies in the financial position <e> <s> the figures that i think are going to be allocated for custodial care are very high <e> <s> non-custodial treatment is provided by the local authorities <e> <s> local authorities have been cut down in their expenditure and cannot develop non-custodial treatment <e> <s> if non-custodial treatment is thought so highly of by the government it will have to be subsidised from central <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manu-script amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i had written a speech and had meant to speak to it but as i am the eleventh speaker i have decided to put it aside in order to counter some of the arguments which have been put forward in this debate <e> <s> i wholly support the principles and the precepts behind the youth task group report <e> <s> i should not want it to be thought that i do not support those principles and precepts <e> <s> nevertheless i say with great diffidence that i thoroughly disagree with the way in which it is recommended that those principles should be carried out <e> <s> i feel slightly nervous about saying this when speakers such as the noble lord lord kilmarnock the noble baroness lady seear and the noble lord lord scanlon disagree with me <e> <s> nevertheless i feel that i must say it though i do so with great diffidence <e> <s> i was grateful when heard the speech of the noble lord lord young of dartington for i felt then that there is one other person in the house who is of my opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may respond to the noble lords remarks <e> <s> it is not giving young people time to fill in it is helping them as part of a bigger programme to use and to understand the needs of the community as well as training for industry <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he has been talking about people coming into town but would he not agree that it would be far better if there was a better bus and rail service <e> <s> then not so many people would come into town by car <e> <s> many would come by bus and rail <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that if there was a park-and-ride system this would prevent an enormous number of people from coming into the inner cities by car <e> <s> i know that for instance in oxford we have three park-and-ride systems which prevent about cars coming into the city every day <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> in moving this third reading it is perhaps not inappropriate that following the statement made by my noble friend the leader of the house and lord privy seal i draw attention to the fact that this is the first bill to go through your lordships house since the birth of the royal child and it concerns the wellbeing of children <e> <s> this bill is concerned with the protection of those children in the care of local authorities who are sent to live in privately run childrens homes <e> <s> at present these homes are not required to be registered and this bill redresses this anomaly <e> <s> there are some children in privately run homes in this country and if this bill passes through this house these homes will be registered and inspected <e> <s> i should say that the association of independent householders who represent privately run childrens homes are in agreement with the bill <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would help my noble friend the minister if i were to say that i understand that the short sharp shock was based on experience at glenochill detention centre in scotland <e> <s> glenochill detention centre has had the short sharp shock for some considerable time <e> <s> would it help the committee and the minister

to these benches but i thank him for inviting me to the liberal benches <e> <s> could i first take up the point made by the noble lord lord hutchinson <e> <s> obviously he is very well versed in these matters but perhaps i could say with the utmost diffidence to magistrates that not all magistrates know what goes on in the court of appeal <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i

wagon to a star <e> <s> i believe one can help young offenders <e> <s> i do not take the gloomy view of the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> i think we have got off the tracks but that we can get back on to them <e> <s> perhaps over the next few years we may try to get better relationships between the social services and education and we may try to help with the <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> there is another aspect to this problem and it is concerned with the question who is to treat the people involved <e> <s> my experience is that at the moment in the psychiatric service one cannot get psychiatrists or mental hospitals to accept a patient if he is not willing to go for treatment <e> <s> those of us who have dealt to a considerable extent with drug addicts know that they will not go to a clinic <e> <s> if the people in question are to be handed on to the national health service will the nhs in fact take them <e> <s> i ask that

lord lord elwyn-jones hit the nail on the head <e> <s> we are in impasse <e> <s> i think i should say that there are of course places for the mentally ill under youth custody orders but there are not enough of them to deal with all the mentally ill young offenders <e>", "<cs> i should like to make just two points <e> <s> one is that the situation is very strange since standards are laid down by the department of education and science for all their establishments and standards are laid down by the department of health and social security for all their establishments <e> <s> in addition many of the establishments run by the social services departments take young offenders <e> <s> how then does it happen that two ministries have very strict standards and one the home office does not <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak for one moment about resources <e> <s> we are all very worried <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend the minister for saying that he will look again at the matter <e> <s> we shall await with interest what occurs next <e> <s> until the report stage therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very greatful to my noble friend the minister for what he has said <e> <s> may i ask him this to get this quite clear <e> <s> do i understand that legal aid is available in the cases we are talking about but that it is not mandatory <e>", "<cs> i can hardly rise to my feet when the noble and learned lord said that we are not really concerned with the resources aspect in this matter <e> <s> i think that we are in some state of confusion here and the noble and learned lord has put the confusion very clearly <e> <s> the most vulnerable are the least likely to ask for help a point made by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> it was for that reason that the all-party parliamentary group considered this to be such an important amendment to safeguard those who quite frankly could not help themselves <e> <s> i find it very strange when one considers that we do not have the numbers of those who have asked for legal aid <e> <s> from my experience in the juvenile court i only once remember a young person and a family asking for legal aid <e> <s> indeed they did so because i recommended and took them along to a solicitor to get legal aid against myself then the director of social services <e>", "<cs> i understand the position of my noble friend the minister over this <e> <s> i cannot understand why it can be done in scotland and not here but we have not got quite the same legal system here <e> <s> at this point i will beg leave to withdraw the amendment in order to give one an opportunity to discuss amendment no <e> <s> with the understanding that it will be possible to bring it back at report stage <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> we are in difficulty because a care order is very wide and has several arms <e> <s> if a care order is made it is open to the local authority social services department to place the child in a childrens home a small one with only children if you like or to place the child in a foster home or i do not agree with this as i have let the committee know to place the child back at home <e> <s> we must therefore realise as the minister said how flexible a care order is <e> <s> having said that it is true that under the childrens homes regulations there is provision for the child to be reviewed <e> <s> but difficulty comes when for instance a child is moved into a community home for education which is not in the area of the local authority and often those children do not get reviewed because they are as it were at a distance <e> <s> it is essential that every child in care be it in a community home for education in a childrens home or at home on trial should be reviewed <e>", "<cs> as chairman of the committee on new approaches to juvenile crime i support the proposal that the clause be left out <e> <s> i shall not make a speech since the case has been so well put by the noble lord lord mischon <e> <s> i rise to say merely that i support it <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down i should like to ask him whether he agrees that the difficulty was that the magistrates wanted the clause for a very good reason <e> <s> they wanted it because there was bad practice in respect of the care order and we come back to the same question again and again <e> <s> i would suggest that my noble friend consulted an enormous number of people <e> <s> i think that the consultations were very full and that much time was given to them <e> <s> however i think i am right in saying perhaps this will be agreed that it was the magistrates association that was involved <e> <s> i wonder whether it is agreed that one should have sympathy with the magistrates association because there was bad practice on the part of the social services perhaps understandably bearing in mind difficulties over time and one thing and another <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down am i to understand that it is the governments policy in the long run to have enough accommodation so that juveniles on remand for criminal offences are not sent to prison <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> it is quite obvious that it would be extremely embarrassing and very difficult for the government at the drop of a hat to provide secure accommodation for these young people <e> <s> having said that i agree with the noble baroness lady birk that to send them to prison is quite monstrous <e> <s> but the government are facing in the right direction they are aware that this is a very great problem and to my certain knowledge more secure places outside have been provided <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble baroness lady david that the reviews do not always take place but let me add that they should take place <e> <s> there has been some bad practice as i suppose there is in every sphere of life <e> <s> i am informed and i have seen it for myself in travelling around that the situation is improving and that people are beginning to be aware that these reviews must take place <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord lord avebury if i misrepresented him <e> <s> i do not feel i am able to pursue the legal position we are waiting to hear what that position is and until that happens we can go on talking until we are blue in the face <e> <s> i would rather go on hard facts and wait for the information which the minister is to give <e> <s> i would remind the noble baroness lady david that the secure accommodation provided for adults is very different from that provided for children and young persons and there is a very caring attitude for many of our youngsters placed in secure accommodation <e> <s> that does not do away with the fact that they have lost their liberty though as i told your lordships during second reading one girl said to me that she longed to be in secure accommodation just to be alone <e> <s> since my noble friend the minister has said that the regulations are to be reviewed perhaps we should wait until the report stage to consider the matter further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes i thank my noble friend the minister for that reply <e> <s> she will read with interest what he says and perhaps bring it back on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i should like to ask my noble friend the minister whether an approach has been made on a co-ordinated basis and whether the social services together with the health authorities have been approached on the implementation of this report <e>", "<cs> my lords following on the question asked by the noble lord lord banks will my noble friend not agree that the hospitals are having to accommodate a number of elderly people who could more happily and better be cared for in the community were the resources available <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down might i ask a question because i regret that some of us were not in the committee during the earlier part of the debate <e> <s> if a car has been clamped the driver has to go to find someone to take the clamp off <e> <s> if the car had been taken away surely a space would have been left for another car to come <e> <s> if the clamp is on then that immobilises the car in the space for another car <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend the minister for his explanation of that amendment <e> <s> i agree with him that the criteria laid down in clause is not entirely satisfactory for defaults <e> <s> therefore may i say that i should like to consider the question of criteria and perhaps reserve the right to bring this forward at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the all-party parliamentary group i support the noble lord lord hunt in this amendment <e> <s> i do not think that it is fully appreciated sometimes by our colleagues in the home office what it means when a young person goes to prison <e> <s> that is where they start <e> <s> they make friends and they are got hold of <e> <s> i have dealt with many boys who have got into trouble subsequent to being in prison and when i have asked why are you mixing with this person or that person <e> <s> they reply that it is because they met in prison and arranged to meet them when they came out <e> <s> i strongly support this amendment and i support the noble lord lord hunt <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in a very real dilemma <e> <s> my noble friend the minister has pointed out to me that perhaps the amendment is not worded exactly as it should be and he has agreed to take the matter back <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady bacon has said this is a complicated matter because i also have had experience of trying to get a child into a mental hospital <e> <s> let me say at this stage that i do not think that the home office and the department of health and social security have come to terms with one another as to whether treatment should be given who it should be given by and where <e> <s> i think that i almost and i repeat almost feel like pressing this amendment in order for that to be done <e> <s> but having been given the assurance of the minister that this matter will be looked into <e>", "<cs> my lords as the intention is right and i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for clearing up the point i hope that my fellow workers on the all-party penal affairs group would agree that i should withdraw the amendment until the next stage <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose this clause and all these amendments both in practice and in principle <e> <s> first of all i absolutely agree which makes it difficult with the idea behind the amendments which is to put family responsibility on to families <e> <s> i know that this was the way in which the magistrates who recommended this amendment were thinking that responsibility should lie with families for their children <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend <e> <s> i am coming on to that aspect <e> <s> if you say to a child in court will you accept a curfew or will you accept night supervision <e> <s> the child will say almost anything <e> <s> although

may i say that there are many mothers who will agree to anything <e> <s> they do not know what they are agreeing to however <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to say that i support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down would he not agree that once one has got on the ladder in other words if a child is in care and commits a further offence it is almost an automatic reaction on the part of magistrates then to say that the care order has failed and that therefore they will make a residential care order <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i have made my point <e> <s> i regret that my noble friend the minister is not able to meet this point <e> <s> i quite agree that it is in the bill and i only hope that everybody reads all the bill that they can <e> <s> my knowledge of social workers and magistrates is that they only read the particular bits of a bill with which they are dealing at any point in time <e> <s> however i am not going to press this amendment today and i

serious in mental hospitals when they are having to deal with section cases for compulsory admission under the <e>", "<cs> my lords my experience and knowledge is that many of the doctors are standing in for the staff because of course the patients must be cared for and therefore must we not congratulate them for doing this <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that there are some prisoners who cannot be transferred <e> <s> i intervene briefly simply to say that from the point of view of prison staff and social workers dealing with prisoners it is far easier to deal with them in the prisoners home areas <e> <s> also from the point of view of family visits it is much easier than having to bring a family as i had to do from scotland to see somebody in oxford it would have been simpler if the prisoner could have been transferred from oxford to scotland which was his habitual home <e> <s> therefore with reservations over certain cases i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank

previous amendments <e> <s> i understand the two exceptions which have been made but i hope that the minister will see to it <e> <s> over the years that these two exceptions are phased out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in a real dilemma over the amendment in that while i prefer what the noble baroness lady david has proposed to what is in the bill for the reasons she gave i much prefer the amendment which stands in the name of the noble lord lord wigoder and which we shall be discussing later <e> <s> that being the case i hardly know what to say because while in a way i do not agree with the government i do not agree with the amendment and i am anxious to speak in support of lord wigoders amendment <e> <s> nevertheless i have a few practical points to make at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords during my working life i have been privileged to work in birmingham and in two london boroughs and also in devon and cornwall nottinghamshire derbyshire and leicestershire <e> <s> conditions in all those places are very different <e> <s> if you are in devon or cornwall and indeed hertfordshire which is the county where this originated it might be possible to implement a night restriction order even if it were very unpopular simply because if you live in a house with a garden or you live on a farm or if you live in an area where it is quite possible to stay in that is one position <e> <s> it is quite a different position if you live in a high-rise flat in a london borough in a family with perhaps four children or possibly where yours is a single-parent family <e> <s> in that case it is quite a different matter for a parent to enforce a curfew a night restriction order <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the governments amendment and i should like to make some comments on amendments nos <e> <s> to proposed by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> i wonder whether we should first look at these amendments of the noble baroness through the eyes of a child <e> <s> may i suggest that hours or three days is too short a time in which to bring a case before the court <e> <s> if one is dealing with a difficult disturbed and maladjusted child it is very disturbing to that child to take the case to court at that early stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that reply <e> <s> if the argument is that child offenders and court cases should not be singled out from others i wish i had put down an amendment to say that all children should be reviewed with an independent person <e> <s> the point of limiting it to offenders who have appeared before the courts was simply because the court cases come in at a different door <e> <s> they may be treated the same they may be looked after the same but they have entered the care through a different channel <e> <s> the magistrates are not concerned with children who come into care for other reasons only for court reasons <e> <s> that is why we felt so strongly that there should be an independent person <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to pose a problem whether to my noble friend the minister or to the noble lord lord mishcon i am not quite sure <e> <s> i am a little worried about the situation where parents are fined for the misdemeanours of their children fail to pay the fine and continue to fail to pay <e> <s> i think that this kind of thing has actually happened <e> <s> there are an enormous number of very good magistrates but there are some who might perhaps make a mistake <e> <s> mistakes have been made parents have been fined and then children have been left without a parent because the parent has gone to prison for the non-payment of the fine <e> <s> i am puzzled as to how that situation should be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend answers that point i should like to be clear on one or two points <e> <s> under amendment no <e> <s> subseciton <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put another point of view in supporting my noble

had many patients who refused to go into hospital on a voluntary basis <e> <s> they fell into the category of the grey area they could be voluntary they could be statutory <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord hill of luton will agree that there is a band of patients who fall into a kind of grey area <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to provide for the better use of parochial

lords i join others in thanking the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for introducing this subject today <e> <s> with time so short i confine myself to social factors <e> <s> as the noble lord lord winstanley said nothing is outside the scope of the noble and learned lord who is to reply <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble lord lord wallace of coslany because my amendment no <e> <s> is practically the same and the wording of this amendment is very much better than mine <e> <s> one cannot plan facilities in a local authority without consultation with the voluntary organisations concerned including the people supplying private housing particularly for the elderly <e> <s> therefore i very much support this amendment and hope that the government will be able to accept it <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure of the procedure <e> <s> may i speak again <e>", "<cs> i am not clear on one point <e> <s> my noble friend the minister said that the secretary of state can appoint somebody

called for a triennial report on the work being done but it was felt that this was not possible <e> <s> this report would however be available to parliamentarians and to the public at large <e> <s> if

amendment <e> <s> at this stage therefore and only at this stage i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i particularly wanted to speak last <e> <s> i support this amendment but with sadness and misgiving <e> <s> with sadness because there are many single parent families with whom social workers work and with whom they have a very good relationship and they should have a good relationship <e> <s> they are able to talk to the mother and put the point of view to her would she rather a section resolution be taken out or would she rather the case goes to court <e> <s> in the many cases with which i dealt under section of the children act a large proportion of mothers did not want to go to court <e>", "<cs> not unnaturally i am disappointed by the reply of my noble friend the minister because the situation could work the other way <e> <s> the amendment provides that if two-thirds of the membership of a regional planning committee wish it to continue it shall continue <e> <s> taking into account what the minister has said it seems that the minority can control the majority <e> <s> i have personal experience of this kind of situation arising from when in a voluntary capacity i was responsible for setting up a small hostel for very difficult boys <e> <s> local authorities which had used it did not continue to support it <e> <s> they withdrew their boys and so we had to close the hostel <e> <s> one of two boys who had been in the hostel for three years is now serving a prison sentence of nine years and the other is serving a sentence of five years <e> <s> i

this and think about it and if i may discuss it with him <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to the reply given by my noble friend the minister and inevitably it is deeply disappointing <e> <s> if as he has said great care is being taken over the training of social workers i have to come back to my original point how is it that only per cent <e> <s> of people working in residential care with children and with the most difficult children are trained and only or per cent <e> <s> of those working with the elderly and handicapped are trained <e> <s> this really means that local authorities are not seconding or supporting those who are most in need of training at the moment although i would wish to say that with the

lord lord banks also lead to fragmentation <e> <s> how does the minister think that the bill will lead to a unified health service with all the different parts of that service <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord a question before he sits down <e> <s> with whom is he saying the family practitioner committees should work the district the region or the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my

years prior to the time that this government came in <e> <s> having said that however the social services need more <e>", "<cs> my lords while understanding the feelings of the two noble baronesses and the noble lord lord banks i am not at all clear about the law in relation to this amendment <e> <s> if a child is accepted into care under section of the children act that means that the child is accepted into care at the request and demand of the parents <e> <s> at any point in time the child can be withdrawn from care and no local authority can stop that <e> <s> if a child is in care under section at the request of the parents and if a local authority refuses either to allow the parents access or to allow letters to pass the parents can withdraw the child at a moments notice <e> <s> that is under section of the children act <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> of course this clause does refer to children in care <e> <s> i would be grateful if the minister could help us because for instance on the figures produced by the department of health and social security there are in fact children in the north who are being cared for in mental hospitals when there are vacancies in homes that could care for them <e> <s> i know that discussions arc going on at the moment but this is one of the reasons why the noble baroness and i felt it was important that this should be discussed in your lordships house <e> <s> not only do we believe in the principle of it but we are also worried about how in practice it works out <e> <s> i therefore support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble lord lord howie of troon who asked whether there is duplication that what i meant by duplication is that if a local authority seconds somebody to a course then they pay for the secondment they pay for the course <e> <s> but at the same time they have to pay for the person who has taken their place <e> <s> that is the duplication <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley for his intervention <e> <s> taking the various points that my noble friend the minister has made it is the cost that he is most worried about <e> <s> we all vary in our estimates as to how much it would cost <e> <s> there are between and vacancies on courses in this country <e> <s> it is quite true therefore that if the awards were mandatory those places would probably be filled <e> <s> that is one point <e> <s> the second is that if it were mandatory they would be filled by the best students because at the moment the discretionary awards do not necessarily go to the best students they go only to the students which the local authorities are prepared to second <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i cannot agree with my noble friend the minister because the decision as to who should take the course <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the strong points which my noble friend the minister made was that this would open the doors to an enormous number of people wanting to train <e> <s> but it is not an open-ended affair <e> <s> if there are only a certain number of courses and only a certain number of places then it is not open-ended <e> <s> one can only have the number of students who apply <e> <s> one cannot have an open ended situation <e>

some very good ones and we have some excellent courses <e> <s> but our profession is growing <e> <s> we must grow slowly but surely and with the best people <e> <s> we cannot mushroom and grow simply because there are going to be mandatory awards <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he will remember that at the last stage of this bill i moved an amendment that the council which numbers only should be composed simply and solely of professional people from both the statutory and the voluntary sectors <e> <s> i recommended that then because there were so many people from both the voluntary and the statutory sectors including my noble friends organisation and because with only places and several of those places having to go to the local authority associations a number of organisations would necessarily have to be left out <e> <s> it will be remembered that i recommended that it should be a professional body consulting with the local authorities <e> <s> furthermore will the noble lord also say whether when consulting with the organisation of my noble friend lord renton he will also consult with the other statutory and voluntary organisations as well <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just thank my noble friend the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed this on the previous stage of the bill and i wish to say that i support the noble baroness lady masham of ilton

registrar be put on the certificate <e> <s> would that be completely outside the possibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether the management team is to visit every

cemeteries the provision of secure accommodation which means that people cannot buy a house in the middle of a cemetery <e> <s> because of the changing roles of the various local government departments would not my noble friend agree that there are other areas of operational land held by local authorities upon which there are houses which are at present and which will continue to be unless the bill is amended further subject to the right to buy <e> <s> i am referring to houses in parks recreation grounds and council depots and to at least one in a restricted area at luton airport

do not have a vested interest or if i do it is in the government of this country as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords as a retired director of social services it is perhaps inevitable that my special area of concern with regard to the need of management in the health service is to ask the minister what is managers particular role under the griffiths report in connection with the setting up of joint projects as between health social services and voluntary organisations in the community <e> <s> if hospitals are to be run efficiently giving services to those in need of treatment and medical care then it must be the managers concern to see that those in hospital who could and should be treated in the community have the facilities to receive such a service <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak about this amendment and with your lordships permission i should like also to speak to amendment no <e> <s> in order to save the time of the committee <e> <s> i agree with the spirit in which the noble lord lord ennals has spoken and also with the noble lord lord seebohm <e> <s> but i question the wording of the amendment because for different reasons both the noble lords lord beloff and lord renton have given different reasons as to how these words could be misinterpreted <e>", "<cs> thank you for that support i hope that you will support me in the rest of it <e> <s> i must just take up two points which were made by my noble friend the minister <e> <s> the first concerns the fact that the local authorities must decide <e> <s> as an ex-local government officer i of course support what he says but i am bound to comment to the committee that i have had personal experience of local authorities who take the stance that there should not be a voluntary sector and that welfare services should be run entirely by the welfare state <e> <s> they are therefore hoping to get rid of the voluntary organisations in their areas <e> <s> i very much fear that this is something that might happen <e> <s> when my noble friend the minister says that local authorities are free to decide i have to draw to the attention of your lordships committee the possibility that local authorities could decide against the voluntary sector on political grounds <e>", "<cs> in the terms of gilbert and sullivan i speak to your lordships house as a good little conservative <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord lord marsh and to the noble earl lord onslow that we cannot afford not to afford and not to support voluntary services <e> <s> we must be careful not to throw away a resource <e> <s> the voluntary sector is an enormous resource financial and in every other way <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the amendment on the ground that it is cost-effective <e> <s> i speak particularly about the friends of various hospitals who have made it possible together with the joint financing to get patients out of hospitals and to keep them in the community <e> <s> in that way accommodation has been made available in hospitals particularly the long-stay hospitals the mental hospitals where patients have been helped to leave those hopsitals by the voluntary sector thus cutting the costs of the hospitals <e> <s> however i am sure that the noble lord lord ennals will understand me when i suggest that as we have taken back the previous amendment he should consider taking back this amendment also so that the two can be considered together <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to speak and ask questions on clauses and <e> <s> clause as your lordships know concerns the new severe disablement allowance which will be introduced to replace the current non-contributory invalidity benefit and housewifes non-contributory invalidity benefit <e> <s> while welcoming as other noble lords have done the abolition of the housewifes duties test the new severe disablement allowance is for many reasons cause for concern <e> <s> i am sure that other noble lords will pursue this subject particularly the per cent <e> <s> test the age cut-off and the medical and social implications <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> before embarking upon my speech let me say how glad we are that the noble lord lord meston is to make his maiden speech in this debate today <e> <s> we are <e> <s> indeed fortunate in that he is a barrister and therefore well versed in the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i will first congratulate the noble lord lord meston on his clear knowledgeable thoughtful and compassionate speech <e> <s> it was the kind of speech which members of this house welcome and we hope that he will speak often in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that the real problem lies with the pushers and that in fact it is quite easy to get heroin <e> <s> will he ask the police what particular action they are taking with the pushers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether it is true to say that his right honourable friend the secretary of state has done a survey into the whole position with regard to social security <e> <s> can this matter not he looked at with more care than has been shown in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> we take note of what he says <e> <s> indeed i think i referred to the principles behind the bill when i introduced this amendment <e> <s> may i turn to what i might term our rejected and deprived peer the noble lord lord marsh i am glad he has the minister to support him because i fear he has nobody else to do so and as an ex-director of social services i really feel i ought to offer him care <e>", "<cs> my lords yes may i say to the noble lord lord marsh that i am as an ex-director of social services and as a member of the conservative party anxious to cut back and for local authorities to keep within a reasonable expenditure <e> <s> but i would like to take up a point made by my noble friend lady elliot it is cost-effective to support the voluntary organisations <e> <s> i think this is the point that perhaps the noble lord lord marsh has missed out <e> <s> it is not only financially cost-effect <e> <s> we are not a completely materialistic world and there are other qualities of life and living which voluntary organisations in partnership with local authorities can engender in our society <e> <s> we would be a poorer country if we had not got the ethics and the ways of the voluntary organisations <e> <s> good as the local authorities are voluntary organisations are able to do things of an innovatory nature which the local authorities cannot <e> <s> obviously the noble lord lord marsh does not wish to be accepted into care and therefore i withdraw the offer <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this amendment but in a slightly different way from that put forward by the noble lord lord hunt managerially the funding of the probation service is to put it mildly a muddle <e> <s> first as the noble lord lord hunt has said the local authority pays per cent <e> <s> and the home office pays per cent <e> <s> meanwhile the local authority has no jurisdiction and rightly so over the probation service <e> <s> in many areas there is a local authority representative on the magistrates committee which is the committee which controls helps and guides the probation officers <e> <s> therefore there is no sense of accountability from the point of view of the local authority to the probation service <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a difficult debate in which to speak <e> <s> i presume to do so as one who has worked in local government for nigh on years four years of which were spent with the then london county council <e> <s> i have been involved in three reorganisations <e> <s> in case your lordships should think that i am biased in favour of local government i should also add that i have spent many years as a civil servant <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i should like to speak to both amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> as regards amendment no <e> <s> naturally i have the deepest sympathy for the amendment for the reasons that have been put forward by the noble lord lord ennals and the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> however a number of us in the social work field did not altogether agree with the priority groups that were noted in the circular that went out to the local authorities <e> <s> in different parts of the country there are different problems <e> <s> for instance many of us at that time were very worried about the problems of the single parent family the homeless and families with children <e> <s> there was also the question of the citizens advice bureaux <e> <s> therefore as regards amendment no <e> <s> i would be a little unhappy if priority were to go into the bill <e> <s> that is not to say that i am not very sympathetic to and very understanding of the reasons why the two noble lords have tabled this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there was nothing moral about the protection of children act <e> <s> the main purpose of the bill was to safeguard the well-being of children <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise very briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> in dealing with amendment no <e> <s> moved by my noble friend lord bellwin he said that there were two aims underlying this bill the restraint of high spenders and at the same time the retention of local authority freedom of decision <e> <s> the present world recession has forced the government to restrain high spenders but we sincerely hope that the world recession and the need to enforce rate capping will in the years to come diminish and perhaps disappear <e> <s> therefore it seems to me that we should have written into this bill a review of the situation so that ultimately local authorities will be given back their freedom of decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the noble lords reasoning in tabling this amendment together with amendments nos <e> <s> and which would lower the age of a child in respect of whom the offence of abduction under this bill could be committed <e> <s> this amendment seeks to bring the age of the child into line with the recommendations of the criminal law revision committee as the noble lord lord mishcon has explained on which much of the bill is founded <e>", "<cs> i can well understand the concern to which the amendment gives expression concern about the impact of the bill upon a family that has never had recourse to the courts in divorce or other proceedings and where children are not the subject of a custody or equivalent order <e> <s> i hope that i can allay that concern by showing that the provisions of the bill are intended to strike a balance in this kind of case such that clause will be effective without being too oppressive <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may add one extra comment <e> <s> the bill must address the unilateral action of a parent in taking a child out of the country but where the court judges on the facts that consent was unreasonably withheld it is surely right that this should constitute a defence for the parent who has removed the child <e>", "<cs> once again i must acknowledge the careful and sensitive motive behind this amendment which would reduce the maximum penalty for offences under this bill from seven years to five years <e> <s> the latter would preserve the power of arrest which is vital to the proper enforcement of this measure and which would be lost if anything lower than five years were proposed <e> <s> perhaps i might explain why i do not think we would be wise to lower the penalties at all <e> <s> this bill replaces the old offence of child stealing with two offences based on the offence proposed by the criminal law revision committee and making a distinction between parental abduction and others which i believe we all accept to be proper so that the parents will not be brought further than is strictly necessary into the scope of a criminal offence in relation to actions upon their own children <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> these amendments seek to provide for uniformity in the maximum penalties available under the bill among scotland england and wales <e> <s> although i would agree that having the same maximum penalties for the same statutory offences north and south of the border is desirable i think there are good reasons for the differences which the bill presently provides <e> <s> therefore we cannot accept these two amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords can i ask my noble friend the minister whether he agrees that this representation of parents on governing bodies can legitimately and effectively apply to particular special schools for instance schools for maladjusted children where the children come from a wide area over england and it is difficult for parents to be represented on such a body <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble lord lord mishcon for the comments he has made because obviously he thinks and feels very deeply about it <e> <s> may i also thank my noble friend the minister for replying <e> <s> i say at once that i am indeed glad to accept the amendment moved by the noble and learned lord lord scarman <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to him for taking such an interest in this bill and for taking the trouble to ensure that the bill continues to be consistent with what has been decided in relation to the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that convictions is not a great number but children damaged is a considerable factor in terms of the happiness of those children <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that a number of mode b training centres have lately been closed <e> <s> does he agree that these training centres are run to deal with the most vulnerable young people who do not fit at this particular time into employment <e> <s> has the manpower services commission followed up what has happened to those young people who are now not in employment at all and who have no training centre to attend <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> in so doing perhaps i may thank those noble lords who took part in the various stages of the bill in your lordships house <e> <s> i believe that it returns to the other place and to its promoter mr timothy wood the member of parliament for stevenage an improved bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i am afraid that i am not reassured because i do not think that it is fully appreciated how a social service department works <e> <s> you cannot separate medical data from social work data when each is dependent on the other <e> <s> unless i do not understand computers i do not see how when you are making a recommendation that a child should be adopted or not adopted because the medical record says that the child will not live for very long and therefore the case should not be recommended for adoption you can separate out that tiny middle sentence upon which the social work decision is going to be taken by the adoption committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that there is a technical difficulty <e> <s> the problem is that it has arisen towards the end of the bill <e> <s> if it had arisen a little earlier things might have been easier <e> <s> up to the moment we have been talking about the medical data which must be safeguarded but there are other data which have to be safeguarded by social workers <e> <s> as i said in my speech the information on the computer of the social services department includes besides sensitive medical information information which is also very sensitive from the point of view of personal relationships from the point of view of the courts and from the point of view of confidentiality as between clients <e> <s> am ito understand from the minister that that information is safeguarded and if that is so how is it safeguarded <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully accept the delightful chiding of my noble friend the minister <e> <s> this should have been said at an earlier stage <e> <s> nevertheless it was not possible for me to take part in the data protection bill when it was before your lordships house <e> <s> but that is no excuse <e> <s> i have to say <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may comment from my practical experience of what used to happen when i was working in court <e> <s> the accused was informed of what would happen <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend the minister for his assurances and i shall read in <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask my noble friend the minister this question <e> <s> if a young person is likely to need to be remanded for more than six hours or even for less than six hours is it possible for him to be held by the local authority rather than to be detained in the police station for that length of time <e> <s> i have to confess that this has often happened to me in the past whether rightly or wrongly and it seems to me that this would meet the point of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend the minister <e> <s> through him may i say that there are many young persons who will run away <e> <s> i have known young persons to run away from police stations <e> <s> i would rather that they were taken to secure accommodation within the local authority <e> <s> my experience is that however great absconders they may be children can be held in secure accommodation run by the local authority <e> <s> i believe that this is how it should be <e> <s> if it is not we should work towards it <e>", "<cs> as a very ordinary lay person i wonder whether i may briefly intervene <e> <s> i presume to speak having dealt on a practical plane with many of those who have been before the courts as accused persons <e> <s> i have also had to deal with many of the police who are my colleagues and have been my colleagues and have worked in the community <e> <s> a short time ago in another debate the noble lord lord mishcon said that i was a very practical person and i therefore wish to apply practical issues and seek for information from the noble and learned lord lord scarman when he comes to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may intervene because i think we are getting slightly confused here <e> <s> there is a difference in child care parlance <e> <s> one talks about long-term cases and short-term cases <e> <s> if one is talking about long-term cases and short-term cases the noble lords comments are absolutely valid but if one is talking about a crisis situation with a child just charged at a station it is quite a different matter <e> <s> as i understand it if they are in the care of a local authority children and young people are safeguarded in a crisis situation which is quite different from short-term and long-term situations <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all be grateful to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for raising this subject in our debate today <e> <s> it is a timely debate in as much as the voluntary sector feels under threat <e> <s> it is this threat that is of deep concern not only to the voluntary sector but also to the statutory sector <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> may i just say that i did go into all this <e> <s> i am very grateful that the noble lord has brought up this matter <e> <s> what i think the noble lord lord bellwin the minister at that time on the rates bill said was that he would consider issuing guidelines <e> <s> then when i went to him at a later stage he said that there were going to be other arrangements and therefore guidelines would not be issued <e> <s> the document to which the noble lord now refers relates to the arrangements for discussion with the voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords when this point was discussed under the rates bill several of us the noble lord lord kilmarnock being one asked whether local voluntary organisations could be informed that they could apply to the secretary of state if they were cut and whether he would consider the financial position of the local authority <e> <s> the minister later said that he could not send out letters such as that to the voluntary organisations <e> <s> therefore it is not surprising that nothing has been received because the voluntary organisations know nothing of this <e>", "<cs> my lords we all like to think that we are unique and from these benches may i say to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney that i think i speak as the only chief officer in this debate having served in central government as a civil servant for years and in local government for years <e> <s> therefore with great diffidence i speak from the point of view of a chief officer in local government <e> <s> secondly i must apologise to the noble baroness lady nicol because i feel compelled to speak about the greater london council having served at any rate for five years on what was the london county council <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i have not seen the curriculum vitae of the people who hold the posts in london transport but i would suggest that they were not professionally qualified to hold those posts <e> <s> i believe that the greater london council should be replaced by an elected regional authority covering not only the area of the london boroughs but also the outer london boroughs and possibly beyond <e> <s> winston churchill said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether it is the intention of her majestys government to appoint at any rate to some of the managerial posts people from outside the service <e> <s> if so are the salaries

a reasonably high standard for their children <e> <s> are they to be debarred and are they not allowed to enter the community programme <e> <s> secondly despite the fact of what my noble friend the minister has said would he not agree that the present recommendations do discriminate against women <e>", "<cs> my lords like other members of your lordships house i support the establishment of a

were passed but were not implemented or certain sections of them were not implemented <e> <s> i was going to draw the attention of the committee to that and to suggest that her majestys government might consider monitoring this bill by asking for instance a polytechnic or a university such as brunel university which is running a course for trustees at the moment to monitor this act when it is

see her at the dispatch box <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether he knows of the growing practice whereby when children are very difficult in school a meeting is called of the parents the education department the child and the social services and a scheme drawn up with the agreement of all of them perhaps for a change of school perhaps for a change of boarding school or day school <e> <s> in that way parents child and teacher are helped <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale who has made a compassionate realistic plea on behalf of those who have suffered permanent disability damage or death as a result of vaccination <e> <s> perhaps i may also support the noble and learned lord lord denning who called for the implementation of the recommendations of the royal commission on civil liability and compensation for personal injury the pearson report which as i understand it called for a no-fault scheme to compensate children damaged by vaccination <e>", "<cs> during the debate in the other place my noble friend lord eltons ministerial colleague sir george young said that the voluntary organisations needed stability security and permanence <e> <s> those were i think his words <e> <s> first however i wish to pay tribute to my noble friend lord elton for upping the million to million <e> <s> in

who sat on the fisher committee may i ask my noble friend the minister whether she would bring to the notice of her right honourable friend the secretary of state the difficulties that there are in supplementary benefit offices from the point of view of managerial structure <e> <s> very often the people on the counter dealing with claimants are very young girls much to be admired and respected

to be welcomed <e> <s> however like other noble lords i wonder why it is separate from the bill that we are to consider later <e> <s> i should like to make four brief points <e> <s> on the question of

because that covers exactly the same points as the noble baroness has made <e> <s> is that acceptable to the committee or does the minister prefer not to do that <e>", "<cs> i will speak later <e>", "<cs> i feel that i must speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not want to be done out of my little speech <e> <s> i apologise if i repeat what has in some cases already been said but i should like to make two points <e> <s> first i believe that the wording of amendment no <e> <s> is perhaps a wiser wording than the noble baronesss amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> when i was a social work student more years ago than i care to admit i found that i had to study economics and social policies and even as a student i found that social policies and economics cut across one another <e> <s> i find it so in this bill <e> <s> i have hesitated to recommend what i wished because of financial aspects <e> <s> throughout the whole of this bill we have had to strike a balance and look at priorities <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble lord lord henderson on this amendment <e> <s> what concerns me is that the noble lord lord henderson has said that it cannot cost much <e> <s> that is true <e> <s> but if this amendment is not accepted it is going to cost a lot to some other authorities namely the local authority social services and the local health service <e> <s> the social services are simply going to have to accept into care the elderly the handicapped or the children and that is very costly it is costly in forms of finance but it is also costly in terms of happiness <e> <s> therefore by not accepting this amendment one is going to shift the financial responsibility from the ministry to the local authority and most local authorities have been rate-capped <e> <s> also i think that i am right in saying that at least per cent <e> <s> of the social service departments in the country have had their estimates cut <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down may i ask whether the association of directors of social services have been consulted and their members feel that their departments are not going to have extra financial pressures put on them <e> <s> may i also ask whether the local regional hospital boards equally support this amendment <e>", "<cs> like others i should like to congratulate my noble friend lady trumpington on the announcement she has made concerning the administration of family credit <e> <s> on the question of school meals we are in a very real difficulty between what is idealistically right and what is realistically true <e> <s> in a perfect world i would absolutely agree with everything the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said <e> <s> but it is not a perfect world and there is the problem of the here and now and there is the problem of the future <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend the minister for that reply <e> <s> in the first instance i said that this was a probing amendment because i was not at all clear whether these cases could be dealt with by income support or the social fund <e> <s> of course what worries me about the social fund is that it is finite and i am anxious about what happens if at the end of months it runs out and there are another two months left <e> <s> however i think it would be wrong to embark upon a debate on the social fund at this time because we shall be considering it at a later stage <e> <s> therefore i shall look up the act and read it very carefully <e> <s> shall withdraw my amendment and perhaps bring the matter up again at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i do so having had an extraordinary personal experience when the ugandan asians came to this country <e> <s> as a chief officer of a local authority i was given the duty of finding homes for and rehabilitating families <e> <s> at that time the local authority said it could not give them council houses <e> <s> i then went to oxfam and posed my problem <e> <s> at the drop of a hat and without any more ado the then director of oxfam gave me a cheque for <e> <s> with that i bought a house in which i put one family <e> <s> i then mortgaged that house to buy a second house <e> <s> in the end i bought houses with that <e> <s> that was all right until it came to putting them in the house <e>", "<cs> no all the ugandan asians paid off their mortgages within years <e> <s> there was the problem of their immediate needs <e> <s> it would be no good having a discretionary payment from the social fund if one had to argue who should or should not receive it <e> <s> in the case i have mentioned i knew exactly what they could have <e> <s> they knew what they could have <e> <s> it was therefore possible on a minimal basis to rehabilitate those families <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend the minister for clarification <e> <s> while the two amendments concern child-minders they are different <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs will be prepared to speak to the other amendment but they are different <e> <s> does my noble friend wish them to be taken together <e>", "<cs> by whom <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend the minister very much for her explanation <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> perhaps i should say to my noble friend lady gardner of parkes that we are talking of those who are in receipt of supplementary benefit <e> <s> perhaps we have it wrong but as we understand it if they are reimbursed over it counts against their supplementary benefit <e> <s> we may be wrong but that is what we understand perhaps the minister would make that clear <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> as there are discussions taking place i shall wait to see what happens <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord wigoder for so ably and sensitively moving the amendment and i thank the noble and learned lord for his comments <e> <s> i am puzzled about the position of <e>", "<cs> i believe the committee are in some difficulty over this amendment <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that as drafted it is difficult to see how the amendment can be administered <e> <s> what this ties up with is the question of discretionary payments or regulations <e> <s> if it were laid down by regulation for example that in certain circumstances loans were to be given and in other circumstances grants were to be made this would <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> in particular i have in mind the homeless who are living in bed and breakfast accommodation and as has been mentioned by the noble lord lord henderson young people who are coming out of care <e> <s> as it stands at the moment the law under the children and young persons acts cannot help any child who comes out of care at the age of <e> <s> even if they find one unfurnished room which is what these young people usually find they have no means of purchasing a bed or any furniture whatsoever <e> <s> moreover if they are to be given a loan they will never be able to repay it <e> <s> i regret to have to say that various misfortunes stem from this situation and the young people get deeper into debt or into trouble <e> <s> therefore in the light of such cases i support the noble lord lord henderson in this amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i take the point which was made by my noble friend lady macleod <e> <s> i have been out of social work too long to know whether or not all the information is put on <e>", "<cs> i have a working relationship with both statutory and voluntary child care agencies in this country <e> <s> indeed last week i spent four days in birmingham meeting social workers both in the voluntary sector and in the social services and talking to mothers in a very poor inner city area <e> <s> what i knew before was reinforced by what i learned last week that not only should we increase child benefit in line with prices but should go further and try to increase it in line with tax allowances <e>", "<cs> i was going to say that i would read in <e>", "<cs> i shall read what the minister has said in <e>", "<cs> it is wonderful how my noble friend the minister and i agree without my having given her a long description <e> <s> i therefore withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this amendment <e> <s> it hurts to go against my noble and most revered friend lord thorneycroft but i think that on this occasion i must do so <e> <s> my noble friend lord thorneycroft talked about and he reminds me the richer members of the middle band <e> <s> the middle band in many cases need the child benefit as much as perhaps those who have less money in our society <e> <s> the mother really benefits by having something which is her own and therefore i support the amendment from that point of view <e> <s> also regarding family credit may i say to my noble friend the minister that we are not sure how family credit is going to work inasmuch as we have this most peculiar clause a little while later supported by my noble friend ladytrumpington and the noble baroness lady jeger <e> <s> such a thing has never happened before <e> <s> but i would say also to my noble friend lady gardner of parkes that we do not know how family credit is going to work <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend the minister for her sympathetic reply <e> <s> i am a little sad from a practical point of view that as stated in the amendment the cases are not to be prescribed <e> <s> the supplementary benefit offices are not on duty over weekends whereas social service departments are on duty over weekends <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i was beginning to think that i had the lowest possible iq in your lordships house before she said that the numbers had gone wrong <e> <s> this is a very complicated situation and it is very hard on the minister that she should have to go through it all over again <e> <s> i wonder whether she could bear it in mind for the next stage of the bill and whether it could be clarified for us then <e> <s> i still cannot understand whether under her statement the child minder will have a disregard of one-third of the payments received in respect of child minding <e> <s> it will be extremely difficult for my noble friend the minister and if your lordships agree may i ask her whether she will clarify the whole situation for us by writing to us and then raising the matter at the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with the assurance of my noble friend the minister i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take up two points made by the noble lord lord henderson on this amendment <e> <s> first as a director of social services it was part of my role to collect debts <e> <s> it is very expensive collecting debts and i wonder whether the government have recognised exactly what procedure will be involved in the collection of debts from people who have no money <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals remarked on this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am almost speechless <e> <s> may i thank my noble friend the minister for accepting an amendment <e> <s> it gives me great pleasure not to be voting against the government or indeed in this case for the government because they have accepted the amendment <e> <s> i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the question asked by my noble friend lady lane-fox and the fact that donations to charities are rising may i ask what extra resources are being allocated to the charity commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very carefully to the noble lord lord wigoder and the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and i entirely agree with the speeches of both noble lords <e> <s> i look at matters from the point of view of the claimants <e> <s> i would therefore say to the noble and learned lord lord denning that one has to think of how the claimant sees it <e> <s> it is true that sometimes the tribunals have not been as quick and efficient as they might have been but i think that they have grown to be much more efficient <e>", "<cs> my lords in the area of social policies housing health education and unemployment housing policies can positively affect health employment and education <e> <s> there is ample evidence too that many of the unemployed who wish to be in work could move to areas where there is work but for the lack of housing <e> <s> bearing in mind the basic importance of housing may i ask my noble friend the minister a number of questions <e> <s> some arise specifically out of the bill <e> <s> others are connected with housing and planning but are not perhaps specifically mentioned in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether her majestys government have taken any action on the working party report made by the national council of voluntary organisations on malpractices in fund raising <e> <s> if not is that due to the lack of resources of the charity commission <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might ask the noble and learned lord for clarification <e> <s> those of us who under the gypsies act have been involved in setting up gypsy sites through local government have always felt very confused because there is a big <e>", "<cs> or back my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble baroness lady david in this amendment <e> <s> i want to say quite categorically that i agree with the policy of her majestys government of the right to buy <e> <s> also as the noble baroness has said i support to the full the work of the housing associations <e> <s> but i also believe that there must be choice and there must be balance <e> <s> therefore local authorities must have an adequate housing stock <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble baroness lady david on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the noble baroness has put the case very fully <e> <s> perhaps i may first say how grateful she and i were to my noble friend the minister for seeing us and discussing with us the whole question of the new towns <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister agree that we should pay tribute to the volunteer tutors in this country who are helping and giving lessons to those who are illiterate <e> <s> i think that the value of this amounts to the equivalent of million <e> <s> does my noble friend the minister also agree that to pursue this very good policy we should perhaps have more paid organisers for this work <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that positive reply which everyone in this country will be glad to hear <e> <s> does she agree that although in law social services departments are responsible for cases they and they alone cannot carry the full responsibility and must be supported and worked with by education departments the police health departments and voluntary organisations <e> <s> does my noble friend further agree that the general public both wish and need to help <e> <s> would she think it wise for meetings to be held throughout the country and perhaps in every county where the general public can be informed of the problem and can be told where to refer cases and how to help neighbours in trouble and in need <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether her majestys government and the department of education and science regard dyslexia as a separate condition and do not just include it with an enormous number of other conditions <e> <s> my impression is that it is not recognised as a separate condition and difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords many people concerned with the lives of children will welcome the statement in the gracious speech that family law reform is to be introduced <e> <s> the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack has shown his deep concern for children <e> <s> already children have been safeguarded by the child abduction and custody act which was passed in the last parliamentary year <e> <s> that act was followed by the family law act part one which also dealt with the custody of children <e> <s> we have also passed the law reform parent and child scotland act which was introduced by my noble friend lord selkirk and accepted by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> therefore we know that the noble and learned lord and his department have a deep interest in children <e>", "<cs> my lords i hoped that i would hear that <e> <s> secondly would it not be a positive generous and cost effective act to support the national family conciliation service by giving it resources <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord mean the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham or the right reverend prelate the bishop of london because we have london with us <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this bill which is not easy to read <e> <s> nevertheless it has been presented with great clarity to your lordships house by the noble and learned lord on the woolsack <e> <s> it would be presumptuous of me to tackle questions of law and the matters so ably raised by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale and i shall not do so <e> <s> i propose to concentrate on the feelings emotions and sense of personal justice of the children who are the subject of our debate today <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble and learned lord lord silkin of dulwich <e> <s> the noble lord lord meston regrets that he is unable to be here this afternoon as he is in court <e>", "<cs> since the noble and learned lord lord denning has mentioned my name in his speech i should like to speak to the amendment that he has moved <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that before setting up such a college one ought to consider the effectiveness of the central council for education and training in social work and secondly the national institute for social work at mary ward house <e> <s> cannot these two establishments increase and improve the training of probation officers <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell us the difference in arrears between local authorities and housing associations <e> <s> i understand that housing associations so manage their affairs that they have very little in the way of arrears <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this bill and press her majestys government to give serious and positive consideration to it <e> <s> i thank the noble earl <e> <s> lord halsbury for bringing the bill before your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether her majestys government have been in touch with the national association of counselling which has offices and personnel throughout the country and which could very much assist in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i pay tribute to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for his tenacity in again bringing up in your lordships house the question of charities <e> <s> much of what i have to say underlines what the noble lord said and i too should like to pay tribute to the charity commission the staff and the charity commissioner mr peach who rightly was honoured last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i must offer my credentials in view of the fact that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton asked a rhetorical question which of us on this side knew anything about local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not been elected to local government <e> <s> i have worked in local government as a junior as a middle manager and as a chief officer <e> <s> therefore i speak to your lordships house today with very deep feeling as one who has been an officer in local government <e> <s> like many noble lords i think we would be the poorer without good local government <e> <s> i believe profoundly in local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to ask the noble and learned lord lord denning one question what is truth <e> <s> the noble lord lord meston has mentioned the fact that during the time that artificial insemination has taken place nevertheless sexual intercourse continues between husband and wife <e> <s> those of us who have dealt with adoption meet a very extraordinary situation <e> <s> a husband and wife who have not been able to have children come to an adoption society and ask to adopt a child <e> <s> one goes through all the procedures for adoption and a child is placed for adoption <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all be very grateful to the noble viscount for raising this subject <e> <s> it is a subject which is rarely discussed in your lordships house yet it is one which is of deep significance in the country today <e> <s> therefore it is with some slight regret that i have to say that as the second speaker i shall approach it from a completely different angle leaving other speakers including the noble baronesses lady nicol and lady seear who know more about industry and commerce to comment on that aspect <e> <s> i wish to approach the problem from the point of view of the care of children which enables married women to work <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very encouraging reply <e> <s> the national childrens home the all-party parliamentary group for children and the nspcc pay tribute to the government for supporting this part of the criminal justice bill <e> <s> is there any possibility of the government looking into the position of children giving evidence by video at the time or directly after the incident has happened and that video being used in court <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether it is likely that the government will have completed their investigative inquiry with regard to video-taped interviews before the criminal justice bill comes to this house or will it be after <e>", "<cs> my lords is it likely that the london residuary body will produce a report of its work since it was set up so that we can know exactly the position not only with hampstead heath but with other matters as well <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend the minister forgive me if i repeat a question i asked in the house last week <e> <s> has the work of the residuary body and of the boroughs been monitored over the past months and are there reports available that we might see <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the amendments but i shall not go into them in detail at this late hour because the points have been very well made <e> <s> however i shall just make two points <e> <s> first the noble lord lord campbell of alloway read out a letter from the noble lord lord henderson of brompton in which he said that it was not politically possible for a means-tested system to be used <e> <s> while i do not like means-tested systems nevertheless in the social fund of the social security act such a system is used <e> <s> therefore it is politically possible <e>", "<cs> my lords with others i congratulate the noble lord lord irvine on his maiden speech <e> <s> i trust that he will support the amendments that i hope to move and then i know that there will be a chance of getting them through <e> <s> i am sure that the minister will also support them <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some diffidence that i intervene in this debate <e> <s> i propose to take trade unions down to the local level dealing with local trade union members <e> <s> i shall deal with the position of those local level employed trade union members as touched upon by my noble friend lord beloff <e> <s> from the outset i make clear that even now i am a trade union member and i have been president of my local trade union in oxford <e> <s> i therefore wish to speak not on high politics not on high law but on the ordinary person at the grass roots <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that tribute should be paid to the salvation army for the absolutely excellent bureau which it runs for tracing people particularly children who have disappeared <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh in his introduction to this debate for which we are very grateful invited us to speak on our own sectors of interest <e> <s> i shall seek to speak today on the training and education of social workers

should not have allegations comments or information about them on files which is not true and which they have no way of countering <e>", "<cs> my lords in the gracious speech it is stated <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also thank the minister for the statement <e> <s> will he agree that there are two issues the here and now and the future <e> <s> as regards here and now the statement states very clearly what is happening and that there is to be the inquiry and consideration of the law in the next session <e> <s> i look back to the time in when denis oneil died in a foster home and the curtis committee was set up <e> <s> i suggest that besides looking at the here and now situation which must be dealt with here and now we should also look at much broader issues and the framework under which child care is carried out in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that we and particularly the press should refrain from making accusations in any direction until the reports are published and until we know the facts <e> <s> i do not think that we should cast aspersions in any direction <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that when the individual inquiries into this case and previous cases for which everyone is grateful have been carried out it would be a good idea to look at the overall structure of child care services which would include the juvenile

some juvenile courts in this country the improvements in the way juvenile justice is administered is uneven through the country <e> <s> that is not to say that the magistrates are not doing their work well but the problem is the way that the courts are run <e> <s> to my certain knowledge the courts do not and cannot in many cases involve the parents in the way that is done in scotland <e>", "<cs> first i should like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for explaining very carefully and in his very lucid way his view with regard to this amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may also thank all those who have spoken both for and against but mostly of course for <e>", "<cs> nevertheless i have not held high office of state but i do from the grass roots part of this bill understand what people want and need in this country <e> <s> i am very grateful to the right honourable lady the prime minister who brought me into this house who made the recommendation that <e>", "<cs> no i shall leave the matter there <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment and i should like to ask some questions <e> <s> looking at the number of citizens advice bureaux in the country and at the map i understand that the whole country is not covered by citizens advice bureaux by legal centres or by money centres which give a great service <e> <s> therefore perhaps i may ask my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor whether the board will carry out a survey throughout the country <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say first of all from the point of view of the citizens advice bureaux being part of the boards responsibility that the citizens advice bureaux as i understand it do far wider work than give only legal advice to people <e> <s> therefore they could not be exclusively the responsibility of the board <e> <s> nevertheless having said that they give the most enormous amount of legal advice and legal consultation and counselling to people which saves legal aid <e> <s> with regard to the conciliation service the service is of course entirely separate from both legal centres and the cab but nevertheless they also give a service which saves legal aid to an enormous degree <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat confused over this amendment <e> <s> with regard to law advice centres i quite understand the point of view of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> as regards advice centres if by that is meant citizens advice centres people of all sorts and conditions go into them for advice over a wide range of subjects <e> <s> honesty compels me to say though i would like to say something different that people of means go into citizens advice centres because very often particularly in country areas they are the only places where they can receive advice <e>", "<cs> my lords on two counts i thank the noble lord lord ross of newport first for his maiden speech secondly i was director of the social services when he worked towards the moving of housing of the homeless from the social services to housing <e> <s> for that i was deeply grateful <e> <s> inevitably we shall all cover some of the same points <e>", "<cs> my lords i also pay tribute to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for initiating this debate and who better as a former <e>", "<cs> i was born in south africa <e> <s> i abhor apartheid <e> <s> i wish to make absolutely clear that i know what it means for i have experienced it <e> <s> secondly i have been a chief officer in a local authority <e> <s> when i was a chief officer it was my role in that authority to serve the people of the area where i worked <e> <s> i was first a childrens officer and then i became director of social services <e> <s> i was responsible for the delinquent the homeless and the difficult children of the city <e> <s> if it served those children well to have oranges from south africa oranges from spain or oranges from the south of france i chose the best oranges because i was responsible for giving the best service to the people in my area <e>", "<cs> i shall not go into the case again because it has been put by the noble baroness lady lockwood but i should like to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that encouraging answer <e> <s> we very much hope that the response will be in the affirmative for a grant for the training of social workers <e> <s> does the minister agree that throughout the country it is not fully appreciated that social workers at the moment only receive one to two years training and that it is the only profession in the country which only has one to two years training <e> <s> all other professions have three years <e> <s> does not the minister agree that social workers have a heavy burden to bear in the work that they do <e>", "<cs> my lords is the cost of these inquiries fully appreciated <e> <s> i understand that the inquiry in cleveland which i know covers more than just the social workers will cost about million <e> <s> if there had been fully trained social workers the other inquiries which have had to be undertaken need not really have taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords is it right that the review will cover not only costs but the terms of reference for work done by different bands of nurses <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who is not trained in the law but a lay person who has had to work with the law perhaps i may ask two questions on matters which puzzle me very much <e> <s> what other profession has written into a bill its terms of payment <e> <s> if those are written into a bill for the legal profession then all the other professions architects and so on will take this as a precedent and will want their terms of payment written into an act of parliament <e> <s> where would we be <e> <s> it would be a most awkward situation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> because it is very difficult to get reliable home helps and they must be reliable i think i am right in saying that the authorities have now targeted home helps on people who need personal care rather than domestic help <e> <s> the minister will correct me if i am wrong <e> <s> others can do domestic work but these people need home helps for personal care <e> <s> in my area that is what is happening <e>", "<cs> i must give my own front bench a fearful shock and say that i do not support the motion against this clause <e> <s> indeed i was so worried about this part of the bill that i spent a whole day at a jobcentre watching as young people entered and left it <e> <s> of those young people who came in and studied the jobs on the boards a proportion of them said not for us <e> <s> i asked them how they felt about the yts <e> <s> they said that they knew all about it but would much rather draw their benefits <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am deeply concerned about the social fund and support the noble lord lord banks in that we must know who has been turned down and to whom grants are being given <e> <s> it also requires a little further research as to what happens to those people who have been refused a grant otherwise the scheme will not be cost-effective <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down as a matter of information if the adjudication officer turns down a claim what right of appeal has the claimant against him <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will write to me <e>", "<cs> where does the social security appeals tribunal sit <e>", "<cs> surely this could be resolved by guidelines <e> <s> if a fund has been set up like the aberfan fund or say a lifeboat fund i can quite see that one would go to that fund before going to social security <e> <s> i think that that is what people would prefer <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord ennals that there should be guidelines for social fund adjudication officers <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady turner has put the case so well and i should like to support her in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i usually agree with my noble friend lord beloff but in this case i must disagree with him <e> <s> i should like to give one example to illustrate why i do so <e> <s> i am no cleopatra and certainly not a boadicea and i am nothing like as intelligent as the prime minister but some years ago i applied for a job and was very thrilled because the employers sent for me first <e> <s> i thought i had the job <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the noble lords lord allen of abbeydale and lord mcgregor of durris i wish to thank the noble and learned lord on the woolsack for his amendment <e> <s> it is straightforward and will be understood by people using legal aid and organisations such as the law centres and citizens advice bureaux <e> <s> it will help them realise what the bill is for <e> <s> we are grateful to have this purpose clause set out by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i have not had time to discuss with my noble friends the alteration put forward by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> however it seems to me that there is not much between the amendments <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for the word framework and we are happy with it <e>", "<cs> my lords as an ex-childrens officer and speaking also for the voluntary organisations and for the director of social services i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support amendments nos <e> <s> and and to say how much the committee is appreciated by all the voluntary organisations particularly the national consumer council and the citizens advice bureau <e> <s> the committee is looked upon very much as an independent body to whom one can apply <e> <s> although the legal aid board will i am sure do its work extremely well it is good at any rate to start with to have a guarder of the guardians <e>", "<cs> my lords taking up a point raised by the noble lords lord mellish and lord hylton does the minister not agree that the <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that to achieve good community care there must be a sound relationship between health and social services <e> <s> does he agree that the training of social workers is vitally important <e> <s> will more money be available for the training of social workers <e>", "<cs> i rise quickly to my feet to say that under those circumstances i shall reconsider the matter discuss it and take legal advice <e> <s> i am very grateful to my noble friend and to the noble baroness lady seear as well as the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister indicate what financial help is given to the charitable organisations which are invited to distribute the food <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming this amendment i should nevertheless like to ask my noble friend the minister whether he does not agree that a more global view should be taken of the situation <e> <s> if the report is made within the social security framework it might look quite different from a report that is made in conjunction with other departments notably the social services <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended to speak to amendment no <e> <s> but perhaps it would be relevant to the present issue if i spoke now <e> <s> i should like to pursue a point that i raised earlier <e> <s> if the fund does run out or if the case is turned down even if funds have not run out will the social fund officer be working closely with the social services and the charities so that a person does not suffer and redound on to the budget of some other organisaton <e> <s> that question is worrying me a great deal and i think it must also be worrying the social services who at present are in effect cash limited <e> <s> i should be most grateful if my noble friend the minister could assist me in this respect <e> <s> i think the question really arises under amendment no <e> <s> but it also features in this one <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether there has been any research or any survey carried out into the exact effect of pornographic literature films and books upon children <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what my noble friend has said can she give an assurance that there will not be a gap between the time that ilea gives up and the local authorities take over when there is no money for the youth clubs and youth leaders <e> <s> i regret to have to say that youth leaders are already leaving the london youth service because of the lack of security <e> <s> bearing in mind that a number of the clubs have children from different boroughs will there be disagreement among the boroughs as to who should pay for the clubs <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that there is a committee sitting in the house of commons looking into education of children under and that the department of health and social security has given money to the national childrens bureau to look into the same subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to see that the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson has returned to his place <e> <s> i wonder whether i may read to your lordships i hope i shall be forgiven for so doing page of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that if i had thought that it was injudicious i should have asked myself what i should do <e> <s> should i have gone to the noble and learned lord lord brightman and said i cannot now sit on your committee <e> <s> or should i have gone to the chief whip and said i wish to withdraw <e> <s> i took neither course of action nor did any other member of the committee <e> <s> i submit that we were right to continue with it in the interests of all those who went to such great trouble to give their evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise as i have put my name to this amendment and i wish to make two points <e> <s> even if this provision is in another bill as the noble lord lord mccarthy and the noble baroness lady seear said the last time why should people have to look to another bill when it could so easily be in this bill <e> <s> secondly i fear that having this provision in another bill could lead to court cases in order to prove that it applied to this bill <e> <s> that would be most unreasonable <e> <s> therefore i support my noble friend lady lane-fox <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that answer <e> <s> however is he aware that the courts the probation service social workers and the families themselves will be disappointed and distressed taking into account that in there was a report from a committee in the house of commons in a consultation paper and in the white paper <e> <s> if the ministers reply means that there is insufficient parliamentary time when will we have some legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not like music <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this bill but perhaps i may at this late hour speak briefly on five aspects where i believe amendments are required <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord hunter for providing this opportunity to bring before your lordships house the report <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord <e> <s> these amendments are all grouped together and i shall later move amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> perhaps i may underline what the noble lord said because i have dealt a great deal with handicapped children young people and students <e> <s> one child said to me one day oh miss arent people silly <e> <s> they think i am silly <e> <s> it is the tendency of everybody to think of a handicapped person as not being mentally able <e> <s> i was talking to a handicapped doctor the other day and he told me that he had the greatest difficulty getting through his course because everybody thought he was mentally backward <e> <s> that is the tendency in schools colleges and universities <e> <s> the one thing that handicapped people do not need is to be made doubly handicapped by those who are dealing with them <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend the minister answer a small query <e> <s> i have tabled amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> do i speak to them together as they have been grouped together or do i speak to them individually as we come to them <e>", "<cs> in that case i have no option but to speak to all the amendments <e> <s> however they are individual different amendments which cannot be spoken to generally <e> <s> and there are a great number of them <e> <s> i cannot speak to one alone <e> <s> looking at the groupings amendment no <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may thank the noble baroness for dealing with all the amendments at the same time <e> <s> however i have found it somewhat confusing <e> <s> i am due to move six amendments with two of which as i understand it the noble baroness will not agree <e> <s> i therefore think that when we come to those amendments it will be wisest for me to withdraw them <e> <s> i shall then consider them and perhaps bring them back at report stage <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> tabled in my name is among this group of amendments <e> <s> i shall not repeat them because all the subjects have been mentioned by the noble baroness lady blackstone the noble lord lord kilmarnock and other members <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord sandford that one does not wish to continue to repeat the various subjects <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend particularly in regard to what she has said about personal and social education <e> <s> there was the other arm of the amendment dealing with the practical side of home economics but at this late hour i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have spoken to my noble friend the chief whip <e> <s> i spoke to eight amendments on tuesday and the minister replied but i did not move them <e> <s> i shall move them today withdraw them and bring them back at report stage <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> falls within this group <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord ritchie and the noble baroness lady david for what they have said by way of introduction to the debate <e> <s> i am particularly interested in children with a difficult home background deprived children those with special educational needs and the very bright children <e> <s> as has already been said by the noble lord and the noble baroness it is difficult to know what is the governments response to the black report <e> <s> it is difficult to know what to recommend until we know what the government are thinking and how they will implement the report <e>", "<cs> speaking to amendment no <e> <s> may i follow the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> what is in the bill does not accord with what my noble friend has so ably said <e> <s> this is the problem that we face <e> <s> we have heard the debate it will appear in <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may have some clarification from the chair <e> <s> has the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee moved amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we shall come to amendment no <e> <s> later <e> <s> are the amendments being moved individually or <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask for an explanation about this <e> <s> as i remember it we did not accept this amendment at the last stage <e> <s> if i am right we had a debate on all the amendments and my noble friend the minister spoke on them but we did not however agree to each of them individually <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister for her encouraging words <e> <s> i am bound to say two things <e> <s> first it is eight years since the education act was passed <e> <s> it is very sad that we have progressed so little over those eight years in helping children with special educational needs in our schools that being the intention of the act <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> f moved by the noble baroness lady seear is a paving amendment to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> therefore i should like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment but nevertheless i have to sound a note of warning <e> <s> all my working life i have tried to use schools for community purposes for clubs and for all types of outside activities but one is always up against the caretakers <e> <s> therefore unless we take into account the fact that more money must be paid out to a deputy caretaker we shall never have the use of the schools <e> <s> that factor has always stood in the way <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend the minister for his reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> parents of handicapped children must learn to be mature against fearful odds <e> <s> they need to feel like other parents <e> <s> if their rights are different from those of other parents then they are diminished <e> <s> i support this amendment because it brings the parents of children who have special educational needs into line with the parents of other children <e>", "<cs> i agree with the minister to this extent it will not be the ordinary thing for people to ask to opt back into the state system <e> <s> however there are certain circumstances which might make it advisable and wise giving freedom to parents and governors and indeed to children <e> <s> it would be a pity not to write into the bill the mechanism by which people can opt back to the state system although i realise that such a course of action would not be undertaken often <e>", "<cs> may i ask the right reverend prelate why it cannot appear in its present form as recommended by the proposers of the amendment <e>", "<cs> collective christian worship <e>", "<cs> perhaps the right reverend prelate will allow me to intervene <e> <s> on the education welfare service his information and mine vary slightly <e> <s> i am in touch with a school in one of the worst boroughs in london which has not had a visit from an education welfare officer since last year and which has a high delinquency and truancy rate <e>", "<cs> i have put my name to this amendment and i am most grateful to the noble lord for allowing me to speak <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord on what he bases those statements <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong the debate but the noble lord said that people on this side of the committee approved of that <e> <s> we do not <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment i ask my noble friend the minister for some advice <e> <s> who is to collect the money <e> <s> members of the committee have referred to the letter from the salvation army on the issue of collection <e> <s> i refer to the whole sphere of hostels the simon hostel the church army hostels the salvation army hostels the shelters for battered wives <e> <s> all of those organisations take in people who are in trouble for a short or longer time <e> <s> at the time when they are taken in they are insecure and aggressive <e> <s> those of us who have worked with such vulnerable people know how very difficult it is to establish a relationship with them <e> <s> and until you establish a relationship with them you cannot possibly make any effort to rehabilitate them <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak from the point of view of local authorities which have already been mentioned by the noble lord lord ross of newport <e> <s> under the chronically sick and disabled persons act local authorities have a statutory duty toward the disabled <e> <s> at the moment it is very difficult to carry out those statutory duties because of the cutback in resources to local authorities <e> <s> a number of local authority social services departments are trying to carry out their statutory duties by way of volunteers <e> <s> the csvs are helping local authorities to carry out their statutory duties without extra cost to the local authorities <e> <s> if the charities think that they will have to subsidise the volunteers the local authorities will feel the same and the resources will not allow for that <e> <s> the noble lord may agree <e> <s> i therefore hope that the minister will take this into account <e>", "<cs> i am deeply grateful to my noble friend for saying that he will take this back <e>", "<cs> members of the committee will remember that a question was asked about the position of scientologists and moonies <e> <s> it was <e>", "<cs> may i take up a point that the noble lord has just made <e> <s> as a social worker i know that the members of the british association of social workers working in local authorities are seriously concerned that they may be compelled to jeopardise the ethical principle that they are required to uphold namely that information clearly entrusted for one purpose should not be used for another without <e>", "<cs> may i seek further clarification from my noble friend in regard to social workers <e> <s> he generously said that there was certain information of a sensitive nature in the social service departments of local authorities which would be safeguarded <e> <s> however did i understand him to say that names and addresses would be required <e> <s> that presents difficulties <e> <s> social workers deal with homeless families <e> <s> they deal with women who have left their families for one reason or another or left their husbands because of cruelty and neglect <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say what a complicated situation this is because day centres which are supposed to be just for the day nevertheless in some cases provide beds for some people who cannot go home at night <e> <s> i suppose that those people are registered at home <e> <s> day centres play a dual role of caring during the day and in some instances at night but not always for the same person every night <e> <s> therefore day centres such as those described by the noble lord lord morton of shuna present a very complicated problem <e>", "<cs> i wish to make three points <e> <s> first the latest award to the nurses has lifted their morale <e> <s> this was one of the most important factors in project <e> <s> if the bill goes through as it stands at the moment their morale is going to decline again <e> <s> the nurses i have spoken to feel that this bill is diminishing their profession just at the very moment when we are trying to raise professional standards and morale <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just make a comment and not ask a question <e> <s> i am fearful that if the amendment is not accepted an enormous number of children will have to be taken into care <e> <s> it costs roughly a year when a child goes into care <e> <s> a different department of the local authority will pay out a year because a woman has not paid her supplementary benefit attachment of earnings order <e> <s> we are fearful that that will happen <e> <s> it will mean the break-up of family life and will lead to children not having a home <e> <s> that in turn will have tremendous repercussions right the way through childrens lives and it will not be cost-effective for society as a whole <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up the point made by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones about alternatives <e> <s> as regards juvenile justice in the last criminal justice bill we asked that no one should be committed to custodial care until every other line available had been tried <e> <s> i realise that there has to be an ultimate sanction <e> <s> i understand my <e>", "<cs> i admitted that there had to be an ultimate deterrent but i said that everything else should be tried first <e> <s> and that requirement is not written into the bill <e> <s> we decided in this place on an earlier bill that the courts should look at everything else before they looked at prison <e> <s> if that requirement were to be written into the bill many of us would be much happier <e>", "<cs> knowing the governments support of the charitable and voluntary sector in our society i have put my name to this amendment <e> <s> i think it would be wise for all of us to hear what the minister has to say as i cannot believe that great thought has not been given to the matter <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up a point made by my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> i am sure that local authorities will certainly support charity shops if they serve the people of the area in which that shop is located <e> <s> but there are many charities for instance oxfam that do not directly help people of a particular area but help people in an overall global area <e> <s> i know that the noble baroness lady ryder of warsaw has shops in places where she does not have a home but that nevertheless those shops do support homes in other areas <e> <s> i fear that local authorities will help those charities that are helping their own ratepayers but that they will find it a little difficult to help those charities which are global <e> <s> therefore i take up the point made by the noble lord lord renton and support it <e>", "<cs> i am involved in a large simon community and also a church army hostel for the homeless where people come in for a night sometimes for only half a day and perhaps for two days <e> <s> as the noble lord lord stallard said assessment of such people is extraordinarily difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for bringing forward this matter today <e> <s> i am grateful for two reasons first because of the problem itself and secondly because on the last occasion i saw the late lord butler of saffron walden before he died he said to me when will they implement my report <e> <s> that was a long time ago and the report has not been implemented <e> <s> i have a deep feeling of sympathy both for prison officers and for the police <e> <s> we are asking prison officers and the police to do a job for which they are not trained in which they are not experienced and which is not their job <e> <s> we should not ask them to look after the mentally disturbed and mentally ill prisoners whether on remand or in prison <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask a question <e> <s> we have talked about bed and breakfast in terms of the tourist trade but what about bed and breakfast for homeless families <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble lord lord hayter <e> <s> as he has said residual rating was originally to apply to all authorities in england and wales <e> <s> then as he went on to say it was to apply to london authorities <e> <s> now it is just and of those four have been removed today <e>", "<cs> before we take a decision perhaps i may ask for some help from the minister <e> <s> we all want the payers to be cushioned so far as possible <e> <s> however we differ on our figures <e> <s> is the minister convinced by the figures that he has used <e> <s> a number of us have used figures that we have received from local authorities <e> <s> ought we not to look into this more carefully before we make a final decision <e> <s> is he convinced that the figures he has given are absolutely correct <e> <s> does he not think that we ought to consider them again <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord carter <e> <s> i realise that both the education act and this bill should apply to all children <e> <s> it may be said by the minister that the amendment is not necessary for that reason <e> <s> however we must look at history and experience <e> <s> unfortunately we must face frankly that since the act was passed it has been well implemented in some areas in some areas it has not been implemented at all and in some areas it has been badly implemented <e> <s> for that reason we ask for the word all to be put on the face of the bill in order to reinforce what is contained in the act and what we know is intended to be the effect of this bill <e> <s> we ask for that because we know that to date the act has not been fully implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to all those noble lords who have spoken to this amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble lord lord carlisle that we did not recommend in amendment no <e> <s> that it should be either in the core curriculum or a foundation subject <e> <s> the point of amendments nos <e> <s> and was to argue that there are so many boys girls and parents who want the subject home economics and the allied subject of personal and social education and life skills that if we believe that this is a bill for children and their parents that subject ought to be available to be taken in the schools should it be so wished <e> <s> from discussions during the committee stage of the bill we realised that it would not be a core or foundation subject but for it not to be available in the schools so that parents and children can ask for it would we think be a great mistake <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the chief whip this <e> <s> if we are meeting on friday morning at oclock does it mean that on thursday rd june we shall finish at pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment on three counts <e> <s> first the education act has been in existence for some time but we must frankly admit that it has not been fully implemented throughout the country <e> <s> it is good or partially good in some parts of the country bad in others <e> <s> many schools have needed advice and help which they have been unable to obtain or which has not reached them <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i agree that resources are very important <e> <s> but the lack of knowledge is abysmal <e> <s> i recently visited a school which admitted a spina bifida child without having any conception or idea of what was needed for such a child <e> <s> that story can be repeated time and time again throughout the country <e> <s> i believe that if we were to have knowledge experience and advice then the resources would come in some way <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support this amendment on three counts <e> <s> first of all it is the background and one of the beliefs underlying this bill that there should be parental responsibility <e> <s> i think it is very important in this area that parents should be consulted <e> <s> secondly those of us who have dealt with children with special educational needs know that there are some teachers who are absolutely excellent with the children but who in certain cases have become over-involved <e> <s> this always happens in the area of the handicapped as i think the noble baroness would agree <e> <s> therefore just to rely entirely on the teacher without it being a teacher-parent decision is very unwise the wrong thing could be done <e> <s> thirdly for the sake of the child i believe there has to be consultation with the parent because the child must feel part of the family <e> <s> on these three counts therefore i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down perhaps i may ask him for clarification <e> <s> he said that the head teacher must be able to move quickly <e> <s> why quickly <e> <s> in a situation like this there needs to be a considered judgment <e> <s> one of the important matters is that the head teacher should seek other advice particularly about the childs home <e> <s> perhaps i may just cite the case of one severely deaf child <e> <s> it was thought by the school that the child should be educated in a deaf class in one of the schools <e> <s> this was decided on without knowing that the child was an illegitimate child and that there were <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have spoken in support of the amendment <e> <s> children with special education needs would be deeply grateful if they were able to express their gratitude <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i must confess that i had not read the guidance published on th june about which she spoke <e> <s> i am not clear about the financial arrangements <e> <s> when a child suffering from spina bifida goes to school a great deal of money will need to be spent on the school to make it possible for the child to attend <e> <s> does the guidance lay down that the money will be available to alter a school for such a child <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may congratulate her majestys government on bringing out the circular and the formula which we shall read with the greatest interest <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say very briefly that both the department of education and science and the department of health and social security have given money to finance a research unit at the national childrens bureau that is studying the needs of children under five <e> <s> i believe that the intention of her majestys government in giving that money is to assess what kind of nursery training and facilities are needed <e> <s> that is being looked into and research is being carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord ritchie for having supported the amendment <e> <s> i thank the minister for her explanation <e> <s> the cause of worry is that in the letter which she so kindly wrote to me she said <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have spoken in this debate and for their support <e> <s> if a school is keen enough to opt out then for at least five years it will not want to opt back <e> <s> i maintain that there will not be politicisation as suggested by my noble friend lady carnegy <e> <s> there will not be edging and pushing and awkward situations arising at the meetings of governors as suggested by my noble friend lord beloff <e> <s> i am suggesting that circumstances may change for reasons which have nothing to do with the success of the school or with politicisation <e> <s> however the government have taken a certain stand and i do not propose to divide the house <e> <s> i hope that when governors and parents opt out of the system it will be made clear to them that they cannot opt back in again <e> <s> i believe that they should know where they stand <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there are certain legal difficulties involved <e> <s> i should have thought that the law is quite clear as to who is responsible for a child except in one direction namely the director of social services <e> <s> if a child is in care under the children act it is the parents responsibility and not that of the director of social services <e> <s> on the other hand if the child is in care under a care order obtained through the courts then the child is the responsibility of the director of social services <e> <s> therefore it would be most helpful to have the matter clarified <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i simply said that the keeping of records was putting a great burden on teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all members of the house who have spoken in support of the amendment <e> <s> first i believe that it is a very serious matter with far-reaching effects it not only concerns education <e> <s> it means that the children who play truant do not establish a way of work and therefore as mentioned by the noble lord lord dormand of easington they ultimately become homeless without work <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this amendment and to make two points <e> <s> first the act has been in being for seven years but it has not been implemented throughout the country <e> <s> it would not be necessary to move such an amendment if it were not for the fact that the act is not being implemented throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment from a different point of view <e> <s> it is that of the children who are not fitting in at home or into their big school <e> <s> if one is not careful a number of such children ultimately come before the court for committing offences or for non-school attendance <e> <s> transfer to a small school of this type often prevents them committing offences and coming into care <e> <s> on many occasions i have used such schools with gratitude <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> it has been so ably put by my noble friend lady darcy de knayth that i think it needs no further expansion <e> <s> however i should like to draw your lordships attention to the fact that if <e>", "<cs> my lords on rd may i was one of the people who spoke about peoples inability to pay and i forecast that our prison population would be increased <e> <s> i wonder whether i too may ask my noble friend the minister three questions <e> <s> the first is the same as that posed by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble lord lord harris has the home secretary been consulted <e> <s> those of us who work in the penal system have it enjoined upon us day by day to keep people out of prison and to find alternative means of dealing with the situation <e> <s> i am not saying that we should excuse people for not paying their dues but i am saying that this is not the way to deal with those who do not pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not repeat what has been so wonderfully said by other speakers <e> <s> i rise to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend lord sandford and the noble lord lord hayter <e> <s> i wish to take up the point about the charity shops which has already been taken up by the noble lord lord hayter <e> <s> first there are volunteers serving in oxfam shops <e> <s> barnardos with which i am associated has an enormous number of shops up and down the country <e> <s> those volunteers do a magnificent job <e> <s> as has been said they work for the people who need help from those societies <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down if he intends further to consider will he be discussing with his noble friend the secretary of state in the department of health and social security what will happen perhaps not to so many now but to the people who will not be able to be cared for by lady ryders foundation dr barnardos and others who will have to be looked after by the department of health and social security or the social services department <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend the minister replies i wonder whether he can tell me whether his department has consulted the dhss <e> <s> if the amendment moved by the noble lord lord allen does not go through a number of people as i know from personal experience will go into residential care <e> <s> it is difficult to obtain residential care at the moment <e> <s> it is expensive <e> <s> the local authorities do not have the accommodation and therefore it will be a disaster for the local authorities and the dhss <e> <s> have the two ministries conferred on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords my colleague social workers throughout the country will welcome the outstanding report made by an outstanding judge <e> <s> i appreciate that my noble friend the minister cannot elaborate too much on the bill which will have to be in the queens speech therefore he is in some difficulty <e> <s> but having read carefully the white paper on which we hope the bill will be based i should like to say first that we welcome the whole question of consolidating the acts of parliament relating to families and children which will make for clarity and consistency <e> <s> we welcome the recommendations in the white paper on the rights of parents which we hope will figure in the bill <e> <s> we would also welcome in the bill the recommendations with regard to the welfare of children <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said all that i wish to say <e> <s> i want to underline that i hope that the government will understand the whole position with regard to training and not just with regard to training in one area <e>", "<cs> my lords in his clear presentation of the bill to the house the minister said that he would listen to what was said by your lordships and that he would be prepared to consider any recommendations which were made <e> <s> during our consideration of the local government finance bill the minister listened and made many concessions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> and to seek the ministers statements on how it is to be interpreted <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mcintosh said the work of the social services is very sensitive and most vulnerable <e> <s> the social services deal with mental health the elderly the physically impaired <e> <s> children young persons with their families and the homeless <e>", "<cs> when the minister replies perhaps he will explain to me the housing homeless persons act <e> <s> when i administered that act the local authority was under a duty to house homeless families in the way that suited that area the best <e> <s> does this not now apply or does it not apply in country areas <e> <s> i had thought that every local authority must by law under the housing homeless persons act house people who are homeless through no fault of their own <e> <s> i should be very glad of clarification of that <e>", "<cs> yes it is right as i understand it but if the local authority takes a long time one two or three years to supply the accommodation for that family they will remain in whatever accommodation has been found for them <e> <s> we shall come to an amendment later which concerns bed and breakfast <e> <s> this is why so many people are in bed and breakfast accommodation for so long they have not been offered accommodation by the local authority <e>", "<cs> the situation in the country as a whole must have been uneven <e> <s> that is the impression i gained from what the noble lord said <e> <s> certainly in my authority and in the authorities with which i worked there was co-operation between the two departments <e>", "<cs> i ask my noble friend to look sympatheticaly on the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all who have spoken to this amendment <e> <s> i fully appreciate that my noble friend is well aware of how serious is the situation <e> <s> the consultation paper itself says that currently about management orders are made each year and that the number of houses in multiple occupation which are in poor condition as the departments research has shown far exceeds that figure <e> <s> clearly the research department within the ministers department is well aware of the seriousness of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend the minister for that reply may i ask what instructions and guidance have been given to the lord great chamberlain to our much respected black rod and to the doorkeepers who serve us so well likewise the police in the event of it landing on westminster <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask a question <e> <s> i am not clear on the situation <e> <s> would it not be easier for the local authorities to deal with the matter rather than the court <e> <s> is that the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords it hardly needs me to rise to support my noble friend the minister as the noble lord lord mcintosh agrees with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however i wish to make one or two points <e> <s> first the housing corporation may appoint a local authority to act as its agent but not must <e> <s> therefore there is an element of choice <e> <s> secondly there has always been a close relationship between <e>", "<cs> my lords again we must thank the noble earl <e> <s> lord longford <e> <s> for bringing this matter before your lordships house <e> <s> we must admire his persistency in doing this <e> <s> i cannot remember exactly how many times he has done so but i believe it is a number of times <e> <s> we congratulate him and we are also grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord hylton <e> <s> i have just come back from northern ireland <e> <s> i support everything that he has said particularly his comments about orders in council and particularly about work with children under five as i visited several such projects <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said by all noble lords who have spoken we are deeply grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his very clear summary of the bill <e> <s> that was very helpful to us all <e>", "<cs> i understand the reason for putting forward the amendment but like the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale and other noble lords i do not agree with it <e> <s> as my noble friend lord renton has said the bill advises the court to have regard to <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that i absolutely support the remarks made by my noble friend because i think that in the cleveland case it was an emergency and it was at the time of that emergency that things went wrong <e> <s> however i equally see the point made by the noble and learned lord that a fuller report is needed when the case comes before the court <e>", "<cs> very difficult circumstances can arise <e> <s> those who have worked in the child care field know that when parents go abroad and ask somebody else to look after their children and then do not send the money there are real difficulties <e> <s> if this clause goes in one will know exactly who is financially responsible <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord will correct me if i am wrong when i say that they may have surrendered the day-to-day care of the children but they have not surrendered the responsibility <e> <s> as one who worked in oxford i know that there were a number of dons who would do research for a year in another country <e> <s> they would ask an aunt or an uncle or even foster-carers to look after the children and they would be responsible for paying for them <e> <s> therefore the foster-parents had the care of the children but the parents had not surrendered responsibility <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment on two grounds <e> <s> there is a growing cooperation and partnership between the voluntary and statutory sector <e> <s> an enormous number of local authorities are using voluntary bodies not only the nspcc but others as the noble lord lord hylton said <e> <s> therefore the work that they are doing with the family and the knowledge that they have of the family and of the child are of inestimable value to the court <e>", "<cs> may i say that it is essential to go through the local authority <e> <s> the local authority may be dealing with another child in the family and unless it is channelled through one avenue and it is known to the local authority that a voluntary organisation is going to give a report there may be two organisations working within the same family one not knowing about the other <e>", "<cs> as one who has had to make reports to the court on children may i say that one did use hearsay but on only two conditions first that one consulted with the person concerned and obtained permission to put it in the report and secondly that the person would be available if the court called him or her <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether maladjusted and emotionally disturbed children fall into the category that we are talking about <e> <s> as a governor of two schools for maladjusted children we have had applications from london boroughs for london children because it is said that schools are closing in the inner london area <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord lord meston a question <e> <s> if the child is to have a fixed home which is very understandable does the noble lord not also think that it ought to be laid down when the other parent can he visited <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask for further clarification from the noble lord lord meston <e> <s> i have several cases where children spend the week with one parent and the weekend with another parent <e> <s> the brothers and sisters do the same so they are moving together <e> <s> but in fact they have two homes <e> <s> how would this amendment fit in with that situation <e>", "<cs> i understand and agree with the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones i am not sure about the mechanics of it <e> <s> i too ask why the official solicitor should deal with the child and why it should not be the magistrates court or the county court <e> <s> i am not sure how the arrangements will be managed <e> <s> if a case comes to the local authoritys care through the magistrates court i believe that the magistrates court should deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> i agree with all that the noble baroness lady david said <e> <s> i wish to ask just two questions <e> <s> first however i support what the noble lady lady kin loss said as regards what is meant by in need <e> <s> it can be interpreted in many ways <e> <s> i see that it will be difficult to put those words all the way through the bill as it will to put in the phrase of a good parent <e> <s> nevertheless whether it is one thing or the other it seems to me that it needs to be defined especially when local authorities are having to ask for resources <e>", "<cs> many of us consider that it was a great pity that the social fund under the social <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment i think one should say what tremendous pressure is put on social workers when they have the responsibility of deciding whether or not to leave a child with disabled parents who love their child but who may not have quite the facilities for caring for that child <e> <s> it has to be recognised that enormous support needs to be given <e> <s> however i believe that parents with a disability certainly should not have a child removed from them on that ground only <e>", "<cs> i fully support the noble baroness lady david in everything that she said <e> <s> i am worried about the mechanism of it all <e> <s> to begin with i believe it is absolutely essential as regards clause that children who have been in care should be helped by the local authority up to the age of years <e> <s> after all those of us who are over the age of <e>", "<cs> no i do not believe i said that <e>", "<cs> i wish to take a slightly different attitude over the whole situation <e> <s> i believe that there has to he a national plan for the care of children under five <e> <s> i do not think it ought to be left to each individual authority to interpret either my noble friends amendment or the amendment of the noble baroness lady david and her colleagues <e> <s> i am sure that the department of health and the department of education and science must be thinking along these lines because each of those departments has given a substantial grant to the national childrens bureau to look into and to research the needs of children under five <e>", "<cs> i apologise if it appeared that i thought the responsibility for that would not devolve upon local authorities <e> <s> it would be exactly the same as the administration of the education acts in that the policies are formulated by the department of education and science but are carried out by local authorities <e> <s> i would assume that that would be exactly the same case with the plan for children under five <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask two questions <e> <s> i should like to put this point to the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> surely when that influx of people arrived in his area the education act was obligatory and children had to be sent to school <e> <s> it must have been very expensive with the increased population <e> <s> also i firmly believe that providing better services for our under-fives would be cost-effective in terms of alleviating some of the difficulties which would otherwise arise later with children having to be taken into care or having youth custody orders made on them <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for his clear explanation and all members of the committee who have supported the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> one obviously cannot press it first because the wording is not quite right and secondly because it is really a matter for housing <e>", "<cs> based upon experience i support this amendment <e> <s> there have been times when it has been heart-rending when a mother has turned up and taken her child straightaway when one has not as the noble lord lord meston said had time to prepare the child or even to get its clothes ready <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment though perhaps from a different point of view <e> <s> in order to meet the individual needs of a child a very skilled initial assessment has to be made of that childs needs <e> <s> at the moment a kind of tariff system is often operated <e> <s> first of all social services departments or perhaps a voluntary organisation try to put a child into a foster home <e> <s> that fails so the child is moved to another foster home <e> <s> that fails and the child is then put into a childrens home <e> <s> that fails and finally the child is either sent to a school for maladjusted children or perhaps comes before a juvenile court and is put into youth custody by which time the child is perhaps or years old and it is too late to influence him to any great extent <e> <s> i support the amendment in order to press for a skilled initial assessment to be made of a child so that he is not moved from place to place while he is in care <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all those who have spoken and particularly to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> i take the point that he makes and i am grateful that before the next stage of the bill he will consider a rephrasing not absolutely so that emphasis is put on relatives and friends <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is quite obvious that in your lordships committee we all agree with the spirit of the amendment and it is also obvious that there are different views on how it should be dealt with and framed as was said by the noble and learned lords lord simon of glaisdale and lord hailsham and by others <e> <s> therefore with the assurance given by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on behalf of the children in care who have made this representation may i say how very grateful they will be to the noble and learned lord for what he has said <e> <s> they will be very grateful to him for saying that he will look at this matter again and bring it forward at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> to save the time of the committee i should like to speak also to amendment no <e> <s> which seeks to leave out the words in exceptional circumstances <e> <s> the bill as drafted states <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene briefly to say that the secretary of state for social security has agreed to accept a deputation from statutory and voluntary bodies on this very matter <e> <s> that meeting will take place in a fortnights time and arises from the discussion of the amendment which was moved by the noble baroness lady david in an earlier session of the committee <e>", "<cs> we are in difficulty here because this is very much a question of social work practice <e> <s> i know of one child who absconded times <e> <s> i said to him if you abscond once more we <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what was said by the noble lord lord meston <e> <s> i believe that it is necessary to have a meeting or whatever it <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i understand the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i usually do but on this occasion i am not quite sure that i understand him <e> <s> the bill states that the child should be consulted and that the parents should be consulted <e> <s> one cannot have those consultations without a meeting <e> <s> it is implicit that a meeting should be held <e>", "<cs> i seek information from the noble lord lord prys-davies <e> <s> i appreciate the need for a complaints procedure <e> <s> in time gone by when the authorities were small the children very often knew who the director or the childrens officer was and felt that they could go to that person with their complaints <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the point i raised is not really covered <e> <s> i wish to know whether the complaints manager will be someone within the social service department or someone outside that department <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment of the noble baroness lady david perhaps i may save time by speaking to amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> i am asked to bring it before the committee by the national association for the protection of children in care <e> <s> the amendment is very much in line with amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> the position is the same as that described by the noble baroness lady david namely that <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is right that i chaired that meeting and that the majority of the people there supported the amendment <e> <s> however the noble baroness will remember that while i do not necessarily disagree with her amendment there is another point of view to be considered before we finally decide on the matter <e>", "<cs> not in this case <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful for some clarification from the proposers of the two amendments <e> <s> the amendment of the noble lord lord kilmarnock refers to a child of similar background <e> <s> i interpreted the word similar to mean that one should look after a mentally handicapped child in a way different from the way in which one would look after a normal child <e> <s> for instance one would not allow a mentally handicapped child to run out and play in a playground four floors down whereas one might allow a similar child who was not mentally handicapped to do so <e> <s> i would be worried about the word background <e> <s> what seems unkind to the child in one case would not be unkind in another <e> <s> what is right for one child may not be right for another <e> <s> in the case of two mentally handicapped children one would keep them in and not let them run about <e> <s> for two other children one might allow them out to play <e> <s> i should like clarification from the proposers of the amendments <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble baroness lady david on the need for flexibility in this area <e> <s> it seems to me that there are a number of children who absent themselves from school or do not go to school at all <e> <s> if one looks at those cases there are very often social problems not problems of the school which should be dealt with by social services departments <e> <s> in many authorities the education department will refer such cases to the social services department as being a social problem <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may just say that from the point of view of this bill i am satisfied with the explanation given to us by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> however i should like to make a plea about something on which the noble baroness lady david and i feel strongly namely that the whole situation with regard to education welfare officers and the social services should be looked at though perhaps not in these amendments and not in this bill <e>", "<cs> i have one further point to make <e> <s> if this provision is put into either regulations or circulars i hope that it will also be circulated to the other professions involved that is to the health and education services <e> <s> the reason why in the first instance we thought it should go into primary legislation was that the other professions would note it if it were in primary legislation <e> <s> however having <e>", "<cs> as one who has had to administer such provisions i should like to say for goodness sake dont lets have any cross <e>", "<cs> i understand from the noble lord lord banks that these amendments are grouped together <e> <s> perhaps i may speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> representations have been made to me by a number of guardians ad litem that they would greatly welcome professional support from one another and that they would also like instead of being what one might call a home industry to be grouped under a senior person with whom they could consult <e>", "<cs> i have a deep admiration and respect for the nspcc and also for my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> nevertheless i rise to put a different point of view about the assessment order which he has recommended <e> <s> i speak as a retired director of social services but i also speak on behalf of the association of directors of social services in this country <e> <s> that association does not favour the child assessment order <e> <s> i do not have the report on kimberly carlile but if i remember aright the social worker did not see the child <e> <s> had the social worker done so she would presumably have sought as this bill would lay down an immediate emergency protection order <e> <s> the visit to the doctor by the child would have had to be put off because if the social worker had seen the child she would have wanted to remove her at once <e>", "<cs> we are in some difficulty here <e> <s> my noble and learned friend said that it is the intention that voluntary homes should not be used for secure accommodation <e> <s> however there is justification when a child perhaps becomes seriously epileptic or is in similar great difficulty and one does not want to move the child away from the home but it is necessary to put him in secure accommodation <e> <s> that may be necessary for only a short time perhaps a week three weeks or a month <e>", "<cs> the amendment so well described by the noble lord lord prys-davies illustrates a tremendous problem <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him two questions <e> <s> first if relatives take a child for money does he presume that those relatives are foster parents <e> <s> secondly what happens in an emergency <e> <s> for example a woman may be rushed into hospital and the father may place the child with someone until the next morning <e> <s> does he believe that his amendment covers those two point <e>", "<cs> if the parents or a parent place a child with relatives and pay them does the noble lord presume that they are foster parents <e>", "<cs> unlike the noble lord lord seebohm i do not propose to be brief <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will forgive me if i speak at some great length <e> <s> if i may i shall speak to my amendment no <e> <s> which concerns the training of personnel in the social services and probation departments <e> <s> the amendment moved by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway is wider than amendment no <e> <s> but the spirit and intentions behind both our amendments are the same <e>", "<cs> had given notice of her intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble and learned friend for his reply <e> <s> i put forward the amendment so as to put up a marker that the matter must be kept under review that there will be difficulties and that there are difficulties now <e> <s> i am sure that my noble and learned friend knows that full well <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for his explanation <e> <s> i should like to think about this matter and read carefully what has been said <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my respect and admiration for my noble friend lady cox know no bounds <e> <s> however in this debate which she has so ably initiated i find myself putting forward a somewhat different point of view <e> <s> perhaps that is to be expected <e>", "<cs> my lords as an ex-chief officer and a director of social services i absolutely agree with my noble and learned friend on the woolsack <e> <s> city councillors i am afraid will not read the whole bill <e> <s> they will just consult it to find out what the duty of local authorities is <e> <s> if this provision remains in its suggested place a number of them will not see it because they will only look up the relevant part of the bill <e> <s> that may be a bad argument but it is a realistic one <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask a question for clarification <e> <s> the amendment reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble lord lord meston <e> <s> we want the best available services for all children be they indigenous or be they of the ethnic minority <e> <s> that is what we ought to follow <e> <s> i would go further and say that of course one wants to encourage the ethnic groups to feel that they are part of the community <e> <s> however i think we ought to go a little futher back than this if we do not develop training here the phrase day care is mentioned for the ethnic groups and if they re not encouraged to come forward for training we shall not get the best service for children of the racial community <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise as president of the national childrens bureau which was commissioned by the then department of health and social security to carry out research into the working of the adoption allowances scheme in england and wales <e> <s> at the time when the adoption allowances were announced it was a revolution because never before had allowances been paid to adopters <e> <s> as the noble baroness has said the children who have been greatly helped and who might otherwise not have been helped have been the disadvantaged children <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment would safeguard a number of disabled people who are well able to provide a good home <e> <s> however i regret to have to say that there is sometimes a climate of opinion in an area that disabled people cannot give a good home <e> <s> the amendment would go a long way towards providing disabled people with the reassurance they need <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make four points <e> <s> the first is that it seems to me that under these amendments each local authority should carry out a survey of the needs of their areas <e> <s> where there is high unemployment it is possible to have one scheme of things where there is low unemployment another scheme of things <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in some difficulty with this amendment which nevertheless i support because we are straying into another department and another act <e> <s> our difficulty is that under clause we are looking at a child in need and the bill lays a duty on the local authority to look into the needs of children <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord has said a child in need is defined in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i shall of course withdraw the amendment <e> <s> we can then debate his amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for his reply <e> <s> i have two points to make <e> <s> first the word carer is coming into being very much more than it ever has before in all social work legislation in connection with the elderly and the handicapped <e> <s> it is a word that is attaining common usage in a way that it never did before <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one point that has not been made throughout the debate <e> <s> it is that children in foster homes are vulnerable children <e> <s> they are not like the noble lord lord mottistone who has had a wonderful life and could tolerate having had a good old whang and battering <e> <s> children in foster homes are vulnerable and often have deep emotional feelings of animosity against life <e> <s> one does not want to add to that <e> <s> it is therefore right that we do not have corporal punishment in community <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for trying to help us <e> <s> there are still some matters on which i need further help <e> <s> first the noble and learned lord has spoken about coming out of care <e> <s> i presume that he means up to the age of and not just the time when young people leave care at the moment which is at the age of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the horizon looks slightly brighter than it did before he spoke <e> <s> i am worried because even now under the children bill local authorities are able to befriend and assist but they do not <e> <s> some do and some do not <e> <s> therefore if it is not put more strongly in the bill many local <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may and if those who have spoken agree i should like to see the secretary of state for social security to ask whether he can do something through the social fund <e> <s> if he can i do not say that we shall be home and dry but at any rate there will be a fall-back position <e> <s> i should like very much to ponder and read what my noble and learned friend has said and at this stage to withdraw the amendment but with the thought of bringing it back at the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am waiting for my noble and learned friend to put the matter to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for that reply <e> <s> i realise that amendment no <e> <s> covers the whole point as he said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it likely that regulations will define the phrase provision of services <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that in principle i am sad about the amendment <e> <s> i am sad about the fact that it should have to be <e> <s> i think that for children to feel that they must go to court against their parents is something which one would not want to encourage in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friend lady elliot in what she said about the access to personal files social work scotland regulations <e> <s> the minister said that in essence the regulations for scotland and england were the same except for regulation <e> <s> however perhaps i may underline what my noble friend lady elliot said <e> <s> in fact the situation is very different in scotland from england <e> <s> we are very much concerned that in scotland the panel system should not lose the confidence of parents of children of social workers or of the police <e> <s> if the confidentiality is not safeguarded the panels will lose the present extraordinarily good reputation that they have in the community <e> <s> the position in england is quite different because a child coming before the court has to see the report which has been submitted to the court <e> <s> that does not necessarily break confidence but there is not always the full information in that report <e>", "<cs> my lords if mental hospitals are to be closed what alternatives are there in the community for the patients <e> <s> in addition when will the griffiths report be implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords the setting up of this service was an imaginative concept on the part of her majestys government <e> <s> at the last stage of the bill as the noble lord lord banks said the noble and learned lord said that the setting up of a regional structure was being considered <e> <s> it is the question of the structure of the guardian ad litem service on which i should like to comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to put the other point of view on behalf of the association of directors of social services and on my own behalf as an ex-director of social services <e> <s> suppose we take as the noble lord lord mottistone did a child or perhaps two children jack and jill <e> <s> if jack and jill have suffered some harm as was described by the noble lord lord mottistone and the health visitor thinks that the children have been bruised the social worker might be unable to persuade the parents voluntarily to go to a medical centre <e> <s> i suggest that if a child has not been harmed or damaged by the parents per cent <e> <s> of the parents will go voluntarily <e> <s> therefore we are talking of only a small number <e> <s> if they will not go voluntarily why not <e> <s> it is either because they do not like the social worker or because they have something to hide <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add one point <e> <s> the amendment states that <e>", "<cs> my lords at the previous stage of the bill i moved an amendment on training for social work <e> <s> i believe profoundly that the bill will not succeed unless social workers in all spheres are well trained <e> <s> i welcome the amendments and i thank the noble and learned lord and all concerned for the great thought that has been given to them <e> <s> i am sure that the world of social work will be grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords it will perhaps save the house time if i speak to amendment no <e> <s> a which is very much on the same lines <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> a also stipulates that in imposing on a young offender the new residential requirement created by <e>", "<cs> my lords are there any plans to increase the number of staff on the platforms particularly at night and during the tourist season <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord taylor of hadfield for allowing me to speak i had exchanged places with the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to point out that under the education bill which was based on the warnock report on childrens special educational needs education departments were enjoined to leave children with special educational needs in the community with their parents and families as far as possible and practicable <e> <s> the noble lord lord carter will remember the amendment <e> <s> therefore amendment no <e> <s> a would be in line with the education act <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not divide the house at this stage of the bill <e> <s> however i am disappointed with my noble and learned friends reply <e> <s> we believe as is stated in the bill that the interests of the child are paramount <e> <s> perhaps or per cent <e> <s> of parents who ask for their children to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord for his explanation <e> <s> i realise that this issue relates to the social security system <e> <s> but the noble and learned lard has also referred to clause which says <e>", "<cs> congratulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall make just two comments <e> <s> i support the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord prys-davies said that the amendment was designed to safeguard the interests of children <e> <s> i hope that the complaints procedure will also apply to parents <e> <s> the present disclosure procedure will also apply to parents <e> <s> the present disclosure procedure adopted by many local authorities is so long drawn out that many men are kept away from their families when they have not been proved guilty <e> <s> i hope that the complaints procedure will apply to parents as well as children for the sake of the children <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble lord lord prys-davies <e> <s> i agree absolutely with him that a conflict of interests arises when the guardians ad litem are connected with the local authority social services departments <e> <s> at the same time i believe that the local authorities have to be involved <e>", "<cs> my lords when discussing this matter with the noble lord lord seebohm and the noble lady lady kinloss we agreed that we expected exactly the answer that the noble and learned lord has given <e> <s> i realised that there might be some difficulty in reporting to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of us have had correspondence with lincolnshire county council <e> <s> the council tells us that people from overseas have placed children in private foster homes and have then left <e> <s> sometimes they do not visit the children and occasionally they do not come <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank the noble and learned lord for his response <e> <s> we are all most grateful for what he has said <e> <s> it must be said that the number of children we have in residential care is far too high and this provision would go some way towards helping the magistrates to realise that residential care orders cannot be made so easily <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as a lay person <e> <s> what i lack in not being a member of the judiciary perhaps i make up for in objectivity on the issue we are debating <e> <s> as a social worker i am enabled to speak for those who come before the courts or who need and seek the services of the law and indeed for a number of clients of the legal system <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute to the noble and learned lord on the woolsack and thank him for the green paper <e> <s> i am surprised that there is so much worry that the document should have been produced as it is <e> <s> if we had not a green paper how would those of us who are lay people know what was under discussion and what were the points being put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that the nurseries and child-minders regulation act was not mentioned in the children bill <e> <s> further can he say what will happen under the provisions of the children bill as regards both registration and inspection of nurseries especially those which will be run by industry and commerce <e> <s> such nurseries will need help and advice as well as registration and inspection <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the survey on the social fund is my noble friend able to say as he has done previously who is helped <e> <s> is there also a survey as to the people who have not been helped under the social fund and how is that being monitored <e> <s> many poor people many homeless people and many single-parent families are unable to set up a home because they have not been able to obtain help from the social fund <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be possible to have a new order called a care and treatment order with a condition of residence at a detoxification centre or a hostel <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that women are equal with men but that they are different <e> <s> there were no women on the roof at risley during the present troubles <e> <s> would it not be possible for women on remand there are of them at risley to be placed in hostels run perhaps by the salvation army and the church army as bail hostels <e> <s> that would give more places at risley <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may come back to my amendment <e> <s> first when my noble friend lord mottistone says that this amendment is not necessary i should like to say that while everything may be going well in the isle of wight i know of mental hospitals where patients have been discharged without any after-care plan whatever <e> <s> in fact one big mental hospital just outside london closed and the patients were discharged <e> <s> they were given clothes and money and were dispersed along the south coast <e> <s> there was no after-care plan for them whatever <e> <s> therefore we are very grateful for this bill produced by my noble friend lord mottistone because it is absolutely necessary <e> <s> i only wish that it applied to all mental patients <e> <s> however the fact remains that the present situation is unsatisfactory despite clause of the mental health act <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make two points <e> <s> the first is that i am grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone supported by my noble friend lady elliot in bringing to our attention the situation regarding schizophrenics <e> <s> i regard this bill perhaps as a forerunner to something else <e> <s> the second point i wish to make in supporting the noble lord lord ennals concerns the families of the patients <e> <s> there are some families who are so stable and skilled that they are able to deal with their own schizophrenics <e> <s> there are other families who are less able and more vulnerable and they cannot deal with a much less serious condition <e> <s> it is for that reason that i support the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> i also agree with all his other arguments <e> <s> but it is very difficult to assess the situations of families that can cope and those that cannot <e> <s> one is not going to help the patient unless one helps the families <e> <s> some families need more help than others even if the patient is less ill <e> <s> therefore i support the noble lord lord ennals <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the position with regard to young persons <e> <s> i understand from the magistrates of hull that young people are being kept in the prison there three to a cell for hours a day <e> <s> surely it would be better for such young people not to be in prison but in bail hostels or elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord lord stallard i welcome this bill and thank my noble friend lord henley for having introduced it <e> <s> i recognise that there are some points which need to be dealt with in this house and i hope that we shall be able to persuade her majestys government to make some alterations so that it leaves here an even better bill than it is at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall wait and see what comes out of this debate <e> <s> i take the noble baronesss point <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble lord lord ross of new port for bringing before your lordships house the problem of homelessness which has increased and is increasing at a most alarming rate <e> <s> i wish also to congratulate my noble friend the minister on being so apparently bright and alive when one considers the late night that he had last night on the electricity bill in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i beg the houses pardon <e> <s> if it was the water bill it must have been even worse or perhaps it amounted to the same thing <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend the minister will clarify one point for me <e> <s> in supporting the amendment of my noble friend lord norrie as i do very fully my noble friend said that she was quite sure that the electricity industry would take note of all that was said <e> <s> but people change governments change the electricity board changes <e> <s> therefore unless there is something more specific along the lines of the amendment of my noble friend lord norrie such as a code of practice or a provision in the bill i am not quite sure how my noble friend can give us the assurance that she has given us <e> <s> i should be grateful for some help <e> <s> i shall not elaborate any further as my noble friend lord norrie has spoken so extremely fully and well that there is no need to add anything further <e> <s> but i should be grateful for some help from my noble friend the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank my noble friend for incorporating in the bill the points that i made in committee <e> <s> i should like to make one <e>", "<cs> my lords we again thank the noble baroness lady turner for initiating this debate today it is both timely and important <e> <s> as the eighth speaker i have to say that everything that i was going to say has been said but i propose to say it all again <e> <s> i propose to do so because it will show that we are all thinking along the same lines and that we all consider the matter to be important <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness will allow me to intervene a moment <e> <s> i am disappointed because although i gave the minister a text about local government he has not replied to that point <e> <s> i wonder whether he has overlooked it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank my noble friend the minister for the letter that he has written to me today concerning hull prison where there is serious overcrowding of young remand prisoners <e> <s> perhaps i may also thank him for and indeed congratulate him on the action that has been taken there <e> <s> however is he able to tell us whether the various recommendations that he has made concerning the buildings could be brought forward <e> <s> he says that b wing for instance will be improved within three years <e> <s> would it not be possible to bring that forward <e>", "<cs> he did not fail <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the third point was the unavoidable effect <e> <s> if child benefit is tied to family credits it is very costly <e> <s> the treasury feels that it must keep down family credits in order not to cost the country a great deal of money <e>", "<cs> i thank all members of the committee who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> in particular i thank my noble friend the leader of the house <e> <s> nine peers have spoken for the amendment <e> <s> although my noble friend lady carnegy asked two questions she spoke against the amendment <e> <s> therefore five noble peers have spoken against it <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i understand my noble friend lord joseph <e>", "<cs> i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> if i said family benefit i meant child benefit <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord joseph for putting me right not for the first time <e>", "<cs> i thank all members of the committee who have spoken <e> <s> i wish to ask my noble friend the minister two questions <e> <s> first he said that anyone can claim the allowance but it cannot be awarded for six months <e> <s> is that correct <e> <s> i must say that if a patient is being cared for in his own home and the person caring for him i am sure the noble baroness lady seear will agree with me here has a very low income that person has no option but to run into debt or as my noble friend the duke of norfolk said have the patient admitted to hospital <e>", "<cs> while absolutely agreeing with the amendment of my noble friend the duke of norfolk i am dealing exclusively and only at this moment with amendment no <e> <s> which is my amendment <e> <s> despite the fact that my noble friend has taken on board my ingenious suggestion of a relative and in view of the fact that he has shown very great sympathy with this amendment at this stage i will read in <e>", "<cs> i should just like to make two points before the minister replies <e> <s> we are also discussing amendment no <e> <s> here and i agree with the noble earl lord russell that i should perhaps have included that in my speech <e> <s> my up-to-date information is that appeals take between three and four months to be heard <e> <s> this is really a very serious matter <e> <s> i wonder as i wondered in connection with other matters whether some provision could be made by way of regulation to cover this situation so that such appeals would be heard much quicker than they are at present <e>", "<cs> i think that what my noble friend lord renton said is rather strange <e> <s> i say that because in such a situation there would surely be a vice-chairman who could take over <e> <s> for example in a court case if the chairman of the bench is not present then the number two on the bench takes his place <e> <s> therefore i am not sure whether my noble friends argument holds water <e>", "<cs> i wish to intervene in fairness to the advisers <e> <s> the three to four-month period does apply <e> <s> however there has been a downward curve just lately <e>", "<cs> i always hesitate to bring an exchange to an end <e> <s> this exchange has been extraordinarily interesting and amusing though it is a pity that it has been on such a tragic subject <e> <s> but i am grateful to my noble friend for the long explanation <e> <s> perhaps it is our fault that we have not fully understood it <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment following the debate that the noble baroness lady turner initiated in the chamber yesterday on the question of working women in particular having to find a place for their children before work <e> <s> members of the committee will remember that the childminding association is going to set up a panel of child minders <e> <s> employers will be able to use this childminding service as they did with meal vouchers <e> <s> however such arrangements will take time <e> <s> in our debate yesterday perhaps the noble baroness lady turner will confirm this we said that we hoped that the interests of the child were paramount when a woman goes out to work <e> <s> it takes time not necessarily to find a good childminder but to find the right one for that child <e>", "<cs> since my amendment no <e> <s> is in the list of groupings and also bears the name of the mover of amendment no <e> <s> perhaps i may speak to it although i regard it as a probing amendment particularly as it concerns two other departments the home office and the ministry of health <e> <s> i apologise to my noble friend the minister for not having given him notice of this amendment <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i must say that i am in a real dilemma <e> <s> i am grateful to everyone who has spoken and i agree with everything that has been said <e> <s> however being a realist i agree with my noble friend lord trafford <e> <s> it hurts me to say this but the minute the people who run bed and breakfast establishments hear that the benefit has been raised they will put up the rent <e> <s> although the noble lord lord winstanley says that that will take a long time to occur i have to tell him that it would only take a week because the rent is paid weekly <e>", "<cs> i agreed with my noble friend lord trafford when he said that something must be done <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> of course something must be done <e> <s> however i should have thought of this before suppose we go forward with the proposal and the people who run the bed and breakfast accommodation put up the rents <e> <s> in that case the families and their children will not be any better off <e> <s> that is what worries me and that is the point i should like my noble friend the minister to address <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take up various points which have been raised <e> <s> unless one has visited a bed and breakfast place one does not and cannot understand the situation <e> <s> the noble lords lord winstanley and lord pitt have obviously visited bed and breakfast places and know about them <e>", "<cs> as this amendment is grouped with amendments nos <e> <s> and a perhaps i may speak to amendment no <e> <s> and support the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> i have received letters from the national council for voluntary child care organisations which covers voluntary organisations i have received a letter from the scottish council for single homeless which covers edinburgh and glasgow i have received a letter from the scottish association of childrens panels from the british association of childrens panels and from the national childrens bureau <e> <s> i have therefore received letters from throughout the united kingdom on this matter <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble lord and i do so because i have practical experience of what it is like to be responsible for industrial training units in local authorities which are run for the mentally disadvantaged and the mentally handicapped <e>", "<cs> as the daughter of a war widow of the war i have deep sympathy with the intentions behind the amendment <e> <s> however i am not sure that it is an equitable amendment <e> <s> i do not see how it could possibly be consistent <e> <s> a colonel draws one type of pension a brigadier another a lieutenant another and a corporal another <e> <s> does the amendment apply to all those who draw different levels of pension <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any possibility of having a treaty of agreement with nigeria as suggested by the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> i wonder whether the figures are correct <e> <s> the figures that i received from the hillingdon authority which is responsible for taking these children into care are higher than the figures stated by my noble friend <e> <s> these hapless children have to be taken away from their parents <e> <s> not only is the child separated from its parents but all its toys goods and clothing are taken <e> <s> the child is placed in a white foster home where it remains for two or three years according to the sentence and then goes back with the mother to nigeria <e> <s> would it be possible to have a completely different arrangement <e> <s> could there not be hostels for mothers with children <e> <s> mothers would receive a probation order with a condition of residence and the hostels would be paid for by the ill-gotten gains of the mother or alternatively by the nigerian government <e>", "<cs> my lords following the statement by my noble friend the minister perhaps i may ask whether the data report will show how many people would go into institutional care if they did not receive the mobility allowance <e> <s> will this report show that <e> <s> i believe that it is a very significant figure inasmuch as institutional care for this category of people is very expensive <e>", "<cs> my lords if i remember rightly at the last stage of the bill my noble friend the minister was very sympathetic to the whole matter of the recommendations made by the hospice movement <e> <s> he said that he was willing to consider them and bring the consideration to the fore <e> <s> i think that we have all received representations from the hospice movement that this is something not of an emergency but that cannot wait all that long perhaps it cannot wait for another social security bill next year <e> <s> therefore i wonder whether my noble friend the minister would address his mind to a proposal being put forward such as the noble baroness has suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord henderson for moving the amendment <e> <s> i moved a similar one in committee <e> <s> i withdrew it although it was supported on all sides because i wanted to make further inquiries about the comments made by the noble lord lord trafford and the health of the children involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister <e> <s> when one changes from one system to another there is always difficulty with the bridging process <e> <s> at the moment there is no doubt that there is a big change of policy on the part of her majestys government namely that lone women should go out to work and that the market forces should take over and provide the nursery accommodation or accommodation for the care of their children <e> <s> that is only the first step towards this new process <e> <s> for example i know that the banks have started crches <e> <s> i know for example that marks and spencer intends to buy in places <e> <s> nevertheless while this new system is taking over there are difficulties for lone parents and their children <e>", "<cs> my lords i add one comment from the point of view of those people who are running these centres <e> <s> it is difficult to instil into the people men and women a desire to work if some are receiving one amount of money and the others receiving less <e> <s> i have to say that it is difficult to inspire those who are receiving less to work harder when they see their colleagues at the next bench receiving much more <e> <s> if we are to get them back onto the labour market and into the workforce they should be earning about the same amount instead of having this differentiation within a project <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> as an ex-director of social services whose clients are very much involved with the social fund i think the provision would be a great safeguard for those clients for the officers administering the social fund and the local authorities whose clients are the ones to be involved in this matter <e> <s> i therefore support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords amendments nos <e> <s> and are grouped together <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson moved amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i shall if i may speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> although the amendments are different they are inter-related <e> <s> both concern two groups of young people aged to years <e>", "<cs> my lords is the health of the children being monitored bearing in mind the number of those not receiving school meals but having inadequate types of food <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lords argument is right why does his party wish to get rid of the house of lords <e>", "<cs> my lords for the information of your lordships house may i ask my noble friend the minister whether the recommendations in the griffiths report on which i think there is to be a white paper are to be incorporated in the national health legislation or will there be an act on its own dealing with the report which will concern patients in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not cause for real concern that so many children are out of school on any one day in the school year <e> <s> research has shown that a number of children are not attending classes in school <e> <s> schools outreach is one of the organisations that can assist in dealing with the situation <e> <s> should not that organisation be better supported than it is <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make one comment on the subject of empty properties <e> <s> the noble baroness lady fisher has spoken about the very good housing authority that birmingham has <e> <s> we all know how good it is <e> <s> however in a number of places that i have visited lately there have been properties standing empty for three or four years <e> <s> i asked at the town hall why the properties were empty <e>", "<cs> my lords no i am not <e> <s> when i asked i was informed that the property was going to be developed <e> <s> i have been in the same position <e> <s> when i worked at oxford we had many empty properties <e> <s> minimal standards having been put in they were only minimal at least some of those little victorian houses with three rooms up and two rooms down were a home for tenants who were licensees <e> <s> they could then be moved out when development took place <e> <s> i implore local authorities i do not refer to birmingham which has used all its properties to use the properties that are standing empty <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether there is consultation in northern ireland at the initial stages when a bill is going to come before this house <e> <s> is he aware that when i was last in belfast i talked to the head of one of the teacher training colleges and he told me that he had not been consulted in any way concerning the last education bill which came before this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords the meeting with officials was arranged by the national council for voluntary organisations <e> <s> i am given to understand that the organisations met the officials and brought forward all the problems which have been enumerated in your lordships house today <e> <s> the organisations were satisfied and happy and felt that the officials had taken notice of what had been said <e> <s> despite the fact <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether these organisations have let him know how grateful they are and that they will be glad to meet him again <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that the salvation army has a register of missing persons in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say from a child care point of view that i hope in this country we shall not say that a coloured child must be placed with a coloured family <e> <s> by so doing we could deprive the child of a home background <e> <s> one would always hope that the child would be placed in a home where he or she would receive love continuity and security regardless of colour but that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord thinks that this is properly a matter for regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may put an opposite point of view <e> <s> i am all for having this provision in the bill <e> <s> i regret to say that there are a number of cases in social services and probation departments which are not allocated to a social worker or a probation officer because they have not been replaced and there is no one to deal with the case <e> <s> i support the inclusion of the provision in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord mottistone that people are divided on the issue <e> <s> the association of directors of social services agrees with the amendment put forward by the commons <e> <s> that body has come to an agreement with the nspcc <e> <s> the reason for that is that the application for an assessment order helps social workers who have nagging doubts whether there is a problem with a child but are not certain of it <e> <s> therefore they ask for a child assessment order <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make just one point <e> <s> i confess that i had another solution to the problem of an alleged abuser who does not want to move out of his home and feels that he is being unfairly treated <e> <s> my solution was to have an empty flat which we offered to the mother and the children for them to move to <e> <s> i think that that ought to be considered as well <e> <s> it could not possibly be put in the bill but it is good practice <e> <s> it is fair to the child for the child to remain with the mother brothers and sisters it is fair to the man because if he felt that he was being treated unfairly he could stay in the home <e> <s> i just throw in that suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall make just two comments <e> <s> the first is about the registration fee which the noble lady lady kinloss has already mentioned <e> <s> the president of the pre-school playgroup association is worried that the pre-school playgroups will be unable to pay the registration fee and the fee for being inspected once a year if that is what is intended <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend will know that it is inevitable that as a member of the family courts campaign i must say how disappointed we were about being unable to have a more specific law in respect of family courts <e> <s> there were some notable speeches in the other place and many speeches from all sides of the house in the other place on family courts <e> <s> on the other hand the solicitor-general on st october gave a very full explanation of why it was felt impossible to implement family courts under this bill and we accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords while i understand perfectly the comments of my noble friend lord renton i should like to congratulate the civil servants on the tremendous amount of consultation that has taken place over the pasi two years <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs and to my noble friend the minister if i am not here are the end of the debate <e> <s> i have a longstanding appointment at pm for some time i have sought an opportunity to bring before the house a recommendation that i made at the beginning of this month in a paper that i was invited to give at southampton university <e> <s> it is entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by making an apology to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale and to my noble friend the minister as i have a speaking engagement at seven oclock and i may not be able to get back in time to hear the ministers reply <e> <s> if i cannot get back in time to hear that i hope that i shall be forgiven <e>", "<cs> my lords as the th speaker i rise to support clause of the bill namely that research on embryos should be permitted within the present timespan of days and if it is licensed by the statutory licensing authority <e> <s> i wish to make three points one of which has not been made previously <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the very positive answer given by my noble friend the minister will he agree that the statement he made is not in accord with the various organisations which <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble and learned lord lord roskill for some help <e> <s> having had to deal with homeless families over many years i know that it is essential that cases should be dealt with quickly <e> <s> that is a great problem to those of us who have had to deal with homeless families <e> <s> leaving aside the legal situation where can the case be dealt with most expeditiously <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask my noble and learned friend to clarify one matter <e> <s> when dealing with the children bill we requested that the appeal procedure should lie in the chief executives department and not in the department involved which was the social services department <e> <s> if in this case there is an appeals procedure will it lie with the chief executive and not with the housing department <e>", "<cs> my lords i turn to a different subject <e> <s> i wish to speak about children who experience personal emotional and behavioural difficulties <e> <s> the subject has been touched on in part by the noble lord lord ritchie <e> <s> unless those children are wisely and skilfully helped within our education system in co-operation as the noble earl lord cairns said in his outstanding speech with the parents they will grow into a financial liability to the country as adults <e> <s> a proportion of them will become homeless a proportion of them will become delinquent and go to youth custody centres and later to prison and many of them will become unemployed <e> <s> there is not time to go into that difficult subject which causes teachers great worry <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that reply which i expected <e> <s> however does he agree that it is reprehensible that the central bus station in oxford city which was convenient albeit rather old has been replaced by a new bus station with no access to taxis <e> <s> people arriving on long-distance buses from london airport and elsewhere in england cannot find a taxi when they arrive at the bus station <e> <s> surely that matter should have been dealt with at the early stages of planning <e> <s> as the minister will know the old station at oxford has been replaced by a new station <e>", "<cs> with no access for the elderly and handicapped other than a bridge and steps <e> <s> does he agree that that point should also have been dealt with and that network southeast should have taken note of the department of transports advice <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment and hope that the noble lord lord walton will withdraw it with a view to the matter coming up again at report stage after discussions with the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i start my remarks by congratulating the noble earl lord russell on his speech which was outstanding <e> <s> having said that i withdraw the jam because i cannot support the amendment <e> <s> i believe that we must discuss and revise the bill <e> <s> we must change it through the usual procedures which we have in the house <e> <s> like the noble lord lord dainton i am not entirely against the bill <e> <s> i accept the principle that where parents are in a financial position to pay for the further education of their sons and daughters they should do so <e> <s> i also recognise that there needs to be funding for higher education in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor one question <e> <s> i am not quite clear and should like some guidance as to who is to make the decision <e> <s> is it to be the clinicians to whom the mother goes <e> <s> is it to be made jointly by social workers and medical staff <e> <s> is it to be left to the licensing authority <e> <s> how is the decision to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like clarification from my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> i do not see why we are discussing the amendment when we have agreed to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> deals with the situation <e> <s> surely we cannot have amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ennals has put the case so well that i shall not repeat it <e> <s> however i wish to add that money available in this area is open to abuse <e> <s> in such an area we wish to close every door to every possible form of abuse <e> <s> i support the amendment although <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may follow that argument through <e> <s> if the child is told that the husband and wife who have brought him up are not his genetic parents he will then want to know who are his genetic parents <e> <s> what happens then <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose the amendment <e> <s> there is no reason why the short birth certificate should not be used if the parents wish as is the case in adoption <e> <s> in cases such as this the choice should be left with the parents and not made by us <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak on four topics <e> <s> i have spoken on them in your lordships house before <e> <s> i hope to do so again but i speak on the principle try try and try again even if you do not succeed to start with <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate which is based on two reports poses a very real dilemma for your lordships and in particular the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> figures published by the attorney general showed that in the cost of legal aid in this country was million <e> <s> by the cost has risen to more than million <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether this review will show how many of these young people have been in care and have no home or background <e>", "<cs> i should like some clarification <e> <s> is it certain that there is no relationship between the student loans company and the universities <e>", "<cs> as a back-bench conservative who very often votes against her party as is well known in the chamber i would be sorry if the noble baroness lady blackstone were to press the amendment <e> <s> i agree with the amendment but we have been given an assurance by my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> the secretary of state would be in a very strong position to say no as the committee had voted the other way <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will not press the amendment <e> <s> we shall then have a chance at the next stage to hear what the secretary of state has to say <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask my noble friend the minister about the access funds <e> <s> the committee will be aware that a cash-limited fund was set up under another act of parliament <e> <s> that was the social fund <e> <s> it was cash-limited <e> <s> two people had their right to cash turned down <e> <s> the case was brought here and this place ruled against the department of social security <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may follow the point made by the noble lord lord dormand and ask a question in relation to the amendment <e> <s> i had been going to ask it in relation to another amendment but i shall ask it now in the light of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> it has been laid down by the government that social workers should be trained for two years we had all asked for a three-year training return to their offices and then take a post-qualifying course of one two or three years <e> <s> i am not sure how the repayment of their loans will be manipulated <e> <s> the point may fall under this amendment and i merely ask that question of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to your lordships house and to my noble friend the minister for not having been here at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> i was in kent speaking to kent magistrates on the children act <e> <s> i shall be speaking in the main except as regards one particular point on community care <e> <s> i began to wonder whether that subject was in the bill at all because i am the rd speaker and only seven of them have mentioned community care in their speeches <e> <s> so i almost gave a shout of joy when the noble lord lord seebohm rose to his feet and spoke entirely about community care <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> perhaps she will tell me one day where the bad areas are <e> <s> i should like to know <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank my noble friend lord renwick for having raised the subject of dyslexia and the subject of children leaving school without adequate skills in reading writing or spelling <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute to the dyslexia association both nationally and locally <e> <s> we have a wonderful branch of the dyslexia association in oxford <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> first who is responsible for seeing that the chronically sick and disabled persons act is implemented <e> <s> secondly does my noble friend remember that on th february i asked a question about oxford station which is being newly built <e> <s> in the original plan no provision was made for the chronically sick and disabled to move from ore platform to another <e>", "<cs> my lords british rail says that it cannot install the lifts for three years <e> <s> what will happen to disabled people during those years <e>", "<cs> my lords are there plans to open hostels for young men on remand aged to so that they do not have to go to prison and mix with older prisoners <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment having been a chief officer in local government and director of social services <e> <s> i do so for three reasons <e> <s> first the expectations of the public on community care have been so raised that if community care is introduced slowly and is set back because of lack of money we shall lose the confidence of the public <e> <s> secondly my noble friend lady cox has said for a long time that a number of people in the nursing profession disapprove of social services departments carrying out this work <e> <s> if it is not properly carried out to start with people will lose confidence in the whole concept of community care <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may tell the noble lord lord butterfield that all directors of social services in this country are at the moment doing a survey in their areas of the need for facilities and the needs of the people who would use those facilities <e>", "<cs> i rise to express my support for the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> it is most important that it should be made absolutely specific to whom the community care provision is applicable <e> <s> it is not except in a certain part of the bill written anywhere specifically <e> <s> it is only right and proper that those who have to administer the provisions of the bill should know exactly to whom community care refers <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord lord seebohm <e> <s> his name should also have been appended to the amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may add a little to what he said <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down perhaps i may say that i find her explanation slightly complicated <e> <s> the minister stated in her first statement that section deals with district health authority consent for local authority placements <e> <s> however the amendment which stands in my name and that of the noble lord lord seebohm requires local authority consent before the district health authority placement if the local authority is required to pay <e> <s> it is complementary to section <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment but having read and thought about it again over the weekend i am a little worried about one point mentioned by the noble lord <e> <s> under the children act one always asks anyone first whether he or she has a conviction and secondly whether one has his or her permission to go to the police <e> <s> i always believe it right to ask for that permission <e> <s> if a person has a conviction of the type enumerated one usually receives a letter the next morning stating that they have another job and will be moving to another part of the country <e> <s> therefore one is saved the trouble of worrying the police for a reference <e> <s> i support the amendment but i now wish that a provision had been included to the effect that the applicant would be informed at the beginning that the police would be contacted and that his or her permission would be obtained <e>", "<cs> is it therefore intended to put it in regulations <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> the effect is the other way round to enable the government to have the views of the local authority associations that my noble friend thinks so good <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> i just say that the local authority associations often act as a bridge between the ministries and their plans and the people in the areas who put forth those plans <e> <s> i recognise that there is consultation between the ministries and the local authority associations <e> <s> i should like to read what the minister has said and <e>", "<cs> i apologise for not giving notice of this question but perhaps i may ask my noble friend the minister how many handicapped children are still being cared for in hospitals in this country <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord carter will feel that his amendment is applicable to that point because there are a number of hospitals and therefore there are children who are not in the care of the local authority <e> <s> they are not children in care but they are children in mental hospitals <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the spirit of both amendments <e> <s> we have already said how important it is that there should be joint assessment and joint planning between the district health authority and social services <e> <s> that is written into the amendment <e> <s> secondly as the noble lord lord seebohm has said it is important to have the words <e>", "<cs> under the children act guidance has been issued called <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> many people listen but do not hear <e> <s> they interpret what they want to interpret and not what is actually said to them <e> <s> if the assessment is in writing it is a help not only to them but to the social workers who are dealing with them <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment and shall make just one point <e> <s> in dealing with the various people who require help if they want a particular sort of service for example a woman from the middle east who does not want to go to a hospital where there are men who does not want a male doctor and there is no suitable hospital in the area it is very easy when one is busy to say that there is no other service <e> <s> one must make some effort to find them a place even if it is out of the area <e> <s> the amendment was suggested to us by the national council for voluntary organisations <e> <s> we support it from the standpoint of gender religious persuasion and the point of view of women <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord ennals for generously moving this amendment which stands in my name <e> <s> after due consideration i felt it right that another point of view should be put to the committee namely the point of view of the association of directors of social services <e>", "<cs> the point i was making in that connection is that there is another inspectorate outside the local authority the ministry of health local inspectorate <e> <s> perhaps i may be allowed to add that i have been an inspector as well as a director of social services <e>", "<cs> i too am puzzled about this matter because under the children act where there is one child in premises those premises must be <e>", "<cs> the national council for voluntary organisations wishes me to point out the number of young people who are moving away from rural areas and of elderly people who are staying and the number of village shops and post offices which are closing <e> <s> the situation in rural areas is becoming difficult for the elderly particularly those who are disabled and those who become ill perhaps those factors should be taken into account <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment in part based on the submission that i have received from the national council for voluntary organisations <e> <s> we must realise what the voluntary sector has to offer <e> <s> however it needs highly-trained people to organise its management <e> <s> it is often unnecessary for voluntary workers to be fully qualified although they must be given certain <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> i agree that in every voluntary organisation there are highly-skilled people for instance in barnardos and the national childrens home <e> <s> however there are others who supplement those people and who are vitally important <e> <s> they need to be given information in a less-skilled training programme <e> <s> we need training programmes for the highly-skilled and also the less-skilled people who offer a good service <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> however there is one difficult point in this respect <e> <s> the value of hospital social workers is that they are also on the staff of the social services department <e> <s> therefore if the doctors and the medical staff are going to recommend something in the community they must know what is going on there <e> <s> for example they must know whether there is a home help or whether there is a place available in a home <e>", "<cs> before we proceed would it not be wise for us to consult to see whether there is some way for the social services to pay per cent <e> <s> and the hospitals to pay per cent <e> <s> as the noble lord lord butterfield said the hospital social workers are the bridges between the two departments <e> <s> they work to the two departments <e> <s> rather than ask the health or social services to pay there should be a / arrangement <e> <s> i wonder <e>", "<cs> even if the local authority has overriding responsibility there is nothing one can do if the patient does not respond <e> <s> the committee will remember that some time ago i recommended that there should be a new court order and that people should be found to be in need of treatment <e> <s> my noble friend lord ferrers said that he thought it was a good idea but nothing has happened <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord seebohm in his amendment <e> <s> i shall not repeat all that he said but i ask the committee to look at the matter from the point of view of the staffs <e> <s> if you are working for a director of social services who also has wide responsibilities for housing or other departments you do not feel secure or that you are working for someone who is fully acquainted with the details of the situation <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend the minister for her reply <e> <s> clearly the social services departments will attempt to give every possible service to the person concerned in his or her own home <e> <s> the forcible removal of a person would be only a last resort <e>", "<cs> my lords as a trustee of one of the voluntary organisations whose grant has been cut perhaps i may ask my noble friend whether despite the figures that he gave he thinks that it is penny-wise pound-foolish at this time when homelessness is a growing problem to have cut the grants to voluntary organisations which work hard and give a good service <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble lord lord clifford in his recommendation for an integrated comprehensive child health care service which would deal with prevention treatment and rehabilitation <e> <s> but in practical terms how should this be done <e> <s> such a service is recommended by the british paediatric association the family practitioner committees the health visitors association the national association of health authorities in england and wales the national childrens bureau which has affiliated to it child care organisations including the childrens society the national association for the welfare of children in hospital the voluntary council for handicapped children and the british medical association <e> <s> it is therefore not only doctors but also health visitors social workers and all those dealing with children who support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down perhaps i may ask for a little enlightenment <e> <s> she said that an integrated comprehensive child health care service would be implemented but where in the bill does it say that it should be <e> <s> i am not clear about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to refer to a point that has not been made it is the perception of the community and the public <e> <s> when i was a director of social services i was often asked why dont you do this <e> <s> why doesnt your department help that person and do something <e> <s> i contend that members of the general public will welcome the amendment and i hope that they will be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> directors of social services carry an awesome responsibility when delegating people to look after the very vulnerable <e> <s> unless they are helped <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to refer to the people who must arrange for patients in hospitals to return to the community <e> <s> when people suffer from for example schizophrenia or a mental disability not only must one find accommodation for them but one must also deal with the neighbours in order to make them acceptable to the community <e> <s> if people are physically handicapped one must find separate places for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble lord lord ennals particularly on two points although i do so on many others <e> <s> regarding the place of social workers they are on the staff of the social services department but work in the hospitals <e> <s> at the moment a number of authorities are cutting back on the social services because of local government expenditure <e> <s> they have statutory duties to carry out under the various children acts and the children and young persons act <e> <s> in order to carry those out the authorities are withdrawing their social workers from child guidance clinics and hospitals <e> <s> this is a disastrous state of affairs because the social workers in hospitals are the bridge between the hospital and the community <e> <s> they are also the bridge between the doctors and the social workers in the community <e> <s> therefore it is essential that the position be clarified <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord hylton who is unable to be here today asked me to support the amendment on his behalf <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> there is a proportion of people who want help but if they are deaf blind they do not know where to go for it and do not even know that help is available <e> <s> such people have a right to expect or to be offered help which they may or may not accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to support this amendment from the point of view of a director of social services to whom someone may come and request a service for example a person who is blind may want to have a special book <e> <s> it would be quite impossible to run such a service in ones own local authority because it would be completely uneconomic when there are perhaps only a dozen such people to take into account <e> <s> however those peoples needs are very great <e> <s> therefore one must have recourse to an office in london <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask my noble friend whether the situation has changed <e> <s> when i was a director of social services and there was a crisis involving a person the authority where the crisis happened dealt with that person <e> <s> if that person did not pay rates in that area the authority was still bound to help that person but could claim from the authority where the rates were paid <e> <s> that was always the method we adopted <e> <s> has it changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove having been an inspector in both the home office and the department of health <e> <s> i have also as a director of social services been inspected <e> <s> so i have had the experience of an inspectorate from both points of view <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the minister talked about more informal consultative methods <e> <s> does he not agree that such informal consultative methods did not work in england from to <e> <s> does he not think that a more <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> social workers are in a very difficult position <e> <s> there have been many cases of children dying or being seriously abused <e> <s> social workers need to have a direct line management and need to know exactly who is responsible <e> <s> when i was running a small department no abuse case was dealt with without the papers arriving on my desk <e> <s> that gave social workers a sense of security <e> <s> i took the blame and the buck stopped there <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble lord lord clifford <e> <s> when he moved the amendment on th june it was supported by my noble friend lord mottistone by the noble lords lord ennals and lord peston by the noble baroness lady masham and myself <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly may i say that there seem to me to be two problems <e> <s> one is the here and now of people in a home and the other is the future <e> <s> under past amendments to the bill a local authority will have to agree to somebody going somewhere so that they will always be able to pay <e> <s> secondly as the noble lord lord mancroft said a lot of people are in homes at present and that is where there is great anxiety and worry <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> perhaps i may say to my noble friend lord renton that he has somewhat misunderstood the position <e> <s> the amendment lays emphasis on keeping people in their homes not taking them from their homes <e> <s> that is the main point of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> perhaps we ought to have put it the other way round <e> <s> the emphasis would then have been on keeping people in their homes instead of taking them out <e>", "<cs> my lords a fortnight ago i went to a conference at the kings fund centre and sat between two severely handicapped people <e> <s> neither of them had legs but they lived in a flat on their own <e> <s> the woman was a writer and the man was in the publishing business <e> <s> they were perfectly capable of looking after themselves mentally and of ordering their own lives <e> <s> i should have thought that in such circumstances where people are able to look after themselves the amendment would meet the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also sad that the other place has not agreed to the lords amendment on ring fencing <e> <s> however perhaps i may concentrate on some practical issues <e> <s> i do so for the sake of social services departments throughout the country so that they clearly understand the position <e>", "<cs> when my noble friend the minister replies will she tell the house whether the provision applies to childrens homes and hostels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in some difficulty because throughout the discussions on the bill i made two points <e> <s> first i said that community care would be expensive and that money would be required for community care <e> <s> secondly i said that the whole project should be monitored so that we would know how much money was required <e> <s> from the point of view of directors of social services i feel that without the money the new proposals cannot be implemented properly <e> <s> it would appear that the only answer is to choose certain projects for implementation with the money that is available <e>", "<cs> my lords if everything is going well within the london boroughs regarding strategic planning how is it that lady porter the chairman of westminster council is calling for an overall strategic plan to be agreed among the london boroughs <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i too can thank the noble and learned lord for the statement <e> <s> in the light of what the leader of the opposition said may i say that many of us are grateful that the noble and learned lord has himself spoken on the matter inasmuch as it is very closely linked to the children act <e> <s> the noble and learned lord took that bill through the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other noble lords in thanking and congratulating our three maiden speakers today <e> <s> they have enriched the debate <e> <s> i hope that they will continue to enrich your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other noble lords in thanking my noble friend the minister for explaining the bill to us <e> <s> it is consistent with the <e>"]
