["<cs> my lords i ask for that traditional courtesy which is given to maiden speakers <e> <s> it is almost years since i made my maiden speech in another place <e> <s> i am a mere babe in arms in terms of experience compared with my noble friend lord thorneycroft who has opened the debate and indeed the two previous maiden speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has been particularly closely involved with the steel industry over the past eight and half years perhaps i may congratulate the industry on its magnificent performance not least the performances of the two great steel plants at llanwern and port talbot and the tinplate industry in wales for its contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the concern shown by the noble lord lord sefton of garston who opened this debate about the nature of the problems we face <e> <s> it may be a surprise to some that i also very much share the views of my noble friend lord polwarth about the importance of regional policy <e> <s> i have long been an advocate of regional policy <e>", "<cs> i wish to bring the committee a little nearer to the present and to tell my noble friend who has just sat down that the practice of bringing to the government papers on dog licences has not grown less as time has passed <e> <s> i have lost count of the number of occasions when cabinet committees were convened and busy ministers gathered to discuss interminably this particular proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> does he recall that there was an interval of some months between my original announcement and the appointment of consultants <e> <s> does he recognise that the timetable for these large and complicated projects is extremely tight and that there will be the greatest difficulty in meeting it unless a firm timetable is laid out and is met at every stage <e> <s> will he take it from me and from those who have been involved in this matter for a long time that there can be no doubt that there is an imperative need for this crossing to be built by the mid-s to meet likely traffic demands <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may declare an interest as a director of the company which employs the largest number of registered dock workers <e> <s> will the government not prepare legislation to bring an end to this scheme <e> <s> it distorts trade blights the ports involved causes serious <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble lord lord peston in the course of his euology failed to address the central flaw in the health service so vividly described by my noble friend lord harris <e> <s> as a political candidate in i wrote a report on the health service in wales and bullied the noble lord lord prys-davies who was then chairman of the welsh hospital board <e> <s> as secretary of state i was responsible for the health service in wales for eight-and-a-half years <e> <s> i am as aware as anyone of the very real problems that confront us and i shall have something to say about that shortly <e> <s> i also assert that over the years since i prepared that report there has been a vast extension of health care <e> <s> that is true too of the period since when i took office <e>", "<cs> my lords as an old friend of mr tikkoo and incidentally can we spell his name correctly <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend whether he agrees that there can be no criticism of mr tikkoo in asking harland and wolff to build this ship although possibly he may be brave <e> <s> does he also agree that the government will have to look at the ability of harland and wolff to carry out the task and at the readiness of french and other european shipyards to undertake the task with or without subsidies <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped to be here until the end of the debate but i have a longstanding engagement and if i slip away before the end i hope the house will accept my apology <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to follow the noble lord lord raglan down the fascinating path that he trod except to say that he may be right that we should not necessarily seek to keep in this country every important picture that comes on to the market and that conservation should be a higher priority than it is <e> <s> i shall have more to say on that subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> before the debate is completed can he confirm that this country includes scotland wales and northern ireland and that his references to english heritage while absolutely appropriate should be extended to cadw and other bodies <e> <s> there has been a tendency to forget that many of the matters he dealt with actually apply to other parts of the united kingdom as well <e>", "<cs> my lords as chairman of the national rivers authority advisory committee i am particularly grateful to the noble baroness lady nicol whose absence we regret and the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos for giving me this opportunity to speak about some of the issues which my committee think are specially irnportant a number of which were referred to by the noble baroness lady white <e>", "<cs> my lords while supporting the point made by the noble lord lord mellish perhaps i may ask my noble friend at least to seek to ensure that tug operators and refuse barges do not collide with london bridges <e> <s> will the noble viscount urge that most urgent priority be given to the repair of battersea bridge which is closed totally dislocating an important part of londons traffic system <e> <s> the very sensible proposals by the local member of parliament mr bowis that the lighting systems and traffic flows on neighbouring bridges should be reviewed should also be looked at as a matter of great urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard said that he hoped experts would appear before the committee <e> <s> i am sure it is right that it is in the committee that many of the points which have been raised in this debate should be answered in detail <e> <s> however on behalf of the promoters i shall attempt to respond to at least some of the points raised by noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that among those of us who have responsibility for the ports i am a director of associated british ports there will be a warm welcome for the announcement that he has made and firm support for the proposed measures <e> <s> that is for the abolition of a scheme which is undoubtedly deterring investment in the ports which is distorting competition not only between british ports but other ports and continental ports and which is causing unjustified inequalities of treatment between different groups of people working in the same ports <e> <s> may i express the hope that those who work in the non-scheme ports will take full account of the considerably enhanced opportunities that will now arise in those ports as a result of the governments measures before they take any rash decisions about strike action <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to confess that i am a relatively recent convert <e> <s> although party to the original decision to privatise the water industry i was not an enthusiast <e> <s> after taking up my present job i argued for a while that it was the decision to go for an nra that was important and that it could operate almost equally well whether the industry was in the public or the private sector <e> <s> but as chairman of the advisory committee i have been uniquely placed to discover the condition of our rivers and the truth about what has been going on within the industry and inside government <e> <s> i changed my mind and have become one of the strongest advocates of privatisation <e> <s> i now firmly believe that simply to establish an nra to control public sector bodies would be a hopelessly unsatisfactory solution <e> <s> there are two reasons for that <e>", "<cs> the committee will understand that i had intended to go through a period of silence for a few days as i am involved in a somewhat embarrassing affair elsewhere for which i apologise <e> <s> i have been drawn to my feet on this occasion because i believe it right that as chairman of the advisory committee i should make it clear that the position spelt out by the minister is exactly and directly in line with the advice that the advisory committee has given after the most careful consideration of the practicalities of the issues <e> <s> we looked at this from the word go <e> <s> we were concerned with two matters <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether it is in order for me to rise again <e> <s> in any event the national rivers authority will review its arrangements from time to time <e> <s> we have spent a good deal of time in recent weeks discussing the practicalities of the arrangements we propose <e> <s> if we decided that it was necessary to make a change that is a matter that the nra will have to decide <e> <s> the nra advisory committee has taken the view that the nra will be the responsible body to decide whether the job is being done effectively and it believes that the arrangements are satisfactory <e> <s> of course it will review the position from time to time and it will no doubt have to answer in parliament and elsewhere if it is felt that it is not carrying out its duties effectively <e>", "<cs> i have reported to the committee that the nra would be faced with some severe practical difficulties at least in the first year or two in carrying out its functions effectively <e>", "<cs> that is not so <e> <s> i am chairman of a public body set up by the secretary of state to give advice <e> <s> it has been open throughout about the advice it has given <e> <s> what i have told the committee this afternoon is no more than i have told a large number of organisations to which i have spoken over the past six months <e> <s> the nra advisory committee has been open about the advice which has been submitted to the government <e> <s> it would have been a rather odd position if this committee was not as fully informed as the large number of organisations in the water industry which have heard the chairman of the nra advisory committee setting out its position in recent weeks and months <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitated throughout the debate on the bill to speak about the powers to be given to an authority which it is intended that i should chair <e> <s> it seemed to me that that course of action was the right one <e> <s> however on second reading and indeed when speaking on an earlier amendment i sought to give guidance to the house about the advice given to the government by the advisory committee <e> <s> as my words have been quoted back to me on many occasions during this debate i think that it would be right if i gave some clarification on the views of the nra advisory committee in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how much i welcome the recognition by the government of the advice given by the nra that there might be a problem over local authority precepts <e> <s> it was our principal remaining point of concern particularly in the light of the fact that the amendment moved in another place is entirely satisfactory as a clause <e> <s> the only issues that concerned us were the statements made by ministers at the time about its application <e> <s> i do not understand the details of the local authority borrowing mechanisms enough to comment about the way in which this will work but it is a recognition that will be welcomed throughout all the organisations involved in the flood defence work around the country among which there was great anxiety about these points <e>", "<cs> my lords as the chairman of the body responsible for drawing up this document that has been referred to and as someone who has been told that he will be taking over the responsibilities of the nra if this bill is finally passed would it be helpful to say that we fully understand and appreciate the point that has just been made <e> <s> these documents are not in their final form <e> <s> we are consulting and listening to representations about them <e> <s> we have yet to receive large numbers of the representations <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to speak because i feel i am treading a tightrope <e> <s> i have to avoid answering points which should properly be answered by ministers and commenting upon an advisory document issued by the committee which i chair <e> <s> i hope that i do not fall off that tightrope <e>", "<cs> my lords let me deal instantly with that point which has created a misunderstanding <e> <s> the water plcs have nothing to do with the matter at all <e> <s> at the moment the shadow nra units are still employed by the water authorities and until the bill passes they will remain in that position <e> <s> all that has happened here is that many months ago early in the proceedings one individual in the yorkshire authority produced by way of local discussion a paper suggesting the kind of structure that he thought might be appropriate <e> <s> it was circulated in yorkshire long before the issue had been considered by the advisory committee <e> <s> it now happens that that individual i am glad to say is a member of the advisory committee and will be playing a part in its deliberations <e> <s> that was very much an initial shot by someone involved in the industry who was having local consultation on this difficult issue <e> <s> it does not represent the advisory committees final views <e> <s> it considered the matter only a short time ago in time to produce the document that your lordships have seen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> she says that we are only dealing with five people but what would happen if as it seems to me is quite likely the nature conservancy council and the countryside commission nominated two three or four extremely suitable candidates including those from voluntary bodies all of whom one was minded to accept <e> <s> as i understand this clause one would either have to reject some of them or accept them and then accept at least three more from the voluntary bodies too <e> <s> i think the noble baroness is overlooking the fact that the nature conservancy council and the countryside commission will themselves be nominating the representatives of voluntary bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord find it helpful if i were to say that he has made an interesting and helpful suggestion on nominations <e> <s> these are obvious bodies who can put forward nominations without having the restrictive clause that he has proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mellish pointed out i speak to the house today as an employer although i must say that i am a recent and inexperienced employer <e> <s> i speak as a director of associated british ports the countrys largest port employer and the company with the largest number of ports covered by the scheme <e> <s> therefore i speak with a very obvious interest which i declare <e> <s> however i speak with a great deal more direct knowledge than i had when i was in government and that is a point to which i shall return in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord really said it himself because he described the nature of the industry with the vast variety between the ports <e> <s> it is precisely for that reason that the proper way to proceed is to discuss at local level <e> <s> i repeat what i said namely that there can be discussions this afternoon <e> <s> there can certainly be discussions tomorrow in every single port up and down the country if the transport and general workers union say yes you can go and talk to the employers <e> <s> surely the sensible thing would be to discuss and say let us get on with the talks and see how we can work out sensible arrangements for the good of the ports and the people who work in them <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may rise to make one brief point <e> <s> i entirely agree that the amendments should probably be rejected <e> <s> however at an earlier stage of the proceedings i expressed my views about some of the shortcomings of the present system of look-up tables <e> <s> the minister spelt out in some detail the positive case for them <e> <s> it is right to report that the secretary of state has invited the nraac to begin an inquiry into the best way to administer the system of monitoring including the use of look-up tables <e> <s> he has asked that we should start such an inquiry and that it should be carried forward by the nra <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene in this debate except briefly to pay tribute to the work of the committee <e> <s> like the noble lord lord moran i have read all the evidence and i was deeply impressed by the thoroughness with which the committee undertook its responsibilities <e>", "<cs> i intervene with particular pleasure to support my noble friend lord erroll of hale because i am a member of the aa committee of which he is a distinguished vice-president <e> <s> i wish to make a separate and specific point <e> <s> i am sure that many members of the committee have been involved in organising charity events of one kind or another <e> <s> the open garden scheme is a good example <e> <s> such schemes are almost entirely dependent upon signposts of the kind that we have been discussing <e> <s> i cannot think of anything more disastrous for those charities and organisations there are many others but i take the example of those who open gardens regularly than if they were deprived of the kind of signposting that is frequently done by the motoring organisations or if those charities had to pay the bill for that signposting <e> <s> it might make all the difference between a successful fund-raising effort and one that was uneconomic <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that during my time in parliament i have ever read a select committee report that impressed me more <e> <s> in this report we have what is almost certainly the most complete compendium of information practical experience and scientific knowledge on the subject of nitrates in water that exists anywhere <e> <s> the select committee report is likely to be the standard work for some time to come <e> <s> my noble friend lord middleton his colleagues on the committee and their advisers all deserve the warmest congratulation <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the ministerial signatories to the code of good practice issued by the department of agriculture in the early s which i believe has subsequently been amended perhaps i may ask my noble friend whether she is satisfied that the recommendations of the farm animal welfare council which are very important are being implemented with the necessary degree of urgency <e> <s> i appreciate that we have to carry europe with us on that point but the council made a number of extremely important recommendations <e> <s> will she pursue the matter with real vigour <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by declaring an interest as a director of associated british ports holdings <e> <s> soon after i became a director of that company and soon after the introduction of this bill that seems a long time ago now i paid my first visit to immingham <e> <s> at that time i found the existing locked port heavily congested <e> <s> one of the reasons that influenced the directors in introducing this bill was the need to get cargo out of that port and into the bulk handling facility where it was more appropriately handled <e> <s> that left the locked facility for cargo which was more suited for handling there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord radnor for enabling us to debate this important subject and to listen to such a spirited maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree with me that it is always wise to wait for all the facts before reaching conclusions <e> <s> however will he accept from me a former member of parliament for the area who used to live at st davids that local anxieties have been greatly magnified by the not very happy way in which the matter was handled initially which included the sending of a letter to the wrong member of parliament <e> <s> perhaps i may say how welcome it therefore is that the minister alan clark is now to address a public meeting at st davids <e> <s> i should like to ask that all information including the medical information and accurate information about the size and shape of the facility is made available so that those of us who are anxious about the matter can reach a judgment on fact and not on surmise <e>", "<cs> my lords because this important debate is being held on friday i have to make an apology <e> <s> i have interrupted long planned engagements to return to london but i am afraid that i will have to leave before the end of the debate something which i always try to avoid <e> <s> i shall of course read what is said <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will be aware that i am a director of associated british ports <e> <s> on this occasion i need detain the house for only a very short time <e> <s> after the clear and comprehensive speech of my noble friend lord geddes and the equally comprehensive summary of the select committees position by my noble friend lord thomas of gwydir there is indeed very little that remains to be said <e>", "<cs> in using that phrase with respect i was simply quoting from my noble friend the chairman of the select committee and the <e>", "<cs> my lords the precedent is that a private bill applying to a particular locality is to i be used as a means for controlling national policy on trade which is clearly the responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i am forced to rise because of the comment by the noble lord who suggests that this project is being built for coal <e> <s> i made it perfectly clear that the company is building it for a wide range of industrial and commercial uses <e> <s> i cannot allow that statement to stand without challenge <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene in the debate but as the noble lord has indicated that he will be pressing this amendment i feel that i must do so <e> <s> while listening to the discussion i have been asking myself whether his amendment actually adds anything to the powers available to regulators which is not already there <e> <s> i do not believe that it does although i may be missing something <e> <s> clause deals with the establishment of standards and objectives <e> <s> if we take for example the case of the national rivers authority of which noble lords will know i am chairman it is one of its duties over a period of time to establish objectives for river quality standards <e> <s> thereafter having set those objectives it has a duty to issue discharge consents in order that they may be achieved or to issue discharge consents this would meet the point made in the noble lords amendment in order to achieve reductions over a period of time <e>", "<cs> i agree that there are powers specifically written into the water act regarding the establishment of standards and objectives <e> <s> however as i read the bill clause enables the secretary of state to make regulations and not just regulations confined to water <e> <s> it is true that the nra will be able to write its conditions into the conditions issued to achieve the objectives set out here so far as concerns water <e> <s> but what i am a little puzzled about i ask this question out of a genuine sense of wanting to know what would be achieved by the noble lords objective is why his objective cannot be achieved perfectly satisfactorily under the present wording of clause <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene yet again but one of the matters of concern which arose while we were working out the relationship between the national rivers authority and her majestys inspectorate of pollution was the fact that the overwhelming majority of industrial processes are covered <e> <s> indeed we calculate that probably over per cent <e> <s> are covered <e> <s> of course it is always open to the secretary of state to add to that list <e> <s> i remain as unconvinced as i was earlier about the need for the noble lords amendment in order to achieve the objectives which i think we both share <e>", "<cs> i intended to intervene only briefly to make one point but i am prompted by the remarks of the noble lord lord parry to make one other observation namely that the difficulty about the arrangement which he describes is that it is the practice of ministers to refer all questions to the chairman of the appropriate body and it is the chairman who then answers by correspondence <e> <s> so in practice it takes the ability to cross-examine away from the chambers of both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> i do not see where the difficulty arises <e> <s> as the minister has said surely in order to bring any possible discharge into consideration it is necessary to have the widest possible definition <e> <s> under clause the secretary of state issues regulations which establish whether or not to apply the definition to a particular concentration <e> <s> he may well be guided by the ec regulations <e> <s> clause states specifically <e>", "<cs> as i endeavoured to be helpful to the government earlier this afternoon i hope that i shall not be thought malicious in posing a question that i should have asked some time ago <e> <s> it is a point that i should have noticed long ago perhaps <e> <s> one of the advantages of long sittings in the chamber is that one reads bills in more detail perhaps than one has done previously <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that explanation <e> <s> i noted what he said about the independent river purification authorities and their years experience <e> <s> i hope that he is not suggesting that the national rivers authority which is the largest independent environmental enforcement agency in europe is not equally qualified to look after the waters in england <e>", "<cs> i express my gratitude to the minister for so fully and comprehensively meeting an important point which i raised at second reading <e> <s> it is perhaps the most important point of outstanding anxiety about the operation of ipc jointly by the nra and hmip <e>", "<cs> i shall be extremely brief because the matter has been comprehensively covered by the noble lord lord moran <e> <s> this is an extremely important point <e> <s> i believe that in seeking to ensure that the bill did not go too wide the government have now created a situation where we can actually have serious pollution that should be prevented <e> <s> if my noble friend cannot give an immediately favourable answer tonight i trust that he will not close his mind to these issues <e> <s> i hope that he will take the matter away and see whether he can come back with a solution which would safeguard the environment as i am sure all members of the committee would wish and not leave us in a situation where we could face quite serious pollution that ought to be prevented <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the statement by the minister that he will reconsider the matter <e> <s> clearly there is a problem on disused sites where the ownership is not known <e> <s> there is an existing problem which is causing great difficulties in some areas where sites are having to be capped or treated because of pollution <e> <s> as i understand the bill where waste is being kept a licence has to be held <e> <s> where the ownership is known presumably the protection that is sought will be provided <e> <s> this is an extremely important matter because the potential pollution from these waste fill sites is so great <e> <s> the committee should look to the government for clarification on this matter at a later stage <e>", "<cs> the committee will recognise the fact that as chairman of the national rivers authority i am particularly pleased that the minister has agreed to take the amendment away and look at the wording <e> <s> in doing so i ask him to examine a couple of related matters to which i need not return when we reach clause <e> <s> clauses and are related <e> <s> clause j refers to publicity and public registers in regard to the exercise of any power under clause <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to take part in the debate <e> <s> i am prompted by the intervention we have just heard <e> <s> i declare an interest as director of a regional television company but also as a former secretary of state for wales who understands very well the pressure for regional advice and who lives in a world where we have committees looking at this and many other matters <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend for missing the first few moments of his speech <e> <s> i should at once declare an interest as i am a director of htv <e> <s> i shall be brief in what i have to say <e> <s> i almost entirely agree with everything that my noble friend said and also with the speech made by the noble lord lord boston of faversham <e>", "<cs> i am broadly sympathetic to the argument put forward by the noble baroness but i cannot resist rising to my feet when the company of which i am a director has been so freely referred to <e> <s> i am quite confident that if we are fortunate enough to regain our franchise i hope we shall be fortunate in that bidding exercise although some of us have anxieties on that score we shall continue to provide material from both cardiff and bristol <e> <s> i wish to inquire about a point of definition <e> <s> i must confess that i have not gone through the rest of the bill with great care to see whether there is some other part of it which answers the question i am about to raise <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a good deal of sympathy with what has been said about the amendments <e> <s> it was a little hard of the noble baroness lady white to blame the unfortunate welsh office for the actions of the parliamentary draftsmen who i suspect had probably had more to do with it than my old department <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene as chairman of the national rivers authority to say that i have some sympathy with the objective <e> <s> however it is only one step in a great many that will have to be taken <e> <s> it is worth using this opportunity to put on record the fact that we feel that there will be a need for a further look at the whole subject <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who spoke in the debate on this subject on the last occasion i express my warm appreciation to my noble friend for the thoroughness with which she has considered this issue and for the helpful way in which she has sought to meet the objections which were put forward <e> <s> i believe that it is a matter of considerable importance that the words and particularly have been removed because although the emphasis still lies on national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty the very fact that the words have been removed in the way that they have against the background of comment in this house will give a clear steer to the new organisation that its responsibilities apply elsewhere and to all the very beautiful countryside of wales wherever it may be <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while i do not share the views of those who think that the risk has disappeared from the world or that it is unseemly to have a defence installation near the holy place of st davids i am deeply sceptical of the view that it is impossible to consider a location that will do less environmental damage <e> <s> will he accept from me as one who was a local member of parliament and lived for a number of years less than a mile from the site that there is well justified concern at the serious damage that that siting would do to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene very briefly really for old times sake and partly because the minister referred to me in her speech <e> <s> she referred to the decision taken in to retain the traditional independence outside south pembrokeshire <e> <s> i well remember the issue coming before me <e> <s> of course i was the local member of parliament and i have reason to think that some of the inhabitants of caldey from time to time cast their votes for me although i must confess also that it was not the usual practice of candidates in an election campaign to make the crossing in order to win their votes <e> <s> it may be that my energetic successor has set new precedents in that respect <e>"]
