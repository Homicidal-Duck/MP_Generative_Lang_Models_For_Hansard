["<cs> my lords there is one great advantage in following my noble friend lord home of the hirsel that is that you can discard most of what you want to say because his wise and clear expression of the problem removes the necessity for you to try rather imperfectly to follow it <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether any use has ever been made of subsection of section of the act which provides for a special review in cases of glaring inconsistency <e> <s> this was recommended by a speakers conference in of which i was a member and so far as i know it has never been used <e> <s> i am sure that the time has come to review the whole of this system in order to get a fair and more democratic system of electing our members <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord nugent of guildford for giving us this opportunity of considering the williams report <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to him for the very clear and concise introduction he gave which covered the whole report <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate my successor in paternity of the house of commons the noble lord lord strauss who like me was engaged in the house on the subjects which the williams committee were considering <e> <s> i should like to assure him that whenever he takes part in our debates whether we agree or disagree with him we shall welcome his intervention <e>", "<cs> is my noble friend aware that some of the incidents portrayed relating to action by our forces both in northern ireland and in cyprus were extremely inaccurate and disappointed very many ex-servicemen who saw the programme and who had been in action in northern ireland and in cyprus <e> <s> may that be conveyed to the chairman of the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord walston on the volume of information that he has given to us in these four red books and for the clarity of expression both in the report and particularly in his opening speech this afternoon <e> <s> perhaps i should begin by making a reference to my history because when i was in the other place six years ago i made the judgment that it would not be in the interests of this country either economically or for its parliamentary sovereignty for it to be a member of the community <e> <s> that was some time ago and this house in particular took a different point of view <e> <s> i think now that we are in we have to try and make it work however difficult it is we have to forget our previous views on it <e> <s> no doubt some of the inconsistencies and absurdities that we saw six years ago still remain and it must be by aiming at those targets that we shall alter it <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give the figures on the number of producers <e> <s> they are rather different <e> <s> i was quoting the per cent <e> <s> of the french producers who would be exempted <e> <s> i wonder whether he has the figures on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not present at the committee stage i was away convalescing <e> <s> i should like now to put two points on this amendment <e> <s> first as to the north yorkshire moors my noble friend lord craigton talked about the loss of acres in the last years <e> <s> in fact if you go back in history a large proportion of this moorland was agricultural land and at the time of the napoleonic wars large parts of the north yorkshire moors were growing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord plowden has the happy gift of being able to extract clarity out of the confusion of some witnesses by a very courteous and penetrating examination and he has shown that quality today <e> <s> indeed i found his speech so clear that i thought i could throw away most of the notes for my speech because he had dealt with the subject clearly however not sufficiently clearly for the noble lord lord lever <e> <s> however i felt something was wrong in that one thing i thought he was not doing was creating any beehives of activity without honey and we were trying to reduce the number of honeyless beehives <e>", "<cs> may i come back to the point of this amendment <e> <s> at the present time the number of sex shops in this country is growing considerably and local authorities do not have the power to control that growth <e> <s> sex shops are a form of environmental pollution <e> <s> your lordships committee should give adequate powers to local authorities <e> <s> that seems to me to be the nub of the matter <e> <s> is the juvenile noble lord lord houghton of sowerby aware of what is happening that large sums of money are being made by the proprietors of these sex shops throughout the country <e> <s> it is our duty to give local authorities the power to control their numbers and location and whether we take the amendment moved by the noble earl lord halsbury or the governments amendments on the marshalled list is not the point <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate has thrown down a challenge which i think is a far stronger challenge than the one given by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby in his formal amendment <e> <s> i have been through this matter and i know the difficulties to which he alluded <e> <s> for years we have had a period during which there has been a large minority who have said that the right way to <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords it is my stupidity <e> <s> it is in my notes <e> <s> what the lord chief justice was saying is that there was a flood of written material that was causing young people to commit sexual crimes and i am sorry if i did not make that clear <e> <s> the williams committee said that they found the written word did not have that effect that it happens with pictorial representations but not with the written word <e> <s> i thought the conclusive evidence was what the learned lord chief justice said yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord obrien for his very clear brief and penetrating introduction to this motion <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate him on its timeliness the day before what will be a crucial meeting of the agriculture ministers <e> <s> in four days there is going to be a vital summit meeting at which this will be reported which will be more fortunate than has been the lot of the other reports on the future financing of the community <e> <s> we have here a trilogy <e> <s> we started off with the stuttgart report of the court of auditors which came out in october then the house of commons eec committee brought out in november the report on future financing and ours came out quite recently <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord obrien has with great clarity exposed the problems covered by this report <e> <s> those of us who served on the sub-committee i know would wish me to pay tribute to the unfailing courtesy and the penetrating wisdom that he used when he occupied the chair <e> <s> having been over this course four times i have come to know some of the fences particularly the rather awesome water jump additionality <e> <s> it has perhaps left me rather like my noble friend lady carnegy with some misgivings about the european regional development fund <e> <s> coming straight to the water jump the principle of additionality was meant as a safeguard against reimbursement of national budgetary expenditure <e> <s> it is quite incapable of proof and may be inclined in fact to encourage evasive tactics in certain of the member states <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the debate there is a great danger of undue repetition <e> <s> i just want to say to your lordships that i am worried and troubled over this report <e> <s> it is written with exceptional clarity <e> <s> it deals in some detail with the medical and the legal issues but it seems to neglect entirely the effect of the committees recommendations on the child who is brought into the world by the techniques they recommend and also the effect on the family in which that child is brought up <e>", "<cs> as an ex-parliamentary secretary of the ministry perhaps i may congratulate the government on their decision to remove the very obscure and unpopular married womens half test <e> <s> however i should like the government to explain in some detail exactly what is involved in this provision <e> <s> it appears that it is retroactive from only nd december <e> <s> there are very many married women who were serving overseas after the war who were quite ignorant of the married womens half test and who have been fighting to get a retirement pension for many years <e> <s> how will they be affected by the decision <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble lord lord stallard who has just spoken will the minister give an explanation of the difference on the taxation side <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this amendment from the point of view of archives but i should like to ask my noble friend three questions <e> <s> i shall keep them short <e> <s> first i do not think this house has realised that some of the archives in yorkshire are in fact the property of the yorkshire archaeological society <e> <s> at the present time they are looked after by the west yorkshire metropolitan county council and an amount of a year is paid <e> <s> i should like to ask what will happen to that agreement which was made in after abolition date and how far this particular amendment will affect that <e>", "<cs> my lords are not the figures for the increase in bank credit and money supply disturbing when compared with the annual increase in output of per cent <e> <s> will my noble friend have a look at this as suggested by the noble lord lord beswick and have an inquiry made into how money and credit come into circulation and the consequent burden of the increase in our national debt as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is greatly indebted to the noble lord lord beswick for initiating the debate and not only for that but for the great clarity with which he expressed his mind in dealing with what is a very complicated problem <e> <s> i have no doubt myself about how complicated it is <e>", "<cs> my lords just over years ago i started a stint as parliamentary secretary in the ministry of national insurance <e> <s> listening to the debate i thought how shocked i should have been had i realised in that we had to wait years before we had a comprehensive review of the national insurance scheme <e> <s> i congratulate my noble friend lady trumpington and her minister on having undertaken the rather hazardous task of reviewing the scheme <e> <s> ministers come and ministers go and they all add little complications to the scheme <e> <s> there is a great need for simplification but it has its dangers <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble baroness has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment although i am dissatisfied with the decision <e>", "<cs> i share the great concern that there is about article <e> <s> i do not follow what my noble friend the minister has said <e> <s> the select committee on the delegation of powers is only half way through its consideration <e> <s> in its report it said that it was a difficult <e>", "<cs> does my noble friend not agree that this is an interim report <e> <s> an interim report is followed by a final report <e> <s> all her quotations are to that extent limited until the final report occurs <e> <s> it is no good <e>", "<cs> my lords is not my noble friend aware that this matter has been discussed for a very long time and procedure committees certainly of the house of commons have made recommendations to lessen the burden <e> <s> will my right honourable friend consider that the time has come when the procedure committees of the two houses should meet together to consider ways in which this overburden can be reduced <e>", "<cs> i do not share the view of the noble lord lord bruce of donington on this particular amendment because i believe this is an attempt by the dooge committee to get a genuinely free internal market in the community <e> <s> certainly when i was opposing the accession of britain to the community years ago it was my aim then to create a large free trading area in europe and not to belong to a protectionist body such as the common market suggested <e> <s> those of us who fought the bill years ago were trying to get a wider european free trade area <e> <s> those of us who were thinking in those terms were trying to get in the north atlantic treaty a provision for greater economic co-operation <e> <s> we were defeated <e> <s> we felt that joining the community would destroy many of the advantages and a great deal of the sovereignty of the british parliament <e> <s> but because we believed in that when the decision was taken we accepted that decision and our efforts will always be to try to mitigate the disadvantages that have arisen to britain and the community from our accession <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what my noble friend lord reay has just said i wonder whether when my noble friend the minister winds up she could give us a picture of what progress the other contracting parties have made towards ratification <e> <s> there were four contracting parties which made declarations saying that they could not accept certain of the articles <e> <s> in fact in their declarations they were introducing the very amendments to the bill which my noble friend said were impossible <e> <s> i think that we should have that information before we pass this bill because we have been pressed both here and in another place to deal with the bill very quickly <e> <s> fortunately we do not have a guillotine in this house but in my time in the other place i have found no parallel of a constitutional bill being guillotined except when we passed the european communities bill in <e> <s> i shall leave that matter because i do not want to be contentious today <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i should like to congratulate the noble lords who formed the working group on the clarity and common sense of their recommendations <e> <s> i pick out just two points where i think the clarity is very important <e> <s> first one dealing with the revised guide which is mentioned in paragraph of the report <e> <s> as one who served under successive speakers and chairmen of ways and means for years in the commons i found it very puzzling when i came here to try and enjoy the freedom and flexibility of self-regulation <e> <s> but the longer i stay here the more i am certain that it is a better procedure than that of the discipline of the speaker <e> <s> it will be a great help if the procedure committee are allowed to pursue this matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson seems to think we can do it ourselves without their help <e> <s> it would be a great thing i think if every member each session gets a revised copy of the guide <e> <s> no doubt the <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not as the noble lord lord ennals rightly said a party issue <e> <s> nor is it a national issue <e> <s> when i was minister of health the first paper that came on my desk was the guillebaud report which lain macleod had initiated <e> <s> for the record it is interesting to remember the remit of the guillebaud report <e> <s> it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for giving me the opportunity first although i did not expect it to listen to the recollections of the noble lord lord bruce of donington going back some years and secondly as the oldest surviving minister of health in the country to offer my congratulations to the youngest minister who has just taken over the post and who has produced this large library of documents through which we have been looking <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now well on our way towards the end of the list of speakers <e> <s> i shall confine my remarks to one point <e> <s> i am a little unhappy about the system of committees and the authority under this bill <e> <s> we have heard very little about it today <e> <s> i feel that for this bill to work properly and i am anxious that it should there should be a blend of the authority of the ethical experts as well as the scientific and medical experts <e> <s> that was not mentioned by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i hope that the point will be covered by my noble friend when she winds up the debate later tonight <e>"]
