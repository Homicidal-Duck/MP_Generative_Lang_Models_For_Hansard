practice <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very gratifying that so many members of the house of lords should be concerned about the conditions and the welfare of employees in local government <e> <s> it should be so <e> <s> i hope that the minister has taken note of that fact and in due course will ensure that the government are generous in the way they treat these employees <e> <s> this discussion shows further evidence that this is a thoroughly bad bill one that ought never to have been presented to this house or to the country <e>", "<cs> my lords as one concerned with the original negotiations on the general agreement on tariffs and trade may i ask the minister whether he does not agree that there has been a drift away from policies consistent with the gatt principles <e> <s>

for me to follow the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e> <s> when he was in the diplomatic service he assisted me as the minister in concluding a successful trade agreement with yugoslavia following

particularly for raising this subject for discussion today <e>", "<cs> my lords it affords me much pleasure to follow the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> when i was chairman of the select committee on race relations in the other place she gave me very valuable assistance in helping the committee to produce a unanimous report <e> <s> on that committee was the present secretary of state
