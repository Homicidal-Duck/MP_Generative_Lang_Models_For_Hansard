["<cs> my lords i welcome the oppportunity to make my maiden speech in this house on the theme of industry year <e> <s> i do so first for the personal reason that i began my working life in a major company in the field of electronic engineering <e> <s> i was part of a research team exploring the properties of silicon as a semi-conductor <e> <s> little did we realise then the amazing extent of those properties and the revolution that was to follow their discovery <e> <s> more importantly i welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate because the origins of industry year lie in part in a series of consultations held at st georges house the conference centre associated with the dean and chapter of st georges chapel windsor castle so one of the seeds which blossomed as industry year was first sown in ecclesiastical ground <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no personal experience which equips me to contribute to this debate <e> <s> i do so because the debate is about a calamitous conflict with a religious dimension <e> <s> it is not primarily a religious conflict but a political one between the state of isreal whose overriding need arising from the history of the jewish people is for security and the arab nations and communities united by a desire for territory for the palestinian arabs <e>", "<cs> as i seek to express a view from the episcopal benches on this amendment i am aware of the complexity of the issues with which we are dealing <e> <s> as a christian i am profoundly convinced of the wrongness of surrogacy <e> <s> i would find it difficult to go entirely with the argument that there can never be interference with the processes of divine creation <e> <s> i would feel that there are occasions on which that divine process may be facilitated by human means <e> <s> nevertheless in this particular case i feel that the separation of genetic parenthood from physiological motherhood is damaging to the integrity of the family and quite possibly damaging to the mother who has to carry the child <e>", "<cs> in view of the remarks of the noble baroness perhaps i may venture a statement on the biblical sources which were put to me earlier by the noble earl the minister <e> <s> when i refer to the complexity of the issues among those complexities was the ambivalence of the biblical sources <e> <s> it is indeed the case that one could argue that a form of surrogacy took place in the arrangements between abraham and his slave in view of the barrenness of sarah <e>", "<cs> my lords i share with other noble lords the sense of gratitude which they have already expressed to the noble viscount lord buckmaster for bringing this question before your lordships house this evening <e> <s> the noble viscounts lord buckmaster and lord falkland have both already stressed the place of the christian churches in the history and affairs of uganda <e> <s> church and nation have grown together in this country <e> <s> it therefore seems right that a member of the episcopal bench in your lordships house should make a contribution to this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords my researches in <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the privileges of speaking in your lordships house is that one is able to share in debates with those who speak with great authority and experience <e> <s> the noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl lord halsbury for his clear exposition of the bill <e> <s> i am a layman in matters medical and legal but it is clear as the warnock committee said that there are moral dimensions to the whole matter of surrogacy <e> <s> at the same time it is difficult to discover just how those moral dimensions should be expressed <e> <s> we live in a society where there are a variety of values by no means all of them shared and even within the church there are sometimes differing viewpoints on a particular moral problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the diocese of ripon of which i am bishop has within it great extremes of rural and urban neighbourhoods <e> <s> at one extreme are the high moorlands of the yorkshire pennines as wild and remote as anything in england <e> <s> it is possible to live over miles from a secondary school and nearly miles from the local hospital <e> <s> coming down from the moors one encounters first the villages and market towns of james herriot country then the commuter villages near the great urban areas and finally the suburbs residential neighbourhoods and estates and the inner city wards of the city of leeds at the opposite extreme from the remote and distant hills <e>", "<cs> my lords in the unavoidable absence of the right reverend prelate the bishop of london who is chairman of the churches main committee i should like to bring to the attention of your lordships an aspect of this bill as it <e>", "<cs> my lords from the episcopal benches i shall add a word of thanks to the noble viscount lord whitelaw for all he has done in the house <e> <s> we have appreciated enormously the work that he has done as leader of the house <e> <s> i have appreciated the friendship that he has given to so many members of the house not least to myself <e> <s> i am sorry that he is no longer to be leader of the <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me enormous pleasure to follow the noble lord lord jakobovits in this debate and to have the opportunity to offer on behalf of your lordships house our congratulations to him on a notable maiden speech <e> <s> he has been for over years the chief rabbi of the hebrew congregations of the united kingdom and the commonwealth <e> <s> during that time he has been an outstanding religious leader of moral conviction and high principle <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for introducing the amendment and for commenting that it is a complex bill <e> <s> it is reassuring for one who is not a lawyer to learn that <e> <s> as i try to find my way around its complexities i am glad to know that others also do not find it entirely straightforward <e>", "<cs> i am finding a little difficulty in following the minister because i do not see from where this new category comes <e> <s> the wording of the amendment states that <e>", "<cs> my understanding of this amendment is similar to that of the noble lord lord bonham-carter that it concerns the right of appeal <e> <s> i understood from the speech of the minister on second reading that there was a possibility that certain groups of people could be excepted from the effects of the immigration bill as it stands and of the removal of the power to appeal <e> <s> but i also understood that it was likely that such groups would be those who were asylum seekers or refugees <e>", "<cs> i was delighted to hear the support of the noble lord lord renton for the amendment <e> <s> i should like to expand on one point which was made by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones in commending the amendment <e> <s> it relates to the circumstances pertaining to the country from which a refugee may have come <e> <s> those circumstances may change very quickly and it may sometimes be rather difficult to know exactly what they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the introduction of this bill into your lordships house by the noble duke and i hope that your lordships will resist the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e>", "<cs> my lords the commitment of her majestys government to the preservation of peace with freedom and justice articulated in the gracious speech must surely be welcome by all in your lordships house <e> <s> uppermost in our minds as we reflect upon that peace must be the astonishing events in eastern europe events which continue to surprise and move us daily <e> <s> but there are other areas of the world where the course of events continues to trouble us <e> <s> it is about two such areas that i should like to speak this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with some reluctance to intervene in consideration of the question before your lordships house this evening <e> <s> i have no first-hand experience of life in south africa <e> <s> however noble lords might expect a contribution from the episcopal bench not least because of the involvement of the churches in south africa in social and economic affairs in the urban areas of that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add from these benches a further tribute to those which have already been paid to the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> other noble lords have already paid homage to his skill as a parliamentarian <e> <s> i wish to underline that skill and also to mention my own sense of great gratitude for the noble lords unfailing courtesy to every member of the house <e> <s> he was certainly courteous to me and to others on these benches <e> <s> we have been profoundly grateful for the way he has always taken the care and the trouble to talk to each one of us and to help us <e> <s> we wish him well in his new office
