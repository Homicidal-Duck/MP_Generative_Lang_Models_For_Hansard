second reading of a largely technical measure as brief as possible and to avoid both now and in my wind-up remarks referring to the wider questions affecting the armed forces as a result of the statement made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state the the other day about which we are to have a debate on th july <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords two of the andover aircraft currently used by the queens flight entered the royal air force service in september and the third in march <e>", "<cs> my lords having supplied the figure of up to i should like to add that i shall be dealing with the question of ballistic missile defences in the nineties which is what we shall be talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords investigations into whether scorpion engines have been illegally exported from this country have been in progress for some time <e> <s> it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage of the inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say no to my noble friend <e> <s> i am satisfied that the type submarine design currently being developed by british shipbuilders will meet the royal navys operational and programme requirements at a reasonable cost <e>", "<cs> my lords the response to the loan guarantee scheme has been very encouraging <e> <s> in the four months since the scheme came into operation guarantees have been issued in respect of million-worth of bank lending <e> <s> that includes million of lending to new businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of a specific request in the terms which my noble friend has used but the us government is clear that ships allocated to the standby squadron will be declared to nato and will be adequately maintained for the purpose <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> in any case the quotation taken out of context does not accurately reflect the late lord mountbattens view on nuclear deterrence <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of noble lords have made the point that foreign affairs and defence encompass a very wide area and that one days debate of speakers does neither justice to the debate indeed the noble lord lord shinwell suggested that it should be called a deliberation or a series of deliberations nor as some sympathetic noble lords opposite have pointed out does it give the minister answering the debate any real possibility of answering the many very important and very interesting contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion in the name of the noble baroness lady david which she introduced actually asks us <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i do not believe that any further inquiry would be useful <e> <s> the noble earl and his unofficial committee saw my honourable friend the under-secretary of state for defence procurement mr geoffrey pattie on th may and were informed that the government did not believe that there was any fresh evidence which justified changing any of the conclusions of the inquiry carried out by my honourable friend and tabled in this house on st october <e>", "<cs> my lords the industry act forecast estimates that competitiveness measured by relative unit labour costs has improved over per cent <e> <s> this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the noble lord lord noel-baker who introduced the debate for an extremely interesting debate <e> <s> it is with reluctance that it is my duty to resist some part of his passionate idealism with which so many of us agree <e> <s> as my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence has said defence may be expensive but war is enormously more expensive <e> <s> in the world in which we live as opposed to the desirable world which the noble lord lord noel-baker would like us to live in we must maintain the peace <e> <s> this currently means maintaining deterrence against potential aggressors <e> <s> nevertheless we support fully the sentiments that have been expressed in the debate towards arms control and disarmament on a multilateral basis and supported by practical verification <e>", "<cs> my lords the terms strategic used to describe those nuclear weapons systems defined as such in the strategic arms limitation agreements and theatre covering all other land-based nuclear forces have been used generally in the past <e> <s> it is preferable to talk in terms of range wherever possible and i therefore welcome president reagans decision to describe the current negotiations in geneva as dealing with intermediate range nuclear forces <e> <s> but while i have considerable sympathy with the thought expressed in the question the terms strategic and theatre have come to have well-understood meanings and they will still inevitably be widely used <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will allow me to make a very quick interruption to say that the document written by the unofficial committee mentioned by the noble earl on the errors and omissions from the working groups report is their views on the situation <e> <s> i shall comment both in my speech and to the noble earl on what our views are in relation to their assertions about the working group report <e>", "<cs> my lords the results of the last three cbi quarterly industrial trends surveys taken together indicate some modest strengthening of business confidence <e> <s> this together with the rise in output since the second quarter of especially in manufacturing industry suggests that a gradual recovery in economic activity is under way <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already made clear to the house the use by the united states in an emergency of bases in the united kingdom including those on which cruise missiles will be based would be a matter for joint decision between the two governments in the light of circumstances at the time <e> <s> these arrangements have existed for nearly years and have been supported by successive governments <e> <s> it would not be in the

the policy regarding deductions from pay was promulgated <e>", "<cs> my lords the total cost of the programme for payment to the united states government and industry is expected to be of the order of million <e> <s> the major part of the expenditure will be in us dollars <e> <s> the purpose of equipping polaris with new motors is to ensure that the weapon system remains effective until the polaris force is replaced by trident <e> <s> the government believe that trident remains the best and most cost-effective option to ensure that the united kingdom retains an independent strategic nuclear capability well into the twenty-first century <e> <s> we have therefore no intention of cancelling the trident programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord shinwell will understand my difficulties in attempting to answer this question <e> <s> much depends on what assumptions one makes about the nature and intensity of the aggression we would face <e> <s> it is worth noting that in the early years of the second world war expenditure was of the order of per cent <e> <s> of national income <e> <s> with todays much more powerful and sophisticated weaponry i would imagine the figure could be even higher <e> <s> this contrasts with our present defence budget of around per cent <e> <s> of the gross domestic product <e> <s> it is obvious that if we failed in our aim of deterring aggression and preserving the security of our peoples the cost to the nation would be enormous <e>", "<cs> my lords the target profit rate for non-competitive defence contracts in was per cent <e> <s> on capital employed <e> <s> the same rate currently remains in force in line with the recommendation contained in the last report in from the independent review board for government contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government are obviously concerned about the rise in unemployment throughout the country as a result of the worldwide recession and the necessary restructuring of the british economy to deal with our longstanding industrial decline <e> <s> the economy of west london has in fact suffered less than many parts of the country and as the recession passes west london should be strongly placed to capitalise on the upturn <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will repeat a statement being made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence in the other place <e> <s> the statement runs as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the panorama statements to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> in my answer to the noble lord lord

the noble lord lord beswick for the contributions they have made in the pursuit of the noble earls unstarred question <e> <s> they have both been studying these questions far longer than i have and

currently again reviewing the whole question of the organisation of both the queens flight and no <e> <s> squadron and other matters arising out of last julys defence review with the object of economising to the greatest possible extent in what we perhaps loosely term the support and logistic areas of the royal air force in order to be able to afford what we need in the frontline <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> my noble friend has listened to the vast majority of the debate and will i know read the speeches that he has been unable to hear <e> <s> most noble lords have been brief and extremely constructive in their support of the stand that the government are taking against this shameful act of aggression <e> <s> we welcome the understanding of the noble lord lord shackleton that my noble friend and my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence must be allowed to plan their steps and take their diplomatic steps backed by the movement of armed forces in their own way and without disclosure <e> <s> i have to say to the noble lord the leader of the opposition that that has to be my answer to his detailed qusetions about the ascension islands or any other detailed disposition we may be making <e>", "<cs> my lords the government subscribe to natos strategy of flexible response as have successive governments over recent years <e> <s> this strategy is designed to prevent the outbreak of war either nuclear or conventional between nato and the warsaw pact <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to be able to say that the encouraging response to the loan guarantee scheme has been maintained <e> <s> in the months since this scheme came into operation guarantees have been issued in respect of million of bank lending <e> <s> this includes million of lending to new businesses <e> <s> a preliminary review of the schemes operation to date is being carried out at present <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was kind enough to send

south atlantic <e> <s> the treatment of the cost will of course take into account the need to maintain our defence in all other respects <e> <s> decisions on the treatment of cost are not appropriate at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords under the licensing arrangements in operation prior to the invasion spares ordered direct from industry would not be monitored by the ministry of defence <e>

believe that most visitors gain a clearer understanding of the nature and importance of information technology from their visits which should lead to an increasing determination to seek the benefits
