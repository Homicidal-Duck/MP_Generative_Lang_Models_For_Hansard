["<cs> my lords does the noble earl not agree that there is one group of children who cannot be transferred to ordinary schools namely those children who are both mentally and physically handicapped <e> <s> in view of the existence of the remarkable teaching staff who are trained to help such afflicted children will the minister ensure that they are in some way helped and that we in no way dodge responsibility by having them transferred to ordinary schools <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that it might be worthwhile recommending to the minister responsible for sport that he should have a conversation with the supporters of clubs in the rugby union and rugby league as despite the boisterousness and toughness of the game hooliganism hardly seems to occur at any rugby football ground <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not agree that the appalling and terrible machinations which were organised against the jewish people occurred in europe that some of our allies were desperately involved in that horrendous affair and that not many arabs were in any way concerned <e> <s> would the noble baroness not further agree that the government should be prepared to consider that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his reply <e> <s> is he aware that what he told the house on th march in answer to my supplementary question to lord diamonds question is quite inaccurate and that there were criticisms of the tax price index from the institute of fiscal studies the tuc the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i agree with him that all forms of indexing are a tax but i have said that was not his view on th march <e> <s> he did not recognise any criticism of that <e> <s> i welcome his conversion which should be to the benefit of us all <e> <s> is he further aware that the index does not reflect the loss of social wages or what it has meant for millions of ordinary people to lose various local government services <e> <s> examples are oap luncheon clubs and the fact that national health prescription charges are going up and old people will not be able to have nhs spectacles in the future <e> <s> all these things are very important to ordinary poor people in our community and i submit that they are worthy of better consideration from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord now make some endeavour this afternoon in this house to respond to the very important question which i put on behalf of millions of people who form the poorer section of the community in great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join others of your lordships house who have proffered congratulations to the noble lord lord forte <e> <s> i know how he feels <e> <s> he made a good maiden speech which we all enjoyed <e> <s> deep down i am sure he is glad that it is over and i hope he will understand when i say to him that because of his massive experience we are expecting to hear a great deal from him in the future which i am sure will be very enjoyable and informative for us all <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord tell us what has been achieved by implementing his proposals in south africa by not being prepared to play with another human being with the majority of the members of the british empire being recognised as coloured people <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not agree that after nuclear weapons bacteriological and chemical weapons are probably the most hideous and deadly weapons still left in the armoury of a not particularly sane mankind <e> <s> the endeavours of this government in seeking to get a complete ban are to be applauded <e> <s> does the noble baroness further agree that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly say a word of thanks on behalf of the various associations for the disabled and indeed for the disabled themselves for the magnificent support i had from this side of the house and for the generous response from the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords are the noble lord and the person opposite who giggled aware that a whole range of professional people in the national health service from the british medical association right the way through to the confederation of health service employees will be somewhat distressed by the curt reply that their request will not even be considered by the government <e> <s> it was not a demand <e> <s> it was simply to ask whether this really humane request would be considered <e> <s> is the minister aware that all those i have <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble minister aware that it is perfectly true to say that there are some disagreements apropos the extent of unemployment real and unemployment threatened right the way through from state enrolled nurses to state certified midwives junior doctors and consultants <e> <s> the situation varies from one rha to another and different figures are being given <e> <s> therefore would the noble lord agree that the wise thing to do would be to have this inquiry certainly not for my sake and not so much even for the sake of the associations but for the sake of the patients and the people who provide and serve our great national health service so that patients will not suffer in future <e> <s> which is what will happen if we do not examine the alleged increasing rate of unemployment of all grades in the national health service <e> <s> could we not reach a sensible agreement to have a national inquiry into the real extent and danger of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter is very important to doctors nurses midwives and to the patients about whom hope the government are concerned <e> <s> in so far as the minister has tried but could not by his own admission give the necessary facts and figures on the questions that were put to him this afternoon surely the realistic course to follow would be to engage in a sensible collaboration between all those involved to estimate the real danger of unemployment in this great service <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the answer which he gave to my noble friend will be very welcome indeed to those of us who have been involved with and know about through local government the tragedies which afflict the house-bound and old people simply because they do not have enough money to keep warm in an english winter <e> <s> it must be a terrible disgrace to our society <e> <s> when this information is to hand will the noble earl make sure that it is not spoilt by cut-backs in local government whose social service officers find out from those who are house-bound and old the ones who are in need of assistance to keep warm <e> <s> because the alternative is that these old people will die <e>", "<cs> my lords they were not my fears that i was speaking of but the fears of doctors sisters nurses and consultants <e> <s> they were the fears that they <e>", "<cs> my lords what i submitted was that there have been a number of instances where the medical profession know full well that people have suffered the side effects of drugs <e> <s> i am simply appealing that in the name of all decency and of civilised behaviour we do not want another episode like thalidomide <e> <s> ask any mother who has had a thalidomide child and she would be on my side <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say whether in any advance in the technological field be it from the new blood scheme or from any other scheme or advancement the government are seized of the frightening dilemma that the introduction of new technology may sometimes be advancement for the few and unemployment for the many <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister not agree that even those who support the fact that cruise missiles ought to be on this island of ours are nevertheless quite genuinely apprehensive that accidents could happen <e> <s> they are equally apprehensive about what might happen if a cruise missile were deliberately launched <e> <s> there would no doubt be retaliation and what would happen then <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that they will in no way agree that they will not be the first to use a nuclear missile <e> <s> so what the minister has just said is directly contrary to what has been said by the prime minister and the secretary of state for defence in another place <e>"]
