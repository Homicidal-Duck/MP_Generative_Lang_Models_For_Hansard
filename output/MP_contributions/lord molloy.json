["<cs> my lords like previous speakers i too should like to offer my thanks and congratulations to the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow and his committee for the production of this very valuable report <e> <s> indeed i am bound to say that anybody who cares to take the trouble to look at anything which the european community does is worthy of full support because the community needs watching day and night and at any other period that might exist <e> <s> when one looks at this report and reads of some of the absurdities and of the contemptible waste that goes on in that organisation it is bad enough when it hurts us but when they endeavour to do things on the one hand and then cut their own throats on the other i wish they would do it successfully one can understand why ordinary people in this country get very annoyed <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships house will bear with me for just a moment <e> <s> i want to explain why i have risen at this time of night to comment on this clause <e> <s> i have been very closely involved with men who almost since the creation of the commission have devoted their lives to building the forests of great britain <e> <s> they have no particular desire to own any one tree for themselves <e> <s> they have devoted their lives many of them for as many as or years to building up our forests not to building up any particular firm foreign or british or a mixture of both <e> <s> they have devoted their lives to building up the forests of great britain and there is a ministry responsible for the administration once again not of any particular firm or multinational <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the noble lord lord morris has earned himself a great distinction today <e> <s> he is probably the only man in this country who really believes that the present government have not set about deliberately creating unemployment <e> <s> but i want to say that while there are issues that might divide either side of your lordships house with regard to public ownership and private enterprise i would have thought that this amendment would appeal to the noble earl because whatever system either side of this house wants to adopt what both want to see i feel sure is that british industry gains from it <e> <s> i am so pleased that the noble earl nods his head because if that is so i cannot see how he can resist this amendment which proposes that irrespective of whether it is carried on by british telecom or whether british private entrepreneurs come in there will be a safety valve the safety valve being that the secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl allow me to interrupt him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> surely he must understand that when one talks about a british publicly-owned industry whether it be british telecom or the national coal board or the steel corporation there is massive support from private endeavour <e> <s> very many private industry endeavours depend on their parent the publicly-owned industry <e> <s> their competition and their earnestness is as decent and sincere as anyone elses within the private or publicly-owned sector <e> <s> therefore i beg the noble earl to bear that in mind as well <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble baroness has noted one important fact <e> <s> i have a great deal of sympathy with her in the submission that she made but the amendment as i read it does say <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> may i ask her whether she is aware that the ambulancemen have shown exceedingly great patience <e> <s> as long ago as there was the miller report <e> <s> this was followed in by the mccarthy report which recommended the rationalisation of the ambulance service proper training and proper qualifications and a sane system of collective bargaining <e> <s> in the clegg report recommended an all-in salary covering weekend work in precisely the same was as it affects firemen and the police <e> <s> in so far as ambulance staffs are a vital part of our emergency services what the ambulance staffs are asking for and what they have waited for for nearly four years is that the treatment meted out to them should be as near as possible to the conditions meted out to their colleagues in the police force and the fire service <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the ambulance staffs there are ambulancewomen as well as ambulancemen are highly skilled and very important people <e> <s> when there is a fire they may be without the police but the ambulance staffs are always there <e> <s> if there is a riot or a severe police problem ambulance staffs are required <e> <s> the point is that the co-ordination of these three services is admirable and i give credit to all three of them <e> <s> is the minister aware that on th of this month the secretary of state issued a press statement in which he made certain remarks concerning pay <e> <s> if he means them the confederation of health service employees which represents the ambulancemen are prepared from this moment onwards to meet him because they believe that this is the first time he has made them and that they represent a real basis for negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords great play has been made of the need for directly elected members of the european parliament <e> <s> therefore why should not the british be entitled to the pledge that they should have the right wherever they are to cast their votes and why should we be left outside on a promise that was given <e> <s> i believe that it is the responsibility of our government to see that it is honoured <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that the british pharmaceutical society support this proposal and that it is agonising enough to be on the dole without having to go through certain agonising bureaucratic methods to get a little more money to make ends meet <e> <s> will he not be prepared to take this back and reconsider his reply for the sake of the many millions who are on the dole as the result of his governments appalling economic policies <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am asking for this concession for those of our fellow countrymen and countrywomen who are out of work on the dole and perhaps stricken with disease or illness or accident <e> <s> i am asking that this nation hold out a helping hand in their time of need <e> <s> would he not be prepared even now to reconsider his reply and give a helping hand to those who have no work but wish to work and who in addition to being unemployed are stricken with illness disease or accident <e> <s> can he not give a more humanitarian reply and concentrate on the word consider in the question so that this proposal is at least considered <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the leader of the house a few questions <e> <s> were the terms of reference of this inquiry agreed with the trade unions and was the choice of chairman and other members of the inquiry agreed with the trade unions <e> <s> would he not agree that ultimately there may have to be some arbitration in future disputes or disagreements from this inquiry and therefore would it not be a very good thing in order to create the ideal atmosphere that the present dispute should now be referred to arbitration while this inquiry is sitting <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord the leader of the house agree that to set this inquiry into proper perspective and gain the confidence of the civil service which i know he desires it would be in the interests of all concerned to settle the present dispute through the time-honoured method of arbitration <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that it would be a very sad day for this house or for any other part of the united kingdom if we took for a yardstick what we could only ask in moscow <e> <s> is the noble lord also not aware that according to recent public opinion polls there seems to be a considerable majority of ordinary people who desire that these hideous weapons should be banished and outlawed <e> <s> would it not therefore be a good thing if the government of our country were to take a lead in this matter and for a start make very certain that no other power should have their hideous weapons based on this island <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the foreign secretary not agree that there is consternation in the house this afternoon apropos this matter <e> <s> despite the figures that he has read out and his reference to a matter of principles and priorities is there not a danger that whoever provided him with those figures may have fallen into the trap of knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that when the world was confronted with the horrendous problem of unemployment in the thirties the then united states president franklin delano roosevelt accepted the policies and philosophies of maynard keynes and kenneth galbraith which were based simply on spend and prosper <e> <s> by adopting <e>", "<cs> my lords when he speaks of the world having moved on years would the noble lord not agree that his government are pursuing a policy of adam smith <e> <s> the noble lord is really saying that it is better to keep nearly million people out of work and pay them something rather than to have them gainfully employed keeping their dignity and making a contribution to our nation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that having examined this situation many of us are of the opinion that it has been a bureaucratic decision taken in brussels or somewhere on the continent which blatently descriminates against british citizens <e> <s> it is pointless simply to keep an eye on discrimination <e> <s> what the noble lord should be assuring the house is that he intends to eliminate it on behalf of the british people <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that with the massive whitley machinery that exists if this house started indulging in trying to adjudicate every individual case of every civil servant irrespective of grade it would be taking on a mammoth task <e> <s> does the noble lord the leader of the house not also agree that perhaps the centre of this grievance is not so much the increase of pay which civil servants require but the fact that they feel aggrieved because their case has not been referred to arbitration for an independent judgment <e> <s> furthermore does the noble lord agree and i am sure he will that by and large we have an extraordinarily fine civil service and if this house were to become involved in any petty indulgences against them it would do two things it would deny the great freedoms that we claim for this country and it would exacerbate an already nasty situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply and encouraged by the fact that the lower income groups might stand a better chance of relief from the pain and suffering that everyone endures when there is an illness in a family <e> <s> may i please ask the noble lord whether he would not agree that after the most fearful war in world history this nation created a completely free national health service which became part and parcel of the texture <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that very brave and courageous reply which is about as far from the truth as sydney is from london but it was not a bad effort <e> <s> what some noble peers will do for their party is amazing <e> <s> does not the noble earl realise that the policies of the present government are debasing the conditions of life for millions of our fellow countrymen and that if the government pursue such policies that will continue to be the effect <e> <s> is the noble earl really not aware of the horrible social tensions that this policy has created <e> <s> is he not aware that there is a smell of decay throughout this island <e>", "<cs> it is a a good one too my lords <e> <s> outraged unemployed youth is reacting <e> <s> do the government know that silent degradation will produce no response and that the only way to overcome all these problems is at least to follow some of the proposals of the right honourable gentleman the leader of the opposition <e> <s> which i believe both sides of industry and all thinking men would approve <e> <s> should not the government at least consider that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that if next week we could return to the level of unemployment and the rate of inflation left by the labour government to the incoming government that would mean a massive improvement in the economic situation of the country <e> <s> that is what that would mean <e> <s> bearing in mind that there now seems to be a permanent crisis which is creating bewilderment for people on both sides of industry does not the noble earl realise that while perhaps he cannot go all the way in accepting the proposals enunciated by the leader of the opposition there are people on both sides of industry in all walks of life who believe that something along those lines should now be adopted before our nation gets deeper and deeper into the slough of despond created by the tory government <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that the question itself is indicative of the appalling situation into which the present administration has got this country <e> <s> would he not further agree that his answer confirms that and is it not the fact of the matter that what we have to do and it is a possibility is create jobs that is take the unemployed and give them work to do which they want to do <e> <s> they want to earn a living not to be dished out with money on the dole and if we were to follow the policies which have been enunciated by the leader of the opposition and by well-known economists this could be achieved and our nation could be saved <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be prepared to take on board the other side of the problem when people wish to make appeals against planning decisions tenants associations and such like but discover that they cannot afford to do it and therefore the local authority wins hands down <e> <s> would he not consider the possibility of aiding such local voluntary organisations which wish to make appeals against planning decisions but cannot afford to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> may i point out to him <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord aware that there is a serious situation in the nursing profession particularly with regard to pupil and student nurses <e> <s> the facts which have been corroborated by the general medical council are as follows <e> <s> there has been a serious decline in recruiting student and pupil nurses <e> <s> if this decline continues it must mean that there will inevitably be a shortage of nurses in the not too distant future <e> <s> as has been pointed out by mr albert spanswick of the confederation of health service employees with their vast experience they believe that they can make a contribution towards resolving this problem and therefore may wish to put their services at the disposal of the minister in order to try to improve the current situation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his encouraging reply for which i am most grateful will be warmly received by the nursing profession and that perhaps the few minutes we have just spent on considering this subject may have made a great contribution to the future of great britains national health service and to the nursing profession in particular <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord perhaps convey to his colleagues in the government who might be responsible that they should get back some of the million from the tax cheaters in the city and other places <e> <s> this is miniscule in comparison to that which has been fiddled off the british public by tax evasion <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble lord the foreign and commonwealth secretary referring to the economic aspects of the summit that there are millions of ordinary people who really cannot quite understand why when the leaders of the free world get together they all wish they could beat inflation they all wish they could reduce unemployment but they seem to be able to do very little about resolving those problems <e> <s> then when they are going to talk about defence and the threats that may or may not exist with regard to the soviet <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that the technicalities of the law should always be viewed in the light of humanitarian principles and that where people may have to go back because they are turkish or greek cypriots there ought to be a thorough examination of the circumstances before the ultimate decision is arrived at and they are sent back to a land which although it is their home they are frightened to go back to <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord leaves this point would he allow me to say something <e>", "<cs> my lords surely <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby would not wish to go on the record as being incorrect for is the noble lord not aware that these things have been done <e> <s> civil service leaders have seen members of parliament as well as members of your lordships house <e> <s> the main thing which irritates these leaders is that they have been denied an independent judgment by an outside body by arbitration to decide the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords lord houghton of sowerby was the one who first introduced the subject of consultation into his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord lord spens will forgive me if i do not deal with all the points he made although i wish at the outset to express my sympathy for him in view of the tragic situation that exists among small businesses particularly under the present conservative administration for they are going down the bankruptcy drain faster than at any time in british history <e> <s> that is why i have great sympathy for the noble lord who i hope will listen carefully to what is being said from these benches if he really has the interests of small businessmen at heart i must tell him that i firmly believe that it is only through the policies which are being enunciated by the leader of the opposition that working people and small businessmen can reassert themselves and make their contribution to the welfare of the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that all forms of industrial action hurt those who believe they have been compelled to undertake it and many others as well <e> <s> that is the saddest part of industrial action <e> <s> when however peace comes and the settlement of yesterday we all hope indicates peace should not the concentration of the government be not on making any rash or belligerent statements but on seeking harmony with the civil service unions and returning to the high standard we have enjoyed in this country <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord to look not unkindly at some of the proposals that are being made and to dismiss the statements of those who want to exacerbate the situation despite the settlement that has been agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that most informative reply may i ask him to consider going a little further than chief constables or any aspect of police work since this is a fundamental matter of jurisprudence <e> <s> would he not agree that the first duty of any prosecutor is not to obtain a prosecution but to act as a minister of justice <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is fair to say that people of all political persuasions and of all religious sects throughout this island are gravely concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might make a very small contribution which is very difficult because what i have to say does not strictly apply to the amendment which we are discussing <e> <s> my point very briefly is this and i feel sure that the noble lord lord belstead will understand it <e> <s> when we pass legislation either in this house or in another place and we ourselves read the bills before they become acts we very often do not wholly understand them <e> <s> so everything that we do either in this house or in another place particularly in the case of measures of this character makes for a field day for the lawyers in the first instance <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the changes in recent industrial legislation have meant that many working men and women find it much more difficult than hitherto because of the change of the law by this government to obtain justice at industrial tribunals <e> <s> for example in some instances they have to wait a year whereas hitherto they had to wait six months <e> <s> the number of these cases runs into hundreds whereas the case referred to the european court of human rights involved two people <e> <s> my last point is this <e> <s> i am sure that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor would agree that they made it specific in their report that in no way were they judging the rights or wrongs of the closed shop <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness to bear in mind that since the creation of the first parliamentary commissioner when the rule that only members of another place could make submissions to him and no one else was written in two additional parliamentary commissioners have been appointed one for the national health service and one for local government <e> <s> regarding the parliamentary commissioner for local government an ordinary member of the public can write and complain or ask for help direct <e> <s> does it not seem that there is now a reasonable case to support the submission made by the noble lord lord winstanley <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house would like to acknowledge the remarkable contribution perhaps the most significant contribution of all western statesmen that has been carried out by the british foreign secretary the noble lord lord carrington <e> <s> i think his remarkable endeavours ought to be put on record <e> <s> but if we have just acknowledged that the plo and israel have come to an agreement there could never have been an agreement unless the plo had existed and if we look at our own history all sorts of organisations that were part of the british empire helped to contribute and make the british commonwealth of nations right up to the creation of zimbabwe itself <e> <s> therefore would the noble lord not agree that perhaps a contribution could be made if we were to acknowledge the existence of and recognise the plo <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the chancellor was probably quite correct when he said last july that we are getting to the end of the recession <e> <s> but that is not the real problem <e> <s> the real problem for the benefit of this nation is how quickly we shall get rid of this government and their appalling policies <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that the events that took place in the summer not a mile from this house were very distressing and as a consequence the comments of the noble lord lord renton are very important <e> <s> the figure that the noble lord gave of per cent <e> <s> i believe must be challenged <e> <s> it may be an official figure but it is certainly not a truthful figure <e> <s> what is happening in this particular industry is a grave form of exploitation <e> <s> the trade unions are trying to erase it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i therefore ask would he not consider giving a directive to the wages inspectorate on the points raised by the noble lord lord orr-ewing and the submission i make about some of the existing cheating and irresponsibility which is a shame because there are very many good employers in the catering industry who have to endure the bad name of those who exploit and behave in a mischievous way <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we must take on board the parlous state of our nation as regards industrial disputes in this year of grace in order to understand what we are discussing here tonight in your lordships house <e> <s> can your lordships imagine for one moment any of the heads of the families among the million unemployed not wondering what sort of idiots we are discussing an issue like this when they are wondering whether or not they can pay their rates and their rent and buy the food and the clothes for their children out of their unemployment benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his very informative reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that the grave concern felt by people all over the country is now reaching the point of consternation <e> <s> may i further ask him whether he would be prepared at some time to make a statement that rather than lose lands end to any overseas interest the government will be prepared to help the national trust and the countryside commission financially so that in the national interest lands end can be saved <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am grateful to the noble earl for his informative reply i find it a little disturbing that her majestys government do not know precisely what is at stake <e> <s> the noble earl has just admitted it <e> <s> would it be possible for the noble earl to obtain a few back copies of the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that the probability is that the palestine liberation organisation look upon themselves as something similar say to the free french or the free dutch in this country in the last war and that inevitably they will get some form of financial support <e> <s> and is it not equally distressing that on the other side there are rumours in the british press at <e> <s> least that the occupants of the settlements that the palestinians say are their lands are also being helped financially <e> <s> would it not be right for this house to acknowledge that the british foreign secretary in meeting the plo and anyone else involved is only trying to take out the bitterness and the hatred so that young children and perhaps even those as yet unborn will not grow up to hate and fight one another <e> <s> is not the foreign secretary in following winston churchills dictum that jaw jaw is better than war war contributing to a civilised solution <e>", "<cs> my lords following the very important point made by the noble lord lord orr-ewing with regard to apprenticeships will the noble viscount be prepared to consider in all seats of learning going the whole way to provide for the upper echelons of excellence in british industry <e> <s> this objective could be very well enhanced if there were closer co-operation with the british trade union movement which knows a very great deal about all these things <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as this is a matter where a minister of the crown has been almost savaged by a court of this land may i ask whether the noble earl thinks it appropriate to make it his business to inform the home secretary who has a passionate and sincere interest in law and order that even a colleague who attempts to break the law or to bring the law into disrepute is as bad as anybody else whom the home secretary condemns <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that if there should be some degree of agreement it might be the commencement of the abandonment of the suicidal policies now being followed by the powerful nations on earth <e> <s> therefore would it not be a possibility for her majestys government to consider encouraging both the united states of america and the soviet union to have this item on their agenda in november notwithstanding that the immediate proposals would be objectionable to the usa <e> <s> but perhaps from these with bargaining and discussion progress might be made along the road to sanity <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of these well-meaning schemes to help assist and encourage the disabled to earn a living and to make their contribution have never fully fructified because of some employers dodging the issue <e> <s> one of the things that we ought to consider is a method of enforcement of the law of this land and punishment for those who so dishonourably and disgracefully evade their responsibilities to the disabled folk of our nation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that i agree entirely with what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has said and with what my noble friend has said <e> <s> what must be taken into consideration is that no one can in any way detract from my admiration for the people of gibraltar <e> <s> when in another place i was with others now in your lordships house constant in my vigilance on behalf of gibraltarians as on this particular issue <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that i do not believe that at this stage we can ignore the fact that later on in examining some of these amendments precisely the same argument of honour and contribution to great britain can be advanced in the case of many other millions of people who could be affected unless we change the bill substantially <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord please tell the house what was the basis or the origins of the authority that allowed or permitted the police to act in the way they did <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has misunderstood what i meant <e> <s> under what authority did they act <e> <s> for example were there magistrates warrants issued which permitted the police to break in or on what other authority did they act in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not follow the noble baroness lady platt in everything she said except on one aspect of accountability which most of her speech was about <e> <s> i want to touch on the accountability of the conservative party for what they told this nation during the general election they would do and on how they basely and in an almost corrupt manner did not carry out one single promise that they made to the nation <e> <s> i would say to the noble baroness when she starts talking about accountability that she should have a look at the manifesto of the conservative party and ask those who are now in power why are you disgracing us when we try to hold you accountable for the things you said you would do and which you have failed miserably to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord because he has made a very important point in mentioning the salt agreements i think that that is vital <e> <s> i also believe that what he has said about the soviets reconsidering is absolutely correct <e> <s> but is it not a possibility that if the americans should also show some initiative to recommence the vitally important salt talks as has the noble lord that too could make a contribution to returning to sanity in this troubled world <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend allow me just on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there are many people some might be unilateralists and others would support the arguments submitted by the government who are asking one question namely if there should be any agreement either for a nuclear-free zone or a reduction in nuclear armaments how would it be proved and tested and monitored that such agreements were honoured by both the russians and the west <e> <s> ought not the government to concentrate on this and perhaps make some statement in the not too distant future to explain to people what could happen if we should get back to the road of sanity and start curtailing nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that when things like this appear in newspapers there should be a full explanation of what has really happened so that people should not be left to think harmful things because of innuendoes or improper or incomplete press reports <e> <s> i ask the noble lord to consider that there should be full government statements when something like this appears in the press about ministers and such statements are denied <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that what people are thinking perhaps incorrectly is that there is a possibility of ministers getting in so to speak on the ground floor when they have an advantage and being able to make money by getting people who would normally have the national health service to take up private medicine <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the very important points raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is there not another aspect of british airways reports and accounts namely that because of their financial losses which might be exacerbated in view of the point raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter all the staff will have their pensions reduced as it is now proposed that there should be a reduction on the employers side of the contribution <e> <s> will the noble lord please look at that as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to commence by congratulating the noble lord lord gregson on the able way in which he produced this report <e> <s> i should also like to pay my compliments to the noble viscount lord dilhorne on his maiden speech which i thought was both informative and extremely interesting to listen to and what i always welcome was spiced with humour <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords although i appreciate the need for the fantasy in the noble lords very brave reply does he not really appreciate that among other things it is this report that is causing many people of all political opinions on both sides of industry and commerce to think that it is time that the government acknowledged that there should be a relaxation of their tough attitude <e> <s> the people of all political shades who are protesting do not wish to see the british economy through strict adherence sacrificed on the altar of a disastrous and unjust political dogma <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he is quite correct when he says that britain is halfway on that table of but the fact still remains that although that is our position the rich are taxed least at the expense of the poor and because of adherence to this policy of monetarism <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord and his colleagues behind him will not find anything humorous in million colleagues who are on the dole <e> <s> my question is this will he please be good enough to look very hard at the report and ensure that people are requested that the policies involved are at least looked at <e> <s> that is not an unreasonable request <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor aware that there is some concern by the public about the lack of proper machinery for complaints <e> <s> may i also say that i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for his very considerate reply <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many of the ordinary people who work for the glc are also ratepayers <e> <s> would not the government be showing a much more responsible attitude if they were investigating the billion that is being fiddled in tax evasion as revealed in an examination <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that that figure is absolutely astounding yet in your lordships house

ambulances the situation has changed <e> <s> expertise has been increased among all three arms and ought there not now to be consideration in view of the changes i have adumbrated over the past few years of more co-ordination among the three arms of this very vital service <e> <s> this would show that we care for the magnificent work that the noble lord has said that they are doing <e> <s> i

current economists have done to get us into this dreadful situation <e> <s> is it not at least in the interests of the nation to try it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in his reply to the original question he quite rightly concentrated on the improvement in the private sector <e> <s> what concerns many of us is that it has been at a massive detriment to the public sector <e> <s> the figures are as follows <e> <s> last year the amount of council <e>", "<cs> my lords i was just about to ask my question when i was interrupted <e> <s> i was asking whether the noble lord was aware

lord aware that much of the increase in the number of nurses that he has mentioned goes back to three years ago <e> <s> last year those nurses finished their three years training and became fully qualified nurses <e> <s> is there not a danger that that has now dropped off and that we shall not be in that happy situation because of the current lack of attraction to the service <e> <s> will the noble lord please again bear in mind the point which has already been made that because these young men and women do not threaten any militant action or anything of that character it would be extremely wrong if they were in any way victimised because of their faithfulness and loyalty to their great profession <e>", "<cs> my lords beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> but when the noble lord quotes that figure my lords does it take cognisance of the rate of inflation <e> <s> although the increase might sound grand in this place in

viscount agree that perhaps a lowering of the bank rate and other interest rates would enhance the confidence of the small businessman who i believe has a magnificent contribution to make and that if this is announced early it would make some contribution to easing the fear of the nation when today the highest figure for unemployment ever recorded has been announced <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that bnoc not only has a future in regard to the british economy but perhaps even more vitally particularly in these dangerous days in which we live it has a role and can have an increasing role <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that in so far as the cap covers per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> of the eec budget this is vital and that incidents of the kind

vital respect if the cuts in education proceed right through the comprehensive schools technical colleges and our universities and that the effect of this can be very serious and have a deleterious effect on industrial research and indeed cast a shadow over our industrial future <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the truth behind the statistics is as follows under the governments of mr heath mr wilson and mr callaghan the standard of life of the british people crept up slowly but never in any way diminished <e> <s> it only started to drop when this government took over <e>", "<cs> my lords if one wanted to take a brutal partisan line with regard to this bill one would encourage the government to proceed with similar bills in the future because this is a bill

british working man and woman to defend his or her standard of living <e> <s> if that is not pressed they will need to have to take some form of action to make good what the government are taking off them <e> <s> therefore the spiral will be given an unnecessary and vicious twist <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that student protests and student rags are part of the democratic structure of this country <e> <s> would it not be much nicer to read the student protestations as student rags and not create a situation like that in poland <e> <s> is it not dangerous to applaud what solidarity is doing and then to kick our own students in the teeth for exercising the freedom to which they are entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that people who are experiencing and suffering poverty in this country will in no way be able to take great comfort from his answer that there are many others in europe suffering poverty as well <e> <s> does he not agree that this report reflects the absurdity of the situation in our own island that we are paying millions and millions to keep able-bodied men and women young and middle-aged out of work <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that reply may i ask him whether he appreciates that many of these state registered nurses and state enrolled nurses who comprise that figure started their training some two or three years ago and that what has happened in subsequent years is that it is dropping off <e> <s> may i also ask him this in so far as there has been some concern in the nursing profession about remuneration will he allow the national council to try to put things right and

of local authorities <e> <s> indeed they work as a team <e> <s> what is really happening is that because the local authorities are being in my view unjustly hurt by and have to endure cuts in a very sensitive area their staffs are reduced and there are not enough to liaise with the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am conscious of the distinguished noble lords who have spoken and will speak in this debate men who have made a massive contribution both to the national health service and the whole field of medicine <e> <s> i pay tribute to my noble friend lord wells-pestell and unlike the noble lord lord perry of walton i believe he has brought to the attention of the house tonight a matter of vital importance to many people who are not doctors consultants or registrars <e> <s> ordinary people know what terrible anguish and grief can be exacerbated if it is thought that the loss of a loved-one has occurred because someone has been over-tired over-worked or has not been in tip-top form <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the efforts being made by her majestys government in trying to get a rational approach to britains contribution to the eec are applauded everywhere <e> <s> because of the tremendous importance of this issue and of the fact that it would appear that britain is being ganged up against and our government are standing almost alone in

take the vile discrimination which is operating against this nation <e>", "<cs> my lords while broadly in agreement with what the noble lord has said may i ask whether the noble lord would agree that should changes of this kind be contemplated the legal status of the staff involved would also have to be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask whether he will make sure that notwithstanding the activities of the soviet government in trying to drown out the truth we will continue our support for the independent trade union solidarity which speaks for the people of poland <e> <s> may i further ask him to convey to his right honourable friend the foreign secretary that despite attacks by the right-wing press of this country and the vulgar and abominable expressions used by the united states secretary of state his cold courage and persistent endeavour

of all sensible people throughout the world <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that we should make it clear to all those who are oppressing the people of poland that in our country millions of ordinary people over the past years owe the raising of their standard of living to the british trade union movement and that that must be the permitted endeavour of the polish rulers whomsoever they may be towards their trade unions <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that it is not beyond the bounds of peradventure that the advice given by the london boroughs association to its constituent members could be as illegal as the advice that the glc received from its legal advisers <e> <s> what is really required is a clearing up of the law so that this kind of awful situation in which local government finds itself cannot occur again <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that houses had been sold most of them to sitting tenants <e> <s> with whose permission were they sold to people other than sitting tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there are many people who will regret that he has demoted the parable of the good samaritan in favour of some of the ethics of the merchant of venice and that squeezing this couple of ounces of flesh million will not do credit either to the government or to the nation <e> <s> on the question of reciprocity would the noble lord be good enough to examine the situation where people who come to our nation somehow or other and many try to learn and understand our ways to take them back to their own countries will not be able to have any reciprocity in their countries <e> <s> also on the question of reciprocity i think that the wider we can spread the principle on which the national health service is based throughout the world rather than devoting millions to nuclear weapons the quicker sanity will return <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply may i ask him whether he is aware that the threats to the state of israel which at one time seemed real have never really materialised but that on the contrary thousands of ordinary people have paid with their lives for aggression by the state of israel which many of the inhabitants of that country deeply regret and that within that nation there are people who believe that the activities of its present government in the annexation of the golan heights make no contribution to peace in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that prior to the national health service the whole question of private medical research was hampered tremendously because of the lack of organisation and the lack of funds <e> <s> in short it was hit or miss <e> <s> is he also aware that in the case of the westminster hospital the really dedicated men and women there feel terribly unhappy that their lease of life might be months at the outside <e> <s> is this not merely an absurdity but also a disgraceful threat to the dedicated men and women working in research in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to add just a few <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware i am sure that he is because of his experience and background that the service provided by british local government is truly remarkable much of it rarely realised <e> <s> the work of local authorities and local councils is often the butt of newspapers and so on <e> <s> does the noble lord not agree that the present government seem to be obsessed with two words making somebody redundant giving him the sack and putting him on the dole <e> <s> does he not also agree that local authorities give a great deal of encouragement contracts and support to private industries and that this provides a way for both sides of industry public and private to work together in harmony <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the

ways and also from those who have a different philosophy <e> <s> but running through the entire debate was a degree of unhappiness about what has been happening to our national health service in the past two years <e> <s> that might account for the belligerent attitude of the noble lord the minister in his contribution earlier <e> <s> i think he must have sensed it and i am very happy that he made his contribution in the way that he did because he recognised a great deal and felt a little upset about it <e> <s> i hope that when he makes his contribution at the end of the debate he will

asking themselves regarding this debate <e> <s> as we have heard from time to time the soviet union has an enormous advantage in nuclear and non-nuclear weapons <e> <s> why then should they wait for us to catch up with them in three or four years time before they launch any attack <e> <s> secondly would not the noble viscount agree that when any proposition is made which might lead to a cessation

aware that the point of raising this question in the beginning was the grave apprehension experienced by those who represent british nurses <e> <s> because as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter quite rightly said the british nurse male or female is held in high regard throughout the world therefore that must mean that their standard of training whether for sen state registered nurse or state

is going on by people from foreign nations <e> <s> would he not at least be prepared to consider perhaps talking to the representatives of our nurses the royal college of nursing and the confederation

redolent of industrial conscription <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that in our previous discussions on the teenager training scheme it was pointed out that if a teenager did not accept

evidence to show that it is passed on to the general body of consumers <e> <s> should this not occupy the mind of the government to see that fair play goes right the way through <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me the banality of that argument is distressing <e> <s> is he really saying that for a week the british workforce would rather go out and catch a cold catch a disease or have an accident in order to be at home and not to go to work <e> <s> the argument is that when you are home sick when you are ill when you have had an illness or when you have had an accident in the pit the factory or the steelworks by the time you have paid your prescription charge and many other things the cost mounts up considerably <e> <s> therefore what the noble lord is inadvertently submitting is that the overwhelming majority of british workers are scroungers and that is not the case <e> <s> nobody wants to be sick nobody wants to be ill at any time the average british worker would rather be earning his living because he has a dignity than having anything free under the excuse that he is ill <e> <s> if it is an excuse that he is ill his doctor has joined in that cheating by certifying that he is ill and sick <e>", "<cs> that is the real world <e>", "<cs> the minister has just said that there are a few <e> <s> will he allow this brave noble lord to tell him that one of the fundamental principles of all british legislation is not to legislate for a tiny minority but to legislate for the broad majority <e>", "<cs> i would ask the noble minister if he would reconsider the

lord a further question <e> <s> the noble lord should be thanked for having read the terms of the conference and what went on there but may i ask whether he will be sending an acknowledgement saying that he appreciates all that was conveyed during that conference and the apprehensions of the people involved <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the occupation of these british islands was very carefully planned by the argentine dictators and that what has proceeded from there is very much their responsibility <e> <s> therefore would not her majestys government accept that any future interim arrangements for discussions must not endanger in any way the lives of british servicemen which then in turn could endanger the lives of argentinian servicemen as well and make the

argentine to represent to her majestys government any difficulties that they might incur and who is looking after their interests on our behalf <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that in so far as the argentine military junta have no parliament to answer to if things get difficult they might indulge in a recklessness which could compel us to take equal action not in a reckless way but

television crews on the hermes sending back news inviting united nations military and technical observers to join our task force and report to the world what is going on <e>", "<cs> on that point of supply what is distressing many people is that the price which is being offered in privatisation is roughly years supply at a rate of two years in other words the government intend to sell off over two years the total amount of oil that it would take bnoc and the gas side of it years to produce <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree and this is a vital important question to government and parliament alike that we all know what goes on in the soviet union in poland and in south africa <e> <s> in the governments view is south africa regarded as a free country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that there is another dimension that we must always keep in front of us namely that the argentine aggressors now occupying the falkland islands have a political and social way of behaving which is as totally alien to the falkland islanders as it is to these british islands <e> <s> is he also aware that the grave dilemma that we face is how to see to it that freedom and right as we understand them are established without the massive use of force and the horrid loss of life <e> <s> would it therefore not be possible for her majestys government to consider asking the united nations that if the argentinians withdraw and go back to their country we will not occupy but that a united nations force and administrators should occupy the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my

circumstances in the s under conservative governments there was and there had to be a release of rates up to per cent <e> <s> for industrial ratepayers <e> <s> in other parts of the country there were queues of domestic ratepayers miles long as in merthyr tydfil where it took people eight or nine hours queueing outside the county court to answer summonses for not paying their rates <e> <s> that is a situation which i do not want to see arise in this country again and that is why i made the points that i made in response to the very able and sensible way in which the amendment was moved by the noble lord lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> would he not agree that if we can make this first step a reality it will create a new climate in the long search for peace and security <e> <s> the other attribute is that it will stop the maiming and killing and the suffering of humanity in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that what he has said this afternoon will make a massive contribution to those who read his words on both sides of this grievious dispute <e> <s> one day they will have to meet and they will have to talk because the alternative is that they will have to go on killing <e> <s> i would have thought that any sane person in this chamber would agree that this cannot be <e> <s> therefore i suggest that her majestys government use their good offices to bring the issue to the united nations

to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that reply is he aware that the modified recommendations of the tsrb have made a total mockery and revealed the injustice of this governments policies in that top judges and admirals have an increase of around per cent <e> <s> while those who care and serve in the health service when the people of this country are sick and ill have been treated in a scandalous manner <e> <s> before indignation escalates too high would the noble lord be prepared to see his right honourable friend and to meet the leaders of the health service in view of the anger felt at the acceptance of the modified tsrb recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that millions of our fellow citizens in great britain now suffer under the interventionist policy of this government which is just as interventionist as the policy in the soviet union <e> <s> there is no free negotiation they are held down <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord aware that there is no free negotiation and that they are dictated to by the government <e> <s> is he further aware that if he were to refer to his right honourable friend the feeling of employees within the national health service he might then be prepared to see the leaders <e> <s> finally is the noble lord aware that some aspects of management are acting with what is almost a polish junta attitude to some of those who are demonstrating which could be serious <e>", "<cs> and would he put that to his right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that i agree with him absolutely on his comments regarding the task force <e> <s> what i find difficult is that if there is a possibility as the noble and learned lord said of the officials who have this responsibility to examine statements would he advise that perhaps the next question on the order paper ought not to be asked <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that if he agrees as we all agree with the first point made by the noble lord lord beloff then he should at least be prepared to examine the second point made by the noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> those of us who have been involved with the british commonwealth both in this place and for many a decade in the other place know full well that the faceless moguls in the treasury play an important part <e> <s> much of what the noble lord lord beloff has said i can substantiate with evidence running over at least a decade and a half which could be provided to the noble lord <e> <s> it is about time i believe that we gave our full support to the proposition in honour of the way in which the british commonwealth has stood by us in times of stress <e>", "<cs> my lords what the minister has just said seems quite reasonable but it has about it a touch of hit or miss which seems to be part and parcel of the governments legislation <e> <s> would it not be better for safetys sake to accept the amendment <e> <s> there would be no great loss of face if it were accepted <e> <s> people want to know what exactly registration means <e> <s> what is

friends lord ross lord wilson of langside lord beswick and then the minister <e> <s> listening to the submissions that were made it appeared to me that what the noble lord the minister was saying was that he more or less could say to the committee that what the amendment desires is accommodated later in the bill <e> <s> he just nodded his head <e> <s> the logic that is left and there is no escape for him is to accept the amendment if he agrees that it is covered later in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as a previous report submitted that the increase in health service expenditure would have to be about per cent <e> <s> in order to enable the service to stand still to meet the cost of inflation and other impositions they are suffering from does the noble lord not agree that although this is not a bad performance on the part of the government we are not moving forward as rapidly as we should <e> <s> would it not be a much better idea if the government instead of waiting for the employees of the health service to get exasperated were to meet them and see if they could meet some of their demands in a more rational way rather than let the situation continue as it has been doing <e>",

with regard to the point on industrial action i believe <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that on information i have previously received i have in this house asked the government to meet the leaders of the trade unions involved in order to avoid the industrial action that is now taking place <e> <s> it is still not too late for the government to make a move <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while he is quite right when he says that there are certain old hospitals that have been closed and it may be that that was necessary what causes frustration is that a brand spanking new hospital of which i am sure he is aware of will be when i have finished was not allowed to be opened to the full but only half of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i will immediately respond to the noble baroness the leader of the house and put the question quite fairly <e> <s> i thought i put it quite fairly anyway <e> <s> as the noble lord said certain old hospitals have been closed and maybe

statement made by his right honourable friend in another place is to be welcomed and that lots of people will be asking how long it will be before this kind of thing is done again <e> <s> many folk will also be terribly worried if the government do not act and at least take this opportunity of telling the house quite clearly that they are certainly not going to adopt the genuflecting posture of the liberal front bench in this house but will take this issue in a very serious way and tell the community that they have done this once but they will not get away with it again unless there is proper consultation about the rules because that is the only way in which they will be indulged <e>", "<cs> my lords i seek your lordships indulgence in so far as my name is not on the list of speakers <e> <s> however i have read the report and it seems to me having been born in the valleys of south wales where we depended wholly upon providing the nation with coal coke steel and shipping

lord lord kearton this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the point made in the supplementary question asked by the noble lord lord orr-ewing regarding the improvement and increase in technology in the auxiliary staff work of the health service is a very real and important issue <e> <s> would he not also agree that the use of modern technology in the health service might be improved particularly as regards preventive medicine <e> <s> what we really want to see is a decrease in the productivity of doctors nurses and specialists and not an increase which means

creeping up and that perhaps the criteria he referred to ought to be re-examined by all sectors of british steel and the government and in particular the iron and steel confederation of british industry which is the trade union side so that a united endeavour can be made to see that british steel is not finished off <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that in so far as this whole business did not start with military action it will end with military action and that it is vital that regardless of how few in number the falkland islanders are they are not to be sacrificed to a fascist military junta and that is the basis of the authority of our action <e> <s> after that is it not also sensible that at some time perhaps when the battle is ending the government will start thinking of the connections which end the battle and the commencement of a new era for peace in all of that area <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment because really to understand the amendment one has to read a little further on the following page <e> <s> it seems that it is to be compulsory for the commission to examine the economy efficiency and effectiveness in the provision of local authority services <e> <s> that seems to be a mammoth task <e> <s> what i think would be much more sensible is that if the commission were apprehensive about something they would examine perhaps the whole structure of local authority and then submit a report <e> <s> but to say that they shall report on every little item dot every i and cross every t might mean that if they do that there is a possibility of missing something fundamental that they ought to report on <e> <s> i think that if the government would look at it in that way from the point of view of efficiency and from a point of sensibility from the standpoint of the commission the commission would be able to concentrate on what they think is important <e> <s> i believe that the government should prefer may to shall and i would support the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord spoke about local authorities giving value for money <e> <s> in my experience and i am sure in the experience of the noble lord too very often

is absolutely unfair for the police for the armed services and for example the firemen to have a certain high level while when the nurses want to negotiate on that basis the government forbid it <e>

that the workload has increased in hospitals for people who are there for a specific time and for those who have to appear just once a day <e> <s> this must therefore say conclusively that if the workload has increased the nurses are perfectly justified in seeking the increase of their salaries they are asking for <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord care to reconsider his first answer to me which would suggest that if the government and various national health service administrators are trying to enlist young men and women to enter this noble profession <e> <s> and they succeed and that means there is no increase in the workload they do not stand much chance of keeping pace in their remuneration with the rest of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the governments real intention will the noble lord the minister then tell the house what has been done <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree at least that there is something of which we must be cognisant that after what happened to our kinsmen in the falkland islands we had the strength the nerve and the determination to carry out the action required <e> <s> therefore would he not agree that where such things happen in any part of the world particularly with the way in which south africa is behaving we should not take any profit <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that there is a terrible paradox here <e> <s> when we are talking about the defence of freedom and strategic manoeuvres does not the minister agree that we ought not to indulge in treating other human beings as mere chattels <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that we have to face the fact that it is not so much the afghan government it is the invading terrorist force that is there <e> <s> that is what we have to acknowledge <e> <s> the greatest irritant to them it may not be the case with dr pinder-wilson and what they are frightened of is the dissident voice <e> <s> would the noble lord not give an assurance that we in this country through our government will always make sure that the dissident voice wherever it may be raised will get our approval and support to be dissident <e>", "<cs>

<e>", "<cs> is the noble minister aware that what <e>", "<cs> when the noble earl is addressing himself to the noble lord i wonder whether he will apply the same argument to the trade unionists who have made their submission for a wage increase on the same basis that inflation is eating away their standards of life <e>", "<cs> i cannot allow the noble earl to get away with that <e> <s> if he does not reply to what i said he cannot reply to what the noble lord said <e> <s> accuracy on a vital issue like this cannot be smothered away in a few seconds with a tiny bit of humour because there are million people outside this chamber who will be watching desperately what will happen if their standards of life are depressed and if their rights to increase them in order to enable them to buy things from manufacturers and many organisations which are represented by noble lords opposite are lost <e> <s> that is all they want to do with their wage increases and i fear that they will not be prepared to have a vital aspect of their point of view dismissed by a cursory joke <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be prepared in view of lord boyd-carpenters question he never answered this point directly to consider asking the foreign secretary to make further representations on the points that have been made in this chamber this afternoon and include in them the fact that there exist extraordinarily good relations between the gibraltarians and the contiguous towns on the other side of the border from both commercial and general good conditions <e> <s> it is these things which are also at stake as well as thwarting the possibility of spain joining the eec <e> <s> all these points ought to be made afresh in view of the debate in this house today <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he can have the best of both worlds <e> <s> local authorities can make a massive contribution by providing old peoples homes in their areas <e> <s> at the moment these homes are constructed and older folk move in they seem to attract the attention of a proportion of our youth who indulge in a great deal of voluntary help to aid the old people <e> <s> will the noble lord also take into consideration relieving local authorities from any cuts that prevent them from building old peoples homes which then prevents local authorities attracting voluntary services to assist them <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble minister not agree that we in this country have a specific interest in matters of these kinds that refer to south africa <e> <s> we are the mother country of a great multiracial commonwealth which could not stomach the views of south africa and she was ejected out of that commonwealth <e> <s> if we do not stand fast by its great principles all that we shall be doing is giving succour to opponents of ours from communist regimes who cash in on anything like this <e> <s> would the noble lord make a statement beyond any peradventure that great britain as the head of a great multiracial commonwealth will do her utmost to see that in no way does she collaborate with the appalling racialist regime of south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to give full support to trade union leaders like mr albert spanswick of cohse who has gone out of his way to condemn absolutely this sort of behaviour by members of his and other unions <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that what the government should be doing is not trying to fight those who are completely raping the agreements of their own union but are giving them support in this way by indicating that all the trade unions involved are behaving in an irresponsible manner when the fact is that they themselves have condemned wholeheartedly this form of repugnant behaviour <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i want if i may to approve and applaud the endeavours of the british government over the past few weeks because they seem to be realistically appraised of the slaughter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that encouraging reply which will give some hope to many in that part of the world where the carnage is now terrible and which i feel will be condemned by nearly every civilised human being <e> <s> i am proud to hear that our government are playing their part in endeavouring to get relief quickly to the lebanese people <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i fully take his point and accept immediately that the aid being provided will not be limited merely to the lebanese people although they no doubt are the greatest sufferers but that it is for other people who are suffering as well <e> <s> would he be prepared to give me an assurance that if there is any interference by the aggressors and invaders in the area with humanitarian aid being taken to people who are suffering so drastically this government will give a world lead in condemning such action <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that british manufacturers can make some efforts to overcome inclement weather <e> <s> their great difficulty and their almost impossible task is to overcome the policy of the present government where we have seen a rise in unemployment to million people and the highest rate of bankruptcies that this country has seen since the war <e> <s> does the noble viscount not think that he is exhibiting only a degree of petulance while we on this side are just as much concerned about those who have lost their jobs as we are about those who under this government have lost their businesses as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord elton is no doubt aware that the nation is appalled at what has happened but may i point out to him that there is another dimension <e> <s> security already being tightened no doubt at buckingham palace but there are other residences which her majesty the queen has to visit from time to time <e> <s> will the minister say quite categorically that they too sandringham and other <e>", "<cs> i wanted to follow the extremely important statement the noble lord lord harris of greenwich made when he said that it behoves every trade unionist to obey the law of this country <e> <s> i think it behoves every briton to obey and support the law of this country <e> <s> what i find despicable and disdainful is when people like lord harris pick just on one sector <e> <s> that is the failure of this debate both in the other place and here <e> <s> we take a number of our british citizens and in one aspect they are trade unionists <e> <s> i hope lord harris with his tiny knowledge of trade unions will listen because his knowledge will be increased by what i have to say <e> <s> they are not only trade unionists <e>", "<cs> there is an exhibition of courage the committee will note <e> <s> let me go on to say further that what the government ought to be aware of is this that people who are coalminers who are steelworkers working in shops who serve behind counters people who drive lorries people who make a massive contribution to the wealth of our nation i do not think anyone would deny that the point was made very ably earlier in the debate in addition belong to their voluntary organisations to their churches and chapels and synagogues they belong to all the voluntary endeavour and sporting endeavour of this nation <e> <s> therefore to put them in a tight little category because they are trade unionists i find entirely despicable which is about the correct description of the speech we have heard from lord harris <e> <s> i do not know which way he voted in on this particular issue perhaps he will tell us <e> <s> he used to be a minister and he would not have been one of her majestys ministers <e>", "<cs> what amendment are we on <e>", "<cs> i accept the noble earls apology to me but i am not prepared to accept his advice as to how to proceed <e> <s> he should have been listening and he should listen very carefully in the future <e> <s> what i was going on to say was that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in my judgment made a very strone point in his speech <e> <s> if it is wrong for me to comment on what lord boyd-carpenter said a moment ago it must be wrong for him to say what i am now going to comment on <e> <s> i think that is very sensible and with half an hours thought i think it will sink into the noble ministers mind <e> <s> what lord boyd-carpenter says often attracts me <e> <s> he was not making a speech which was pathologically anti-trade union <e> <s> indeed both he and the noble lord lord campbell said that at times they would like to see a strong british trade union movement <e> <s> i find it most encouraging to hear that remark from the benches opposite <e>", "<cs> all that i can reply to that is that statements were made <e> <s> i admit that the noble lord lord has a very strong point <e> <s> in the other place on <e>", "<cs> i will indeed let the noble lord speak but let me finish this first <e> <s> the argument went like this <e> <s> the social contract limited and placed a degree of inhibition on the free trade union movement of this country <e> <s> it is perfectly true that it had nothing to do with parliament but it was just as much an agreement between the political wing of the labour party and its industrial wing as are many aspects of the conservative party and the conservative government with the cbi and the many people allied to them <e> <s> the social contract helped our nation and there was a response from the trade union movement <e> <s> indeed its membership increased and it helped the country to get back on its feet <e> <s> i ask noble lords to consider that when debating these measures <e> <s> i give way to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> it is relevant to clause of the bill because if what was proposed in that motion earlier on had then been put into legislation the clause that we are now debating would have been a massive turn face it would have been absolutely inappropriate to put in the bill <e> <s> the noble lord is tempting me to say that people should beware of the fact that what the conservative party does in opposition to cajole and get people to think how liberally minded they are they do not mean to follow when they get into government <e>", "<cs> lf as the noble lord says the employer shielded from the complaint that he was actually dismissed because of trade union pressure what then was the excuse of untruth that the employer used to dismiss the employee <e> <s> if the real reason was concealed initially but nevertheless the worker had the sack what has happened in between as to why he was dismissed if the real reason is not given until later on <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect may i say that the hearing is taking place because the employee was dismissed <e> <s> that is how i understand it and how the noble lord understands it <e> <s> the employee was dismissed apparently for some fictitious reason and later on because he was dismissed the appeal goes to the tribunal and at some stage lo and behold <e> <s> the truth emerges it was because of trade union pressure <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord campbell of alloway in his plea to the minister and at the same time i support the plea made by my noble friend lord wedderburn of charlton <e> <s> we all agree that the massive amount of litigation that now exists in our lives is getting frightening <e> <s> when one considers as the noble lord lord campbell of alloway has said that we are making i think he used these words beanfeasts for lawyers well there are some beans and some feasts <e>", "<cs> i should like to emphasise one point which occured to me when the noble earl was speaking <e> <s> one tried to follow the arguments as closely as possible <e> <s> the point that i am trying to make is that the noble earl referred to the fact that no one need worry if they keep within the law <e> <s> does he mean the law that might come if this bill becomes an act or the law at the moment extant <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a comment which i think is rather vital and important <e> <s> i am not prepared to comment on what the noble lord lord george-brown has just said because i do not think it is worth it <e> <s> i do not believe for example that british trade unionists today are ruled by a bunch of cliques <e> <s> they still have the same sense of honour and dignity as they had in the noble lords day and my day when we were both members of the same union although i am bound to say that i think that there is much more democracy in that union now than when the noble lord lord george-brown and i were members of it many years ago <e> <s> i shall also not be tempted to comment on what i thought was the unnecessarily offensive way in which the noble lord referred to my noble friend lord wedderburn on the front bench <e> <s> i think that his comments were quite uncalled for and highly offensive <e> <s> the noble lord was taking advantage and we all know what we call people who take advantage of other people who cannot immediately reply <e>", "<cs> following what has just been said i am bound to say that in my judgment it is probably the most sober contribution on this amendment that we have heard <e> <s> i feel that the referendum was born out of an emotional spasm because of the present railway strike <e> <s> what i should like to be clearly understood is that every noble lord and noble baroness should know in their minds precisely under existing legislation legislation which is congruous and has to be so to the trade union rule books the manner in which ballots are held <e> <s> then there are the responses in different parts of the country <e> <s> i am quite sure that what the noble baroness said talking as an ordinary woman to ordinary people probably in the southern part of our country <e>", "<cs> then in the wealthier parts of our country <e> <s> it was said that there is a great animosity to the strike which is going on at the moment <e> <s> but when one looks at the great industrial areas and i have some experience of this and at the results of ballots and this is what i hope your lordships will understand one sees that sometimes according to some trade union rules ballots have to be taken region by region <e> <s> therefore you can get an aye vote in wales and scotland and a no vote in say the midlands and in the south of england <e> <s> then the numbers have to be collated together and the decision is made <e> <s> there is also the awkward part which i think was adumbrated by the noble lord who has just sat down of how you get them back which really means that unless all our objectives have been achieved they will stay on strike <e> <s> that cannot be so there must be another ballot <e>", "<cs> where does the noble lord get the impression that all british trade unionists are single and do not have wives children aunts uncles and so on <e> <s> would he explain to the committee why he believes that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am most grateful for the assurance that he has just given that the government intend to continue with this principle <e> <s> is he further aware that many people believe that if we could increase our fervour for reciprocity in regard to this great principle which was initiated by this nation then particularly in the times in which we live of slaying and maiming it not only would be of benefit to our nation but could indeed encourage mankind to tread a much saner course than the one it is on at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that if we could brush aside much of the bureacracy that is involved in the principle of reciprocity we would make a big step forward <e> <s> is he aware that i am one of those who happens to believe that if when my fellow countrymen went to another country and people from other countries came here and something happened to them to their families to their children or to their relatives they received the treatment which any human being should be given and there was no question of asking whence they came but to help them overcome either grief or pain when such people returned to their countries and our people come back to our country it would increase the feeling that we are all of one great race and make a contribution to achieving world peace <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that very many people who are desperately interested in this question recognise many of the difficulties that are involved in making disarmament a reality and that one of them seems to be that when conventions conferences and summits are called and they agree to certain decisions on reducing arms the problem seems to be how can the one side or the other be certain that the others are playing the game and are actually carrying out the decisions of the conference and disarming <e> <s> can the government pay a great deal of attention to that aspect and perhaps find a formula where any agreement could be seen to be implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord lord trefgarne aware that the analogy he drew with the situation in is not going to help this current situation in any way whatsoever but only damage it <e>", "<cs> like the top salaries review body <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the people of the london borough of ealing have for many years suffered appallingly from aircraft noise both leaving and arriving at heathrow particularly in the ealing sectors of greenford and northolt <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that although the building of the a flyover has caused considerable concern people have been helped by the department of the environment assisting them to install double glazing <e> <s> could not the minister please inquire whether or not it is possible for those who suffer from aircraft noise to receive similar treatment <e> <s> finally would it be possible for the minister to inquire into whether the stacking of aircraft before they arrive at heathrow could be so organised as to limit so far as is humanly possible the amount of noise <e>", "<cs> double glazing <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise primarily to make a plea to the noble lord lord elton <e> <s> i shall not deal too greatly with the details of the case <e> <s> i can well understand that more than likely the noble lord has received a briefing from the civil servants at the home <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that both this proposal and indeed other proposals submitted by the noble baroness lady burton would do a number of things <e> <s> it could make air travel more safe <e> <s> it would make it more comfortable and easy for people <e> <s> it would make fares much cheaper <e> <s> in short it could greatly improve not merely our european air services but world air services <e> <s> may i therefore ask the noble lord to take very seriously the submissions which the noble baroness has made and ensure that they are communicated to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that when the first statement on this matter was made a few days ago i put forward the view that it would be perhaps not futile but certainly foolish if the security measures to be undertaken were confined simply to buckingham palace because the queen and her family on numerous occasions during the year do repair to other residences <e> <s> can the minister therefore say that we shall not wait until something happens in one or other of the royal residences before there is a security examination there <e> <s> ought not all the other royal residences to be included in this examination as well as buckingham palace <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that if the government had the courage to appoint an arbitrator he would take full cognisance of the governments view because the trade unions believe that part of his remit ought to be to see that this sort of thing does not happen again <e> <s> is the minister aware that as regards this dispute the trades union congress issued a code of conduct accepted by the trade unions involved which says that all fuel oxygen medical and vital supplies must not be interfered with <e> <s> is the minister further aware that if he will supply the confederation of health service employees with details of what has been alleged in this chamber this afternoon they are quite prepared to give of their level best and to make visits by senior secretaries to the region concerned to see that the tucs code of conduct in this dispute is fully adhered to <e> <s> would the noble lord be prepared to let the confederation know the details so that they can stop any abuses of the code of conduct <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> if he is asking a question i can correct him <e> <s> the facts are simply these the number of students who started in are now full-time nurses <e> <s> what is perturbing is that in a few years time because of the lack of student nurses we shall have a shortage and if they have to carry on with this minimum pay we shall be lucky if we have any nurses at all <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the almost jocular way in which he approaches these questions does not give much encouragement to the million unemployed two-thirds of whom were created by this government nor to the hundreds made bankrupt every day and does he not think that a policy which deliberately creates inflation is a form of governmental masochism so that they may get credit for reducing it <e> <s> is this not a serious issue that ought to be treated by any government spokesman in a most serious way <e>", "<cs> my lords does that really mean that if an ordinary trade union member committed some act or made some threat which was nothing to do with his branch region national officers general secretary or president nevertheless they could be held guilty for the behaviour of one single member <e> <s> that act might be done deliberately to get somebody in an embarrassing situation <e> <s> does it mean that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bellwin is quite right in saying that there is some difference of philosophy between us but one can argue that about every subject that comes before this house or before another place <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord seriously to consider that it is not merely a principle of philosophy or if one could accept it a philosophy of the constitution of these parliaments <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that all sane people would wish to see urgently a massive reduction in all sorts of arms strategic and otherwise but that the thought in the mind of everyone is that when governments agree at whatever level on talks about reductions ordinary people ask themselves how do we know that they will honour what they have agreed at conferences <e> <s> is it not now about time that the way in which agreements on the reduction of arms reached at summits or elsewhere are going to be made a reality should be the main subject of discussion in all these debates on the reduction of arms <e> <s> it is will the agreements be honoured and how can they be proved to be honoured <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that another important aspect would be to change the governments economic policy so that neither the gifted nor the non-gifted are penalised when they both join the dole queue <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the horrendous slaughter now going on in the lebanon deliberately planned can only sow the seeds of bitterness and wrath for generations to come among jews and arabs <e> <s> would it not be far better if her majestys government and our great ally the united states of america claimed that the same united nations that created the state of israel should demand that israel and others associated with the united nations now obey the instructions of the security council to stop the carnage <e> <s> in short is it not time that some civilised behaviour took over instead of invasion slaughtering and killing to stop what could be a venomous feeling from one generation to the other if it still continues <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there is an aspect of this entire discussion i am sure he is aware of this which has not yet been touched on but ought to have been <e> <s> during the last war the new zealanders imposed on themselves precisely the same rations that were extant in the united kingdom from to <e> <s> they could have laid massive amounts of dairy produce and food on the table of every new zealand family but they did not <e> <s> they saw that that was sent to the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords have we therefore not a moral responsibility to ensure that new zealanders are given a fair deal in any aspect of great britains involvement <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether or not he agrees that verification has always held up any agreement leading to the abolition of nuclear weapons <e> <s> ought not therefore the government to take a lead in calling a conference on the principles of verification and making known the results of such a conference <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in a difficult position in the almost paradoxical situation of trying to improve what i consider to be a highly distasteful parliamentary proposal that is aimed at so many millions of what might be described as working class people <e> <s> i certainly appreciate that there are not many members of this house who come into that particular category but i am very proud that i do <e> <s> i believe that a proper form of parliament will not let such ridiculous class bias affect its mind <e>", "<cs> in a moment <e> <s> despite all that i have said i do not want parliament our legislative chambers to be made to look foolish even in regard to a bill such as this <e> <s> it might provide a field day for the lawyers and it is quite possible that after the bill is passed

of us who are involved in trade union and employer negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may comment immediately on what the noble lord who has just sat down has said about the role of the trade unions i should like to point out that contrary to government propaganda and the propaganda of the mass media of this country we all know that the overwhelming majority of newspapers are anti-labour anti-trade union and in consequence that much of the rubbish that they print is often believed by people who ought to know better <e> <s> let us take the point of the noble lord who has just sat down

who say that half the nations troubles arise because and i beg your lordships to listen to this working people have been having too high wages <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not equally disgraceful that all the things the noble earl has just described would never have occurred were it not for the disgraceful attitude of this government in doing away with an ancient british tradition in industrial matters allowing an arbitrator or arbitrary hoard to decide the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether it would be possible for the representations of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter to be taken on board by the government and for representations along the lines which he has suggested to be adopted by the government and made to the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that if these proposals are to be taken seriously perhaps the british government along with our allies would make a fair challenge to the soviet government as to what are their views upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the quintessential of the submission in the original question of my noble friend lord brockway is probably the most vital issue facing mankind and is too great an issue to depend on even the most erudite civil servants brief or on fifth rate jokes <e> <s> does the noble lord also agree that if there is one nation in the united nations security council that could command support because of its experience and loyalty to that organisation it is the united kingdom <e> <s> no proposal whatever regarding the future of mankind should be ruled out as the noble lord ruled out this proposal as a non-starter <e> <s> will the noble lord reconsider that and also seriously consider the points that i have submitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord whether he would be prepared to examine the possibility of perhaps establishing a guidance council from the british pharmaceutical society to aid the government and the national health service in such matters as we have been discussing this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend would give way <e> <s> i am interested in what he said about the wolfenden committee of years ago <e> <s> can he explain to the house what were the charges under which many thousands of our fellow-countrymen were almost harried to the rack <e> <s> my noble friend is now saying that homosexuality is not a criminal offence <e> <s> what then were those people harried for in the courts of this land <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be indebted to the noble earl the minister for the manner in which he introduced this measure for us to fully understand what is involved <e> <s> we owe a great debt also to my noble friend lord elystan-morgan for the very sensitive manner with which he portrayed what was once a massive issue and now we have overcome it <e>", "<cs> my lords in cases where capital punishment has been carried out and subsequent posthumous pardons have been made would such instances come within the compass of this review <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i had in mind was where a person was arrested and was not necessarily in prison but in the days of capital punishment had his life taken from him and later on it was discovered that he was innocent <e> <s> ought not such cases also to come within the compass of this review <e> <s> when a posthumous pardon has been issued by her majesty and we as a nation have committed the unfortunate crime of hanging the wrong person ought not some award be made to the wife children whoever it might be of such a person <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally everybody will rejoice that the rate of inflation has been brought down but would not the noble lord acknowledge that although this government have brought down inflation they sent it rapidly rising within six months of taking office and that the corollary of their policy is that we have had a massive increase in unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that what he has just said is not entirely correct <e> <s> he has just said that they spurned the offer that is turned it down absolutely and said they would have no discussion no negotiations <e> <s> when the noble lord looks at the record i think he will find that that is not wholly true <e> <s> may i also put this to him will the review body cover the ancillary staffs and the ambulance crews <e> <s> will those very important people be included <e> <s> also will the noble lord not reconsider the offensive statement he made when he suggested to any neutral person listening to this discussion this afternoon that great britains nurses had been on total strike for the past seven months <e> <s> what happened is that because of the obdurate behaviour of this government they were driven to hold some small token strike <e> <s> that is the reality and this government then dived in with all the venom they possess to attack britains nurses <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree <e>", "<cs> but my lords this is terribly important <e> <s> i think the noble lord might have acknowledged the tucs code and the call of the confederation of health service employees to their members to see that there was adequate cover particularly for emergencies <e> <s> i confess that in some instances that call was disregarded but that was the plea of the trade unions <e> <s> the noble lord knows it and that the tuc backed it and he might have had a word to say in acknowledgement of that fact <e>", "<cs> my

and flowers <e> <s> the sadness he felt for the million unemployed and for the old-age pensioners who are going to be fiddled and cheated by this government next year <e> <s> that is a terrible thing to have to say in this house and no one will contradict me because that is what is going to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords that shows what a forthcoming young man the noble earl is because he is out for promotion <e> <s> after that brave effort i think he deserves it because when one looks at the facts he will be very embarrassed indeed <e> <s> we shall check that very carefully and we shall watch it <e> <s> i shall remind him of what he said today in this house and i suppose that that will mean his banishment from the front bench for ever for being so silly as to have interrupted me <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that in so far as this country is the head of a great multi-commonwealth we ought to continue to make transparently clear our abhorrence of the philosophy the evil philosophy of apartheid which is practised in south africa and that we have a duty indeed a responsibility continually to make that transparently clear in our almost unique role as the head of a great multi-commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that we are talking about one of the greatest facets of our constitution of which we are rightly proud <e> <s> are the government saying not so much to quote the bible out of the mouths of babes and sucklings as that they are afraid of the babes and sucklings <e> <s> does she recall that at one of our great universities before the war the students passed a resolution saying that they would not fight for king and country but that this did not apply to the mass of ordinary people <e> <s> surely we have enough confidence in ourselves and our children to allow them to realise that this is a serious matter and they ought to be permitted to consider it even at an early age <e> <s> there has been nothing like it before in the history of mankind <e>", "<cs> my lords may i at the outset offer my apologies to the noble lords on both sides of the house who will be winding up this debate <e> <s> because of the exigencies of political life i shall not be able to have the privilege of listening to their speeches but being an avid reader of <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that verification is quintessential in all these things <e> <s> because no matter what agreements are reached people will be suspicious of one another unless there are guaranteed results of proper verification <e> <s> therefore towards this end ought not the government perhaps to consider the establishment of a fully qualified independent body which could produce the fruits of verification to make disarmament an accepted reality throughout the world <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this question within the sphere of reorganisation is he aware that the closing of tadworth court hospital is causing great dismay and great perturbation not only within that particular area but as the national press of this country has revealed right throughout the nation <e> <s> therefore does he not think it despicable that the great ormond street hospital should be played off against the tadworth court hospital and the choice is that one will be severely cut back or the other abolished <e> <s> is he not aware that within the field of cystic fibrosis one of the most agonising complaints from which a child can suffer tadworth court has done so much <e> <s> may i plead with him to use his influence to get this decision stopped and allow tadworth court hospital to proceed with the magnificent work that it is doing on behalf of a portion of the children who are so stricken but still are members of our nation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister bearing in mind what he said about the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that during the application of the fares fair policy the number of passengers of london transport increased by per cent <e> <s> as did the amount of revenue <e> <s> there was also a marked reduction of traffic on londons roads <e> <s> would it not therefore be sensible to acknowledge that the fares fair policy was a huge success for all concerned and the government ought to have it reintroduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that answer which seems to indicate that there may be hope for both of these famous hospitals <e> <s> is the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister could clear up one point <e> <s> the people in charge of tadworth we are told whose views have to be taken fully into account are the governors <e> <s> it is the governors who are making this recommendation to the minister <e> <s> i am of the opinion that <e>", "<cs> is the minister aware that both i and thousands of other people are of the opinion that this matter would not have come to the minister had this not been a recommendation of the governors <e> <s> so the issue is their recommendation <e> <s> there is no evidence of their fighting it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that reply particularly the last part of it <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that there is still a great deal of bitterness and rancour felt by tens of thousands of employees of our national health service simply because of this issue <e> <s> is he aware that in other parts of public industry and private industry there exist national arbitration boards and that when the whitley system in these other industries reaches stalemate there is an agreement that such matters should be referred to the national arbitration board by either side and their decision is binding <e> <s> is the noble lord not aware that if this had been the situation in the national health service the bitterness and rancour and all the bad feeling that now exists need not have occurred <e> <s> is my proposal therefore not at least worthy of consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that it had nothing to do with the statement of the government that they could not accede to the present request of britains nurses and ancillary workers <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that when you have such a situation then instead of a massive wedge being driven between one side and the other there ought to be a system of conciliation which is traditional within british industry and could well be of great service to the national health service in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that when matters have been referred to existing national arbitration boards they have taken full cognisance of the views of both sides <e> <s> i do not know when there has been a single instance in which the national arbitration boards for various industries for example the railway industry have conceded the whole point of the employers or the whole point of the employees <e> <s> is the noble lord not aware that people who comprise these national arbitration boards in our country today are not abysmally stupid people they <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord perhaps in due course inform the house apropos the present clawback from the old-age pensioners how much of that clawback and of other reductions over the past <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether or not this relief applies to the steel industry <e> <s> if the government are serious about the re-establishment of our industrial base this would create a demand for british steel and both the public and private sectors of british steel could be assisted by the sort of thing that the noble lord has adumbrated this afternoon <e> <s> can he say whether it applies to them <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the noble lord agree that the whole point is simply that when the programme was established it was the result of consultation and co-operation between both houses of parliament and the bbc <e> <s> the bbc has decided unilaterally to make a dramatic change <e> <s> ought it not to be pointed out to the bbc that when it is making a change of this character it should adhere to the principle on which the programme was established <e>", "<cs> my lords in furtherance of the point raised by the noble baroness is the noble lord aware that in industry health and safety is one of the finest examples of joint co-operation between management and skilled artisans and that much has come out of it and with particular regard to emergencies for which drills are practised because of this co-operation would <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that earlier this year there was great consternation expressed in this chamber about the governments decision to cut back drastically the bbcs overseas broadcasts <e> <s> the bbc itself made protestations and so did all the responsible newspapers <e> <s> those cuts still <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will be prepared to check the coverage <e> <s> this is a vitally important sector i believe of the bbcs activities and much has been lost because of these cuts <e> <s> is the noble lord not aware that one cannot simply go on saying that the service is costing more because everything in this island has cost much more since we have had a conservative government <e> <s> that does not mean that standards have been maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say <e>", "<cs> i wish noble lords opposite would not wince before the lash comes <e> <s> can the noble lord say what will be the qualification required of the entrepreneurs who will compete with the british element and who will select them <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that it would be an appalling shame if the very existence of the soviet union should in any way prohibit any member of this house or another place or any other british person from making full use of our democratic facilities <e> <s> would he further agree that all the horrendous figures which have been quoted in this question time apply equally to citizens in the soviet union and america and that what is really wanted and perhaps our government could give a lead-is that there should be parliamentary concern expressed in the soviet union and equally the united states of america <e> <s> we should challenge them to do that so that perhaps we could band together to give humanity a lead away from the most probable of all holocausts and back to sanity <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that what made a massive contribution to overcoming the slump of the s and getting the unemployed employed was the building of technical colleges schools and hospitals by local authorities and that many of our most famous town halls were built during that period <e> <s> this made a massive contribution to overcoming the slump which we were then enduring <e> <s> would it therefore not be prudent for the government to increase what they are doing and to give even more encouragement to local authorities to spend and prosper <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a serious threat to the governments good intentions namely that if we do not save british steel then the enterprise zones and indeed the engineering trades covered in the first question this afternoon will all come to nought and the governments policy will simply end up in robbing peter to cheat paul <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister would be prepared to consider this <e> <s> in so far as i understand it he will tell me if i have got it wrong parliament and the government ordered this inquiry which will have very far-reaching effects as i am sure the noble lord appreciates <e> <s> would it therefore not be right and proper that the parliament which instructed the inquiry to be made should also have the right to deliberate upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the noble lord is absolutely correct but when identical and similar instances have occurred ministers have been requested by parliament that their reports should be available to be discussed and this is very rarely refused <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord the minister for that reply which seems encouraging except when it is put against the facts <e> <s> does he realise that every time we get a statement of that kind from the government some great hospital for example great ormond street and tadworth hospitals are put under threat <e> <s> at this very moment there are hospitals in glasgow and in particular the leukaemia wards under threat of closure <e> <s> there is the leukaemia ward in the east birmingham hospital which is now under threat of closure simply because they cannot find staff <e> <s> would the noble lord be prepared to look at the examples that i give and perhaps inform me that the fears i have expressed on behalf of those hospitals will not be realised or will they perhaps be realised <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in addition to the very valid point made by the noble baroness there is apprehension running through all grades of staff throughout the national health service <e> <s> as i have said they hear that there are to be improvements and that the nhs is safe in the hands of this government but within a few weeks of such statements there are threatened closures which stretch from surrey through london birmingham and glasgow <e> <s> will the minister please give some assurances on matters which are perturbing staff and patients about what appear to be promises made on the one hand and the reverse being applied when the promises have faded away <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this request by the lebanese government reflects great credit on the country and shows great confidence in the country <e> <s> i hope that that will be taken into consideration in further discussions <e> <s> in addition to that will the government also take into consideration the magnificent contribution made in this terribly dangerous area by the former prime minister the noble lord lord carrington <e>", "<cs> the noble lord made a remarkable contribution <e> <s> everybody involved was prepared to talk with and listen to him <e> <s> if this is now reflected in the governments decision possibly to send representations to the lebanon i believe that it will help solve the problem bearing in mind the great contribution that the former foreign secretary made <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there are some peers i would not allow to run a <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that his remarks concerning our commonwealth partner new zealand will be very welcome indeed <e> <s> i was pleased to hear that <e> <s> i wonder if he will bear in mind that we hope we shall not enter into the fiasco that was entered into a year ago with regard to eec surplus butter when this country and new zealand suffered when butter was sold to the soviet union at <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been for me an extraordinarily interesting debate because i thought that not being a lawyer all i could do was put the views of ordinary people <e> <s> then to my absolute delight i heard part of the speech that i had hoped to make and the theme of it put by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> i wish to comment on what he had to say later <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the basis of great britains industry can in no way recover without the british steel industry <e> <s> is he further aware that great britain has adhered to the edicts of the eec commission and has savagely reduced british steel production while other members of the commission have in no way adhered to those requests and indeed some of them are increasing their steel production which of course is bound to have a deleterious effect on great britains industry <e> <s> will the noble lord say what the government are going to do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble minister aware that i am not particularly and i do not think that the british steel industry both private and public are very much concerned whether or not now we adhere to any eec edicts from their commission when it makes no endeavour or effort to get other countries to comply with them but seems to concentrate on great britain <e> <s> the fact of the matter therefore is that our government ought to concentrate on seeing that the great needs of our nation which can be provided on the basis of british steel are given top priority and that that great industry ought also to be given top priority to provide a successful future for british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that when he read out the percentage figures of increases paid to metallurgists and skilled steel workers in various countries the increase that the british received still keeps them well below half what other nations pay their steel workers <e> <s> therefore the house must not be misled <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is making a point against management he may have a good point but i think the house could be forgiven if we think that what he meant was that the wicked workers had had a massive increase of over per cent <e> <s> and that that was the cause of the plight in which we find ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords while this exercise on behalf of the dhss was no doubt designed to try to reduce the cheating which goes on and which amounts to some million a year may i ask the noble lord to explain the sense of carrying on in this way to recover million while at the same time reducing the inland revenues staff who are working on the black economy which is now running at billion <e>", "<cs> tell us what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that involved here is a question of the morale of our country <e> <s> many people are greatly concerned they have seen all of this before <e> <s> as my noble friend lord blyton said the government first of all created the unemployed and now they are whipping them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the noble lord and ask him whether he is aware that many of us fully acknowledge his considerable knowledge of local government affairs but hope that he for one will not take the view that you simply become anti a particular local authority because you do not like its politics <e> <s> is he further aware that when the conservative government abolished the lcc they also abolished two tiers of most efficient government the london boroughs and the lcc <e> <s> if as the noble lord has said he is taking advice on this matter will he consider that perhaps the restoration of the london boroughs and the lcc would make a massive improvement to the current set-up <e>", "<cs> my lords if as the noble lord the minister has said the soviet union have a massive preponderance of nuclear weapons over the west one could understand it if they did not wish to enter into any form of negotiation to reduce what they have got <e>", "<cs> or is it that they are such very good sports that they are going to wait until the massive preponderance they have has withered away <e> <s> is the noble lord also aware that in very recent times there has been evidence produced by very experienced people that the monitoring of reductions of nuclear weapons is now almost a firm possibility <e> <s> bearing all that in mind ought not we in this country to do our best to influence both the americans and the russians to talk seriously and to start implementing a reduction in these horrible and fearful weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the strong feeling on the other side of the house that post office workers should be working on sundays may i ask the noble lord whether he will seek to clarify how many members on the other side of the house will be prepared to come to this chamber on a sunday morning and set an example to the post office workers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i preface my question to the noble baroness the leader of the house with a statement of the fact that she can in no way give any answer this afternoon apropos the leaks that have appeared at the weekend in british newspapers <e> <s> having listened to her statement they seem to be remarkably accurate <e> <s> what is disturbing and distressing is that this remarkable anticipation of the franks report has now found its way into the newspapers of other nations before we in great britain in this chamber could hear the statement this afternoon <e> <s> may i ask the noble baroness whether she would consider and it would be absolutely irresponsible of anyone to expect a reply this afternoon the remarks that have been made by myself and my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in something of a predicament because when the noble lord spoke on his motion the gravamen of his case was that my noble friends question gave an opinion <e> <s> but only yesterday we had what seemed to me to be a very harsh opinion in a question from the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter when his wording demonstrated beyond all peradventure his opinion that he wanted the glc to be abolished <e> <s> what is the difference between the opinion expressed yesterday and the opinion which it would appear is causing all the trouble today <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to begin by thanking my noble friend lord glenamara not only for introducing this debate but for the manner in which he did so the very able contribution he made <e> <s> i wish also to thank the noble lord lord perry of walton for the frank admission with which he prefaced his speech one can understand some of the absurdities he uttered and can forgive him in view of his admission that for many years he was isolated from the hurly-burly of ordinary life in the cloisters of some university <e> <s> all he need do is to look at the facts and figures the creation of comprehensive education was by the labour party and the biggest injection of cash in the history of the nation for education was made by a labour government <e>", "<cs> i was aware of that my lords but the noble lord seemed to see no difference between a tory government and a labour government and of course there are none so blind as those who will not see <e> <s> however i must resist the temptation to reply to many of the points that have been made <e> <s> i have listened to what has been an extraordinary debate in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that that is a most ambiguous statement and helps no one <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that over the past months the government have strenuously sought to find a lasting peace in the middle east that this government have sought to stop the killing and slaying and atrocities and that both the former foreign secretary and the present foreign secretary have declared unequivocally that no examination of the situation to achieve a lasting peace can be undertaken without the participation of the leaders of the plo <e> <s> is he further aware that following the first statement when the arab countries decided to see the leaders of the security council of the united nations our country was high on this list and that they were faced with almost an ultimatum from some where <e>", "<cs> and one does not know whether it was from the foreign office or from downing street <e>", "<cs> is he further aware that there is a possibility that this country will lose a great opportunity to make its contribution to achieve peace for all in the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord lord skelmersdale aware that what many of us on both sides of this house seek is a march towards peace and to stop the massacres which have occurred in the lebanon from ever happening again and that jews and arabs not yet born shall be left without that hatred in them to hurt one another and to be at each others throats <e> <s> is there not a danger if we do not agree to see the plo in the arab delegation <e> <s> as president reagan himself has said <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the point raised by the noble baroness lady <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to follow the example of the noble viscount lord hanworth who said that much of what he anticipated he would say had already been said <e> <s> there have been quite a number of remarkable speeches <e> <s> i thought that the examination made by noble friend the leader of the opposition lord cledwyn was admirable fair and just <e> <s> because it was admirable fair and just and truthful quite naturally it annoyed the benches opposite <e> <s> if it had been lacking in spirit or determination the noble lord would probably have sat down to a few muffled cheers from the conservative benches <e>", "<cs> of course i believe that my lords but i was trying to say that because of that threat and in view of the threat that was made when the falklands issue began perhaps we should take a little longer in arriving at a peaceful situation and follow the sane policy of the noble lord lord carrington to talk talk and talk until we arrive at a solution <e> <s> to the noble lord lord chalfont i shall just say that it will be much more important to carry out the policies which the noble lord lord carrington endeavoured to get the british people to understand if there should ever be a dangerous situation involving the soviet union more so than in the case of the falklands campaign <e> <s> i hope that this house will thoroughly endorse that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as i understand the noble baroness she could not have heard the first part of what i said about the admirable support we had from our allies particularly the usa <e> <s> later there was a dwindling of that support there was a confusion <e> <s> indeed general haig resigned <e> <s> i think that proves what i am trying to say that they did not really understand the difficulties of being an honest broker between a fascist rgime and an ancient democratic regime like ours <e> <s> like our foreign secretary their secretary of state paid a very full price indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i cannot let the noble lord get away with that <e> <s> let him read <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the irritants was that the government did not apply that criteria to the police the forces and many others they applied it simply to those working in the nhs <e> <s> as i say the forces the police and other ministry-controlled institutions did not have that yoke placed on them <e> <s> they selected to put that yoke only on the nhs <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it fair to say that we have had a very useful and constructive debate <e> <s> i only wish i had the full right of reply for another minutes but of course i do not <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for his very full response to the points that were raised in this debate and to congratulate him on his anticipation <e> <s> i am pleased in particular because of the seriousness with which the noble lord lord trefgarne treats these debates when he has to respond to them <e> <s> also i thank my noble friend lord wallace for his piercing examination of many points which i had not made but for which i am grateful the noble lord lord winstanley for his experience and knowledge which he makes available to us all and the noble lord lord auckland with his considerable knowledge drawn through family contacts and family links very similar to my own <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that that is a most encouraging reply and i sincerely hope that her majestys government will pursue even more strongly the making of these representations <e> <s> because president reagans resumption of the sale of arms to guatemala constitutes a threat to belize and has been condemned by many of his own congressmen by human rights observers and is giving cause for grave concern to many people in our own country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the united states struck guatemala off its list for receiving armaments and that therefore they should do it again <e> <s> is he further aware that the american anthropological society in a recent report to its own government reported on genocidal action in guatemala <e> <s> if such a regime should carry on like that with its own people what price the people for whom we have responsibility in belize <e> <s> therefore will the government please maintain the strongest possible pressure to stop american military aid going to guatemala <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one must admit that the closing of industrial training centres is perfectly congruous to the governments policy of ruining the british economy <e> <s> is he aware however that one day there might be another government who will restore our economy <e> <s> therefore should not some semblance of the industrial training boards and the centres be kept if only for that purpose in other words because we shall not be going downhill all the time and there will be a return to the need for industrial training boards for the benefit of the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble earl say what representations he or the government have <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the house should take full cognisance of the contributions of the three noble baronesses because we have been listening to three ladies with enormous experience <e>", "<cs> four <e> <s> i am of the opinion that unless something drastic is done we are going to strangle the financial and administrative aspects of our national health service by this incredible miniature over-bureaucracy at regional level <e> <s> i think it fair to say that if the ministry of defence ran their business in the same way as the dhss runs the national health service we should find great difficulty in making an assault across the round pond in kensington <e> <s> this has to be taken seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that these proposals could create severe difficulties for many of our young people in getting to university which means to say that the proposition could very well limit access to higher education <e> <s> ought there not to be full discussions before anything like this is implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that because of the statements which have emanated from the des and indeed from the secretary of state himself there is some consternation not only among the -odd students and their parents but among all those who are interested in education <e> <s> ought not the government to come clean and state precisely what they have in mind so that there can be proper consultations and a proper examination of a proposal which is giving great concern right through the whole fabric of higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i am grateful to the noble earl for the reply he has given particularly as he has said that everybody will be consulted <e> <s> would he please give the house an assurance that representatives of the national union of students will be included because as i understand it they look upon the issue as being one of saving money and they have proposals which need not be of the same type as the governments but which nevertheless could save money and which would be acceptable to the nus <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his reply will give massive encouragement to everybody all over the world human beings of different skins and different blood mixtures because they will know that the government of this island is still paramount in preserving the rights of ordinary people against the most vile rgime far more vile than that of the soviet union that we have ever had to deal with <e>", "<cs> people know full well that even if they cannot agree with the communism of the ussr they are not picked on because of the colour of their skins <e> <s> that is why our government can win with their attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that detailed information for which i am most grateful <e> <s> could he please say whether the costs of this exhibition will be borne to some degree by some of the companies concerned and not merely from the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put to the noble lord a proposition <e> <s> in so far as a remarkable amount of administrative information must be gained and probably more ability accrued through the floating arms system can this be used in the future for example by the board of trade for exhibitions of the same style of other great british manufactures which are not necessarily arms <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding the plethora of statements included in the one statement one important element is still missing <e> <s> what is the governments policy with regard to that part of british telecommunications activities which are strictly related to the british armed forces and are classified as top secret <e> <s> will they be guaranteed so that there are no leaks and nothing slips by which might endanger this nation after privatisation takes place <e> <s> that is a fair question which demands an answer if not today then later on <e> <s> secondly will the massive amount of research that goes on and has been going on in british telecommunications in the name of the british people also be safeguarded and not given as gifts to private entrepreneurs as has happened in private medicine which in the main has been provided with the results of the research of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to say whether there will be an <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the current foreign secretary mr pym along with president mitterand and many of our fellow members of the eec on the lead given by the former foreign secretary lord carrington who stated this at all times has said that to stop the horrible situation and the slaughter that is going on in the middle east it is inevitable that at some time we shall have to make certain that the plo are represented at any conference as the only representatives of the palestinian people and refugees <e> <s> would it not be a good thing for an effort to be made to make that policy a reality in the interests of peace and understanding <e>",

researched maiden speech for which we are all most grateful <e> <s> we shall be pleased to hear from him in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord lord trefgarne for that reply may i ask whether there was any discussion in government and with the bank of england and was there immediate endorsement that this action should be taken <e> <s> can he explain to me and to the house how all this fits in <e> <s> are there any restrictions such as that the argentine will not use our portion of the money to buy exocets or frigates as they are going to do from west germany <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister say quite clearly that in the interests of our people in the interests of our armed forces and in the interests of those who are still in hospital and wounded none of this money will be used in a way which is contrary to the policy of a fortress falklands and can in no way be used to maim and slay british troops in the future if matters do not go properly and correctly as we hope they will <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister will answer at least one part of my original supplementary question <e> <s> was there any resistance by officials of the bank of england what was the role for example of lloyds bank and did british bankers not express grave apprehension in respect of this particular exercise <e> <s> the public have a right to know where these people who have so much power and authority stand in this issue <e> <s> did they acquiesce or did they object <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that what ought to be examined in great depth and thoroughness in the interests of the british forces in the islands servicemen and women and the islanders is what transpired in the short question and answer period on the first question this afternoon <e> <s> the totally unsatisfactory nature of the answers must have caused grave distress to people on the falkland islands and to the people who might be going there to help to defend them <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the serious point raised by the noble lord lord orr-ewing in his supplementary question this afternoon does the noble lord really wish to leave that is his reply to my question the possibility of british money going to the argentine which could be used for arms against the falkland islands and british forces <e> <s> is it a jocular issue on the conservative benches <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be prepared to consider this <e> <s> in so far as we are technically in a state of war with the argentine and i think that the british government genuinely want to arrive at some <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the right reverend prelate <e> <s> may i put this to him as it is a point which worries very many sincere christians who see the possible advantage of our using nuclear weapons first when the soviet union could crash through western germany <e> <s> would we then be good christians to drop our medium-range missiles and atomic weapons in an endeavour to wipe out the russians and also wipe out millions of innocent germans <e> <s> that is the problem which faces many of them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord campbell of alloway was entitled to make his political speech <e> <s> one would expect him to attack the labour party and as usual he filled his speech with a cross-section of nonsense and contrary argument <e> <s> the noble lord said that there were so many views in the labour party that he wished to know where the party stands <e> <s> the last thing that he said was that the labour party was suffering from following one dogma <e> <s> if <e>", "<cs> when i have finished saying this my lords <e> <s> one conservative peer thought it was absolutely wrong of her majestys opposition to oppose her majestys government <e> <s> there is still that broad feeling in some of the contributions we have heard today <e> <s> i will give way now <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for what he has said my lords but anyone listening to the tail end of his speech would have said at least that he is not particularly enamoured of either the liberal party or the labour party <e> <s> that is the impression i had <e> <s> i do not know what was the contribution of the peers behind him as there is none the noble lord must be some kind of miraculous ventriloquist <e>", "<cs> my lords but when they were having their debate the synod should have been aware of that <e> <s> that was something they should have raised <e> <s> i think that some of the clerics proposed in the end that in no way would they use nuclear weapons first <e> <s> if that is so those of that synod can in no way support the present government <e> <s> that is the fundamental issue <e> <s> but there are other conferences that have been taking place which are just as important <e> <s> there have been discussions among baptists methodists non-conformists which are of equal importance <e> <s> time does not allow me to go into the details of them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the leader of the house aware that the reasons why this tribunal was established were most depressing for those of us who read the initial reasons for it being set up <e> <s> would she please tell the house whether the government are satisfied with the recommendations of the tribunal and that what happened to cause the tribunal to be set up will not happen again <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble lord the lord chancellor can help me <e> <s> normally one can follow the submissions of the noble and learned lord in general debate and understand precisely what the noble and learned lord has to say one does not have to agree with the noble and learned lord but at least one understands what he is saying <e> <s> but there are exceptions to every rule <e> <s> i listened to his submission just now <e> <s> i can follow it as far as a lay person can but when he says let us suppose that all the data has gone by fire or flood or for some other reason has vanished that in my judgment would be a good thing for it would have gone for good and for ever <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the very last point that the noble lord the minister has made perhaps i may ask this question would he agree that while it is generally acknowledged that the major participants are the ussr and the usa and that as he has just said the soviet union have a massive preponderance in these horrendous weapons over all else and all others it is therefore vital that these talks should not break down <e> <s> also would he agree that the great role that britain can play is trying to achieve that and maintain the negotiations show patience because the prize is so worthwhile so that something realistic will emerge in the end to make a contribution to the slow crawl back to sanity for all the nations involved <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord please tell us what is the difference between the rates of interest of our contribution and the millions that we have just loaned the argentine and those which british industrials have to pay <e>", "<cs> we have my lords <e>", "<cs> may i respond to some of the points that the noble lord has made <e> <s> i believe it is vital that a response should be made <e> <s> first and foremost all that he outlined was a proposition that was made in the manifesto of the london labour party for which the people voted <e> <s> i do not believe one can come along to this chamber and say that the people of london ought not to have voted for these things particularly in the field of transport <e> <s> when we get to that frontier we are very near what is happening in parts of the world which all of us in this chamber despise that where there is a glimmer of democracy there is some reason given to crush it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord bellwin can help me <e> <s> i followed his exposition and argument very closely and it seemed to me that perhaps a fair analogy with what the noble lord was saying is this <e> <s> the chancellor of the exchequer we all know does not give every small detail of his budget <e> <s> that is worked out by top-flight civil servants <e> <s> therefore according to the noble lord those top-flight civil servants in the treasury have a certain degree of responsibility for the budget as much as the chancellor has <e> <s> they would recommend things which he would have to accept <e> <s> i do not believe that for one minute <e> <s> therefore if the principle has to be adopted all the way down we have to realise that the executives are employed by permission of act of parliament by the local authorities the moment that we start giving those who are employed by the elected representatives a degree of authority which appears to be outside the normal scope of behaviour of either national or local government it seems to me that we are starting towards a process which would not merely be undemocratic but exceedingly dangerous <e>", "<cs> will the minister consider this very vital aspect in this bill as it stands and probably in no other bill passed by any parliament there is one group of people i beg your lordships to listen to this argument employed by a local authority which will have an advantage that town clerks deputy town clerks planning officers or anyone will not have <e> <s> it will if this bill goes through without the amendment be able to challenge the elected authority by the words of an act of parliament <e> <s> i refer to the executives <e> <s> we should leave it as the amendment proposes and which would fit into the argument submitted by the noble lord lord bellwin just as much as it would fit into the argument as submitted by my noble friend lord underhill <e> <s> we must look at it in the context of the bill giving special provision for only one group of people employed by a local authority who could challenge <e>", "<cs> it can be challenged <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree in so far as he has implied that from the british <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister also appreciate that it is extraordinarily difficult for mothers and fathers alive today whose sons were mutilated and slain to accept that dictum very easily <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness the leader of the house not agree that it is a fundamental responsibility of any government to see that matters which are highly secret are kept that way in the interest of the ordinary citizens of this country and that such action must be taken almost every minute of every day <e> <s> also can the noble baroness say that whenever this nation of ours has been sadly betrayed over the past years any members of the communist party were involved or were some of them not accepted members of what is known as the establishment from some of our universities <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he would be prepared also to recommend to the secretary of state that he should point out to the inquiring body that the fundamental feature ought to be that all doctors nurses specialists of all kinds and ancillary and ambulance staffs should be provided with conditions of work that will create a great harmony which will be of benefit and increase the efficiency of our national health service to our fellow countrymen <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that reformation and examination of the whitley councils their scope broadened must be part of the examining inquirys writ <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble minister when he is making this examination bear in mind that the wages councils succeeded the old trade halls in <e> <s> the reason for their establishment was to see that anyone who did not have the cover of a trade union was not exploited <e> <s> young people were being ruthlessly exploited <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord also bear in mind that the creation of wages councils was to stop ruthless exploitation of our fellow citizens by extreme conservatives <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say what was the percentage reduction in that part of the inland revenue engaged in trying to recoup money lost on the black economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be read a second time <e> <s> as i am sure your lordships are aware the purpose of this little bill is to recognise the exhortation of the secretary of state for employment in another place that the unemployed should make every endeavour to find and should travel to look for work he used the expression that like their fathers they should get on their bikes <e> <s> i believe he made that exhortation because of research that has been done and i do not think he said it frivolously <e> <s> if he did this bill would deserve to be treated in a frivolous manner <e> <s> i think he knows the problems facing the unemployed our fellow countrymen robbed of the ability to earn a living as their numbers have grown by tens of thousands month in and month out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> i have to point out to the house that i could have had this second reading debate before the transport bill got here <e> <s> i was asked to delay it by the government whips office and i co-operated <e> <s> for co-operation should i receive punishment <e> <s> what sort of behaviour is that in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord please give me a small answer to one small question <e> <s> he is the author of a wrecking amendment <e> <s> i have never realised that he was privy to what a minister of the crown was going to say <e> <s> i am not so but he said so <e> <s> he asked us to listen to what the minister says <e> <s> he must know what the minister is going to say <e> <s> i do not think that that is fair <e>", "<cs> my lords i deeply and most sincerely regret that because of the cheating and the chicanery of the government front bench and the governments whips office a bitterness has crept into this debate <e> <s> let me say to the noble earl lord halsbury he has <e>", "<cs> no my lords i have too much to say <e> <s> it is my turn now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply grateful to the noble lord for that contribution <e> <s> but when you have lived a tough life and have never lost faith in your nation despite the temptations of other hideous philosophies which you have fought and you come to a house like this and think that you can be subjected to the type of behaviour to which i am being subjected then i find it distasteful <e> <s> surely everyone knows full well that the government lacked the guts to get up and say that they were against the bill <e> <s> they got the noble lord lord nugent to do it and he slipped up because he told us almost what the noble lord lord lucas was going to say <e> <s> is that the behaviour of the gentlemen of england <e> <s> i am glad i do not belong to your club because that is highly distasteful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful indeed to the noble lord for that explanation which i accept fully without any question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that time is passing <e> <s> it would appear that the government are giving thought to certain considerations and have made promises that they will look at this matter but they seem to be taking a very long time to arrive at a decision <e> <s> this is causing some concern not merely in the legislative council of the falklands islands but particularly among the young who wish to carve out a career for themselves the only way in which they can do that is for half the land which is now owned by the falkland islands company to be shared among them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that what this is primarily relative to and i shall try to make him understand this is the future of the young falkland islanders <e> <s> as sir rex hunt has said there is a disturbing exodus of young falkland islanders because they cannot get land <e> <s> sir rex hunt has said the legislative council is willing to take land into public ownership by means of compulsory purchase to <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord aware i hope that that is not superfluous that only last month the foreign secretary stated in a broadcast on the bbc that this proposal was having the active consideration of the government <e> <s> that was repeated only a few weeks ago by mr cranley onslow in the other place <e> <s> can the noble lord say that these proposals emanating from the legislative chamber for them to be assisted will be made the reality <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble earl the minister agree that it is a very grim situation where we have to refer to redundant apprentices <e> <s> would he not agree that we are approaching the most barren of balances <e> <s> skilled craftsmen and skilled technicians are losing their jobs and as the noble earl said would-be apprentices are redundant before they even start work <e> <s> have the government any plans in mind to try to arrest such a situation in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express my gratitude for the detailed information that the noble earl has given the house <e> <s> may i ask whether he would be prepared to consider that information of the kind that he has given to the house be made available as widely as possible including to both sides of industry so that on that basis regional councils might be established covering industries as they vary from one part of the country to another <e> <s> if that were done then when the government bring into force what the noble earl enunciated a moment ago people will be ready to take full advantage of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that many of these folk who have to submit applications have to send with their papers their passport birth certificate and where applicable their marriage lines <e> <s> to be without these documents for some time can be inconvenient <e> <s> noble lords will appreciate that when we surrender something it seems that the next day we require those documents for something <e> <s> particularly so far as passports are concerned commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble lord is at it will he congratulate all those people probably running into tens of thousands of commonwealth citizens who have always been part of us but now want to confirm being part of us <e> <s> is he further aware that when he talks about a number of pages there is one page on a birth certificate and there is one page on marriage lines <e> <s> he should tell the civil servant who wrote that answer for him these simple facts <e> <s> regarding passports the quintessential part required in other areas of this country for proof purposes is the very first page on which is stated the age of the subject to whom the passport belongs and for how long it is valid <e> <s> if the noble lord really is prepared to consider seriously what i am suggesting i am sure that he will receive the thanks of tens of thousands of our commonwealth citizens who are acting swiftly to fulfil their desire to be british citizens and the bureaucrats are holding them up from doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i did that <e> <s> it took me seconds flat because there was no one else there <e> <s> if he would like me to give his department a few hints i am prepared to do so for a reasonable understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make one submission which has not been made yet and which in my judgment is primary above all that have been made <e> <s> this amendment as my noble friend has said is a reasonable proposition <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter submitted that if the word reasonable was included it would be a good thing <e> <s> now comes the question a good thing for whom <e> <s> the executive not at all the nbc not at all the minister of state not at all <e> <s> above all these are the british people for whom this bill is being directed to provide <e> <s> our responsibility in this chamber is to put them first above national bus companies above executives yes even above ourselves and the secretary of state <e> <s> if that is the quintessential nature of what our endeavours <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to detain your lordships for too long <e> <s> i wish to make only one point <e> <s> since we last discussed this issue a few thousand more of our fellow britons have been deprived of the right to earn a livelihood <e> <s> when i listen to debates in this place i sometimes think that it is the fault of the unemployed that they are on the dole it is their fault that they are unable to find work and have gainful employment <e> <s> we have to take these matters into consideration because there is a large festering sore of bitterness in our country <e> <s> according to my mail that sore has turned gangrenous throughout this nation because of the way that the issue was treated in this house on the last two occasions <e> <s> different reasons have been given for the opposition to it but the united endeavour has been not to give a briton of this country one hapenny to go and look for work despite the fact that he was exhorted so to do by one of her majestys ministers the secretary of state <e> <s> people are asking which bunch of you democratic politicians are we to believe <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the difference my lords <e> <s> i am saying that the kernel of the submission is the search for work <e> <s> that is the whole point <e> <s> i will not accept the argument that if there were some heavenly host examining the proposition of the founder of the christian religion and of the good samaritan it would be rejected on the basis that the good samaritan was the last sort of person to have been brought into this proposition <e> <s> if this house accepts that then let us stop having prayers before we meet each day or we shall have reached the apotheosis of hypocrisy <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will allow me i meant that when one says this man is unemployed it should be remembered that often he is not in fact alone but has a wife and children <e> <s> his wife <e>", "<cs> but my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that if such a scheme were introduced it would have the harmful effect of commencing a division between the children of our nation and that instead of working towards the great ideal of disraeli of one nation this would set us back to the days of two nations <e> <s> therefore would he be prepared to consider making a recommendation to his right honourable friend that the proposal ought to be dropped in the interests of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord lord lyell also write to my noble friend lord beswick <e> <s> those who were following the discussion with great interest were disappointed that the noble lord lord lyell could not give an answer to a very vital aspect of my noble friends question relating to imports <e> <s> will the noble lord lord lyell write to my noble friend as well <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as there is grave concern throughout the country and i think there is also deep concern in this chamber regarding the central issue of my noble friends question will the minister please write to the senior authorities of the british council in south africa drawing their attention to this question and answer period this afternoon and asking them if they will be kind enough to provide their comments which possibly he could then make as a statement in <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl the minister not accept that the point raised by the noble lord lord gainford is indeed vital in so far as all parts of the media seem to concentrate on the deleterious effects of school activities <e> <s> the noble lord lord hunt also raised a very important point and here i speak with considerable experience having started such a scheme in the london borough of ealing involving young policemen becoming associated with as many schools as possible in the borough <e> <s> this had a beneficial effect on the students and it acted as a deterrent to those who were trying to damage schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply and i can understand a part of it but this is an ongoing business with the british commonwealth of nations of which i am a passionate supporter <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the present world crisis to which we are moving the industrial crisis and related matters might call for something special to be done within the british commonwealth which could be of benefit to the commonwealth and possibly the rest of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has mentioned the meeting of commonwealth finance ministers and the other ongoing meetings of the british commonwealth <e> <s> would he not agree that with all the researches that are going on to which he has referred and the possibility of the world summit next month it might then be the correct and judicious moment for the british commonwealth to have its summit to see how it can fit into all these proposals and make its contribution to the whole of mankind which i happen to believe it most certainly can <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that when the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter raised this matter in the house he was correct <e> <s> there was almost total chaos <e>

happening <e> <s> as the scheme has developed and is now reaching fruition the position seems to be improving dramatically <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble minister for that reply <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate our government on their very strong endeavours because it seems to me that our government more than anyone else acknowledge the fact that the situation in the middle east could be a flash point for a world war <e> <s> is the noble lord aware and would he not agree that the fundamentals that we must first achieve if we are not to allow the bawlings of the past to drown the whispers of a civilised solution for the future are that the state of israel must be recognized <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not accept that it is a fact that president reagans initiative was only partially accepted by the arab leaders but that it was indeed totally rejected by mr <e> <s> begin although not by any means by all the people in israel many of whom want to see a just peace as much as anyone in this world <e> <s> will he further agree that perhaps the only way in which to do that is to follow the example given by many brave israelis of having a world conference if you like to help them whereby the state of israel can be guaranteed its future just as much as the return of arab lands will be guaranteed and the creation of a palestinian state <e> <s> this is the only formula that will stop the death and destruction that periodically erupts in the middle east

"<cs> have no answer whatsoever to unemployment <e> <s> would the noble earl agree that what made this scheme possible and i beg noble lords to listen to this was the policy of her majestys government which has thrown nearly million out of work and cannot find gainful employment for a large proportion of the youth of this country <e> <s> if it were not for the massive failure of this government <e>", "<cs> to provide employment for youth in the first place this scheme would be of no use whatsoever <e> <s> but there were alternatives which the government could have used <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that the prime minister herself turned down a scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate what the i noble earl has said and i know his embarrassment <e>", "<cs> then my lords may i ask one final question <e> <s> can the minister say when these young men who enter this scheme will be returned to normal gainful employment to the real benefit of our nation <e>", "<cs> my lords much of what i wanted to say has already been said by the noble lord who spoke for the liberal party <e> <s> however i wish to make one or two points which i hope the noble lord will take on board and answer

is going to be used judiciously <e> <s> it cannot be used per cent <e> <s> judiciously <e> <s> the very existence of the bill means that the peoples money which has been paid to the treasury over the years is going to be dished out to a few privileged persons <e> <s> in my judgment this in itself is almost a criminal act <e> <s> nevertheless we on this side of the house have got to look at what we

agree that the recent paper published by the british veterinary association would make a sound basis for the amendments that are required to that ancient act <e>", "<cs> my lords may i underline two points very quickly to the noble lord <e> <s> is he aware that one of the primary concerns of the veterinary surgeons is that the places where animals are kept and not just the laboratories should also be subject to veterinary inspection <e> <s> my last point is that there is also the concern of ordinary folk who lose pets who know full well that they have been stolen that there seems to be reasonable evidence as to why they have been stolen <e> <s> i believe that this aspect too should receive consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords it would appear that what the noble lord has enunciated this afternoon will require an act of parliament <e> <s> it also appears that in anticipation of that act of parliament the government will proceed on certain lines <e> <s> this seems to me to be a remarkable course <e> <s> what the noble lord has enunciated seems to be a reasonable proposition <e> <s> but would he not agree that if we can have the debate first and if parliament can examine these matters the great advantage is that that occasion also provides an opportunity for ordinary people and a variety of associations to submit their observations and to write to members of the other house and to members of this house which then helps us all to contribute to what might be proposed <e> <s> would he not agree that such a proposal might be submitted to his right honourable friend for consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the government without commitment would consider discussing this matter with probably the best informed voluntary organisation apropos these matters the royal british legion <e> <s> if they were to discuss this matter with the royal british legion i am sure they would get full co-operation and sensible guidance in this situation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that in so far as it was this nation which helped in the creation of nato and bearing in mind that we have been realistic ever since with these horrendous weapons now in existence ought not the voice of britain be heard at major disarmament conferences if only to challenge and expose when necessary the soviet union and to put right some of the errors of our major allies such as the americans so that we with our background and experience can make a useful contribution not only to verification itself but to setting the world on the road to disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that all the unctad conferences for the past decade have been full of very good ideas when the conferences have been going on but that very little has been implemented afterwards <e> <s> will the noble lord be prepared to consider that after the forthcoming unctad conference we have our own british conference to examine what really

would it not be a reasonable idea to consult them to see to what extent we can make a reality of some of the resolutions of unctad <e>", "<cs> it is of great importance that we should realise what a

lords position tonight <e> <s> he has to resist the amendment <e> <s> but could not the noble lord at least say that there are to be further stages of the bill <e> <s> there are members on all sides of the committee who are anxious about this subsection if there is to be no amendment <e> <s> therefore if the government cannot accept the amendment now can they say that they will be prepared to look at some of the serious arguments which have been advanced in support of this amendment and will then come back with some <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that reply may i ask when we can expect to have the governments view on the rayner report which includes the need to modernise our coastal radio stations <e> <s> will he say what will be the effect we hope it will be beneficial on the voluntary lifeboat system if some of its recommendations are accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that although it may strictly be independent the volunteers who give such magnificent service in the life-boat system believe that the nation should at least subscribe to testing and examining boats which are used to rescue other people and which sometimes fail and cost the lives of those volunteers <e> <s> will the noble lord not agree that everything should be done to prevent such disasters as those that occurred in the mumbles in and as recently as last year in devonshire if this is possible by providing better life-boats <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect it has always been acknowledged right round the coast that there is an inextricable link between the voluntary lifeboat service the radio stations and everything else connected with this matter <e> <s> therefore are the government not prepared to consider that there is a link which they could acknowledge and which they could help wherever possible <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord and the party opposite not agree that on the question of nuclear war there is at least a serious element and that perhaps they might attune their minds to that particular element before we conclude this question time <e> <s> for example will the noble lord not agree that what perturbs many people here and some of the people of our ally nations is the submission during the last big debate that if there was an emergent invasion through germany to france in order to protect herself great britain would attempt to wipe out russian armies with nuclear weapons which would have devastating effects on the civil populations of nato countries <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that history seems to reveal that the best recruiting sergeant for the communist party in great britain has always been an extreme right-wing government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for his reply <e> <s> nevertheless is he aware that there is still some apprehension regarding this particular policy pursued by both governments <e> <s> can he tell the house what actual arrangements take place to ensure that the installation of these nuclear weapons is safe and that as far as possible any possibility of accident is removed <e> <s> what consultations take place with regard to the land that is taken over for these weapons to be installed <e> <s> thirdly can the noble lord please tell the house what progress has been made on achieving the dual key procedure in the event of real hostilities in which those weapons could be used <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that there are situations developing in southern america and other parts of the world that could not inconceivably cause a clash between the soviet union and the united states of america which would not necessarily involve great britain <e> <s> there could be a loosing of nuclear weapons <e> <s> would there be then the possibility of a situation arising of united states nuclear weapons on our soil being used against an enemy with whom we are not at war <e> <s> therefore in these circumstances would the noble lord agree that the tiny chink of light which has come from mr andropovs proposals ought now to be pursued as that is the only possible way in which we might prevent the possibilities that i have outlined becoming a terrible reality <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i have listened with some fascination to his speech bringing back memories of the thirties and speculating on what will happen if some of the courses which he has interpreted were to be labour party policy for instance disrupting the gatt and leaving the common market <e> <s> we are in the most disastrous situation we have ever been in since the end of the war we are adhering to the gatt and we are still in the common market <e> <s> that is what this debate is about <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first apologise to the house and to the noble lord lord ezra and my noble friend lord gallacher as for the last seconds of the speech of the noble lord lord ezra and the first few seconds of the speech of my noble friend lord gallacher i was seized with a discomfiture which compelled me to leave the chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely what has been happening in the last three or four years and i must acknowledge the courage of the noble viscount to have said it <e> <s> but we cannot swing it all the way back and say that the men who returned to this country in under the leadership of a labour government who started to build the welfare state which became the envy of the world who started to create the principle of full employment who introduced a new deal on education and who introduced the national health service within a few years of the most disastrous war in the history of mankind did not do so well <e> <s> i do not think that that is either a decent or an honest argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that is correct <e> <s> i only grieve having listened to the speech of the noble lord lord ezra that he did not stay to listen to mine <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord also read the figures of these hundreds of thousands of firms who are now going to be helped and resuscitated who were strangled a few years before under the same government <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is the case as the noble minister has said the british having said categorically that anything within the -mile radius of the fleet would suffer attack and the belgrano being miles away from that -mile radius who then gave the instruction to disobey that word of honour of the british public <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the policy of the government is to enhance the employment possibility but in their endeavours to do that they say that people aged over who are unemployed shall not be counted in the figures <e> <s> therefore are we to understand that if they drop that to people aged over who would be out of work then britains creation of unemployment would be as it was under the labour government full employment <e> <s> is that the absurdity of what ordinary people understand with this callous act of the government being nothing but a con trick <e>", "<cs> tell that to the unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that this is a vital question which has been raised by the noble earl for one particular reason <e> <s> acknowledging that the local authorities have done a magnificent job in providing homes for millions of british families that is why this is such a poignant subject when there are residences in both the public and private sectors which are left to rot for whatever reason

name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that comprehensive reply <e> <s> may i ask her whether she is aware of reports that are reaching this country of british families who are being enticed to go to the falkland islands and to have and -acre plots <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say further to the noble baroness that one particular family the dow <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the farmers and stockbreeders who it seems are infinitely more useful and important people than stockbrokers <e> <s> may i also ask the noble baroness when she makes her examination to compare what is happening now and what was envisaged in the shackleton report since there seem to be differences which ought to give us all cause for concern <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in another place the prime minister to her great credit stated quite clearly that not only was she distressed at the rise in the mortgage interest rate and showed her disapproval but also she was disappointed <e> <s> why should there be one conservative view in another place and another view here seeking to make excuses for the building societies deciding to raise interest rates and on which the prime minister said she was most disappointed <e>", "<cs> market forces <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way there is a great deal of truth in what the noble lord is saying about the mining industry but i am sure he would wish to acknowledge that if there is one industry where the law of diminishing returns applies most savagely it is coal mining <e> <s> it is brought home when you are a coal miner <e> <s> when you get out of the cage to work the second shift each day you have another yards to walk another yards to crawl to reach the surface where you

to be laid new pit props installed <e> <s> so every bit of coal must be dearer <e> <s> i know that the noble lord will appreciate that because he is a fair man <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to refer to the point that the noble lord made about people wanting to have houses but not council houses <e> <s> in the past years since disraeli really organised the first principle of council housing there was nothing whatsoever to stop the private sector from building homes if they could do so at prices which the ordinary folk could afford <e> <s> they failed on that <e> <s> that was recognised by disraeli and by subsequent governments and <e> <s> to house our people the council house was introduced because of the total complete and absolute failure of the private sector <e> <s> is that right or wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment so ably moved by my noble friend lord bruce of donington <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble earl has finished blowing his nose <e> <s> he can listen to this <e> <s> the creation of unemployment has led to an increase in the number of suicides <e> <s> economists always seem to miss out on these statistics <e> <s> the number of suicides has increased <e> <s> so has the number of divorces and the number of split families <e> <s> i believe that it is this kind of thing which can destroy our nation <e> <s> it is not

inaugurated all right <e> <s> under their stewardship we have seen the lowest production the highest imports the highest number of bankruptcies and the highest unemployment <e> <s> it is not so much a black economic death but a true blue one from which we have been suffering <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that in terms of manufactured goods an increase in manufacturing will not merely be good for the country as a whole but what is perhaps most important will make a real contribution to bringing down the scourge this country suffers from at the moment extremely high unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister inform the house what other local authorities and local government organisations that have offended the government in the governments eyes and what other local authorities and local councils who may offend central government in the future will suffer the punishment of being abolished <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to provide for the extension of travel concessions to registered unemployed persons and persons working under the youth opportunities programme <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware as he surely must he that there is genuine concern throughout all branches of local government associations as well as local councils that some of the action taken and anticipated by the government is redolent of authoritarian government rather than democratic government <e> <s> will he agree that the government should think again about some of the things that they have in mind for exercising such severe control over democratically elected bodies in british local government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble minister aware that i completely appreciate some of the submissions which he made in his replies and a great deal of those made by the noble lord lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> i first became aware of them from conservative circles in when i entered local government and i have been aware of them ever since <e> <s> would the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that those things will involve the district auditor <e> <s> we are becoming very concerned that

no to examining the problem of unemployment of millions of our fellow-britons is a little savage <e> <s> would the noble earl agree <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware of a point that i have made often in your lordships house that when this problem first arose in the early s it savagely smote the united states of america and then our country and great parts of europe <e> <s> all sorts of organisations were extant which have been quoted today the examples from the liberal benches and their contribution was nil <e> <s> it was when franklin delano roosevelt then called together <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl aware that when the president of the united states of america then called together almost the equivalent of what i am suggesting the first signs of overcoming this horrible economic disease became apparent and ultimately it was conquered <e> <s> is it not at least worth considering <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that both her replies will be widely welcomed not merely on behalf of the government and opposition parties but indeed on behalf of the british people <e> <s> such thoroughly well-founded good answers which we have heard this afternoon will be ancknowledged throughout the civilized world <e> <s> therefore by itself the answer that we have received in this chamber will contribute to britain continuing to give a lead to obtain mr mandelas release from prison or at least to ensure that he is brought to trial where the world can test for itself what if any his crimes have been <e> <s> therefore i thank the noble baroness for her replies <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate has been a very interesting one and it is a pleasure to listen to very well-informed people speaking on their specific subjects <e> <s> the only speech that flung me into the depths of the gobi desert for an absence of understanding and realism was the speech from the noble lord lord bauer <e> <s> but i will not deal with that now <e> <s> the motion of the noble lord lord seebohm was <e>", "<cs> my lords ethiopia has <e> <s> but i cannot get comfort from saying look how terrible starving mutilated and suffering from ignorance and disease this country is which is a percentage sight worse than it was when it was a former british colony <e> <s> that would be an appalling attitude barren of any understanding and if we take that view we might as well get hold of the new testament and rip out the parable of the good samaritan once and for all <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is another element that i would ask him to consider <e> <s> many of the bankruptcies that take place are quite genuine in these hard times <e> <s> people have no desire to defraud or cheat <e> <s> sometimes it happens but there is another element where firms are created to go bankrupt and they work this racket very skilfully <e> <s> they are aided lamentably i have to say by the national press and various magazines <e> <s> will the noble lord be prepared to take on board and consider this element <e>", "<cs> my lords i am following the noble lords extraordinarily interesting argument but would he tell the house who forms the imp <e> <s> who are the individuals who sit there and have this massive control <e> <s> who appoints them and who checks on them <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having my name down to participate in this short debate <e> <s> however there has been reference to me <e> <s> i was responsible in the very heat of the falklands crisis for submitting to your lordships the idea that the day would come when we have to sit down negotiate and start trading again with the argentine government and that perhaps by that time there would be a sane and sensible argentine government <e> <s> it would be a difficult situation in which we were faced with taking action in the hope that this would lead ultimately towards achieving that democratic government <e> <s> equally i was somewhat shattered when the imf made its decision to lend money to the argentine government not on the grounds that people were going to be killed that they were going to be bombed or that any welsh guards would suffer terrible things but that the international financial scene would otherwise be placed in difficulty <e> <s> the dollar the pound the franc and the mark were all put well ahead of any soldier sailor airman or anyone else <e> <s> i found this particularly repugnant <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that although the very terms local government and local authority are cold ones they make the most massive contribution to a civilised society in which great britain has given the lead <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the term local authority embraces housing health care for the aged care for the blind care for the sick and so on <e> <s> is it not disgraceful that the government should feel that it is an achievement to cut down the number of people working in these services so that they can contribute to the number unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that there is another element for which the british public appear to have shown complete contempt and that is where people enter either house under one banner and one political colour and then when they are there change that banner and that political colour because they do not have the courage to submit themselves to the electorate which sent them there in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that what is perhaps giving most people the largest amount of concern is the fact that as the noble lord <e> <s> lord cockfield stated in answers and read in the statement each time the common market reneges on an agreement we have to preface that agreement and the fact that they have not honoured it with the words it was an agreed entitlement <e> <s> it was an agreed entitlement which they have not honoured <e> <s> there is no doubt about that <e> <s> that is why as my noble friend lord bruce of donington has said i believe we must see that the noble lord <e> <s> lord cockfield <e> <s> the financial secretary and indeed the government receive full support from everyone in this chamber and i hope in the other chamber as well <e> <s> they will get the full support of the british people all right <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister not agree that the situation now in namibia is reaching horrendous proportions <e> <s> the slaying the killing the mutilating and the butchery ought to shock us all <e> <s> is he therefore able to enlarge a little upon what he meant by the co-operation of great britain in support of the united nations resolution <e> <s> what exactly is that co-operation and what is the level of support that our country is giving in this particularly awful situation <e>", "<cs> my lords up until now it has all been front bench spokesmen and i should like to put in a word for those of us who are not on any front bench <e> <s> i have never been particularly happy with the principle of statements being made either in this house or in another place when they seem to discriminate between members who are appointed to either house <e> <s> i believe that is very wrong <e> <s> the point i have in mind is that members who are on the front benches receive advance notice of what a statement is going to say <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that this could be a very useful scheme which could <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition perhaps to incentives will the noble earl the minister be prepared to take on board and consider that there are very many voluntary organisations which wish to be involved in aiding the arts but find difficulty in getting launched <e> <s> they are fairly confident that if they could get launched they could provide reasonable wherewithal for the arts in general <e> <s> will the noble earl be prepared to look at the proposition that voluntary organisations that could apply for some initial help would be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl the minister say to what use up until now the money which has accrued to the government from the sale of these british public assets has been put <e> <s> is there any truth in the rumour that some of it was used to assist in tax reductions for the better-off <e> <s> can the noble earl confirm or deny that and at the same time tell us what is to be done with the money that has accrued to the government from the sale of these public assets <e>", "<cs> my lords despite what has just been said will the noble earl the minister agree that one of the principles of british governments over very many years indeed decades has been public accountability as to what has been done with public moneys taxes or otherwise which have been gathered and how they have been distributed usually by means of the consolidated fund <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems to be a much more comprehensive report than we had anticipated <e> <s> we have an amazing number of recommendations such as for example the suggestion that the rhas should be strengthened considerably as they are responsible for running the health service in their regions and they are almost nearest to the patient <e> <s> may i ask the minister not to reply to me now but to consider with the government and put it to the government that this is a matter that we ought to debate for a few hours in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i am following with great interest what the noble lord is saying but i find in it an appalling frightening paradox <e> <s> this government were returned with an overwhelming majority <e> <s> quite a number of authorities which once were labour are now conservative to wit cardiff <e> <s> they now follow policies which were not followed before because at that time those authorities were labour controlled <e> <s> the policies which they now follow are close to those advocated by central government <e> <s> but is it an offence for a city which despite a conservative government has a socialist administration to try to adhere to what they believe to be proper socialist principles <e> <s> if it is democracy dies in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i should congratulate the noble baroness lady cox for skilfully making a contribution to an education debate when we are really discussing local government <e> <s> but i do not blame her for that because i agree with what she said about ilea <e> <s> we said it when the conservative party created it as they created the glc <e> <s> all that we are talking about tonight has been borne out because of that massive interference by people who had no idea of what local government was about masquerading as a political party known as the conservatives <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that his generous comments regarding all grades of work in the british steel industry management and workers are very much appreciated indeed <e> <s> will he please bear in mind that there is probably no other industry that requires such a vast range of skills as those that are required in the whole set-up of making steel in this country or any other country <e> <s> will he take on board the thought that we can in no way allow these magnificent skills of british workmen in the steel industry to be lost for ever <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i congratulate the noble baroness on her new government position <e> <s> i hope that she will take full advantage of it to stop some of the evils which her government propose to inflict on the british people <e> <s> is she aware that since i tabled this question there is now the proposal that the surrey cluster of hospitals the six hospitals which are the centre of research for all forms of psychiatric and mental treatment are about to be closed completely and that acres of valuable surrey land is to be sold off <e> <s> does the noble baroness not appreciate that this proposal which has already upset the whole range of psychiatric professional people from top flight consultants to nurses is causing great distress and that the government ought to have second thoughts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness for that reply and particularly that point where she said that the money will go back to the nhs <e> <s> the south thames health authority has stated categorically that when the odd psychiatric patients who have homes on the land and the few thousand nurses who have homes on it are all removed the estimate is that the value of the land will increase fifty-fold <e> <s> i understand that the government have decided to abolish the green belt restrictions to aid the authority to sell this valuable land <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister be prepared to look at any regional health authority that has designs to close mental and psychiatric hospitals which would be in total opposition to what he has just told the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the entire top consultative staff right the way through are unanimous in their view that it would be a crime to abolish the hospitals i mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that that is an absolutely appalling statement to read that this endeavour has been the endeavour of british people over the years in developing this <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the suggestion from the noble lord lord ezra is very <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an extraordinarily serious situation <e> <s> i cannot imagine anything more unbecoming when one feels deeply about people in pain people with cancer people who are suffering and people with relatives who are mental patients than that it should be met with grimaces and chuckles from some members of the conservative party <e> <s> i find that distasteful as well <e> <s> let that go on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord because what he has said i find most heartening <e> <s> i hope that it turns out to be true that the land for example of the epsom cluster despite the adverse factor of its being near to great airports and being an enticement to industrialists and others will in fact be used for the building of new and better hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just take advantage of this moment to join in the felicitations that have been given to my noble friend lord ennals <e> <s> i should particularly like to thank the noble lord lord diamond for his remarkably searching speech <e> <s> i am very glad that there is nothing wrong with his hearing or my voice <e> <s> the noble baroness lady macleod thought that i had not said very much about the future of the nhs <e> <s> that is rather like the patient complaining about the doctor who was not interested in his health but only in curing him of a very serious disease <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree when he makes recommendations to noble lords on this side of the house to cast their minds back to some aspects of nationalisation that the last time rolls-royce was nationalised it was an emergency measure of the tory government of the day <e> <s> is that not correct <e> <s> secondly is it not also true that many of our great publicly owned industries have excellent relations with sectors of private industry and that together they make very good teams in seeing that the economy of britain is well maintained <e> <s> one can hardly mention a publicly owned industry which does not have very close relations with other aspects of industry which are privately owned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the travel concessions for the unemployed bill to permit an extension to be made in assisting the unemployed when seeking gainful work be now read a second time <e> <s> it would be inconsiderate of me if i took up a great deal of your lordships time particularly as this bill was debated eight months ago and then delayed <e> <s> however i believe i have a responsibility to adumbrate some of the fundamentals in the bill and also to lament i hope on behalf of us all that unfortunately there has not been any sizeable reduction in the number of our fellow britons who are out of work since the last time i sought to have the approval of the house in moving that the bill be read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord talks about the dismal responses of the soviet union <e> <s> would he not agree that there have been endeavours as we understand from the reading of what one might describe as the more responsible press by the soviet union to try to get together to talk about these matters <e> <s> will he bear that in mind <e> <s> we cannot on the one hand as we have heard a moment ago ignore the massive advantage that the soviet union has in nuclear weapons in tanks and all types of weapons they have this massive advantage and they are being recalcitrant <e> <s> on the other hand many of us think that they want to talk about it <e> <s> if they were being really logical they would start now before the americans and the united kingdom can catch up <e> <s> so let us be sensible in trying to initiate talks with them <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me will he give me one example of where there is another source other than ratepayers and taxpayers for her majestys treasury to get its finance from <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there might be something indicative in the fact that while this house was discussing one aspect of grave concern worry and irritation to millions not tens of thousands not hundreds of thousands but millions of british families who know what it is to have to endure months and months of the breadwinner being on the dole the debate was interrupted because of our concern that we are paying much too much money to the ec and particularly to the agricultural fund <e> <s> if we could get a tenth of that back next week i am sure the government would accept this bill <e> <s> then there was that other massive great big issue of a foreign country having the right to install massive missiles which will destroy in one strike millions of human beings <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the ministers very comprehensive reply <e> <s> i am sure he will agree that it is confirmation that the government recognise the authority and knowledge of all those who are engaged in running the health service and who via their associations can respond and make recommendations to the government <e> <s> inasmuch as there might be argument as to whether or not the national health service is facing difficulties there seems to be among the staff representatives the need for a comprehensive meeting apart from the meetings which the minister has already outlined <e> <s> may i therefore ask the minister whether the government would consider that perhaps the whitley council the tuc and all the others involved should have a conference with the minister in charge to discuss the future of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords to follow up the point made by the noble lord lord winstanley there are <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i accept precisely that which the noble lord lord lyell has said that immigration is fundamentally the responsibility of the falkland islands government <e> <s> i may remind the noble lord that there have been times when we have said that the

him i speak from some experience <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down does he not think that he might have mentioned the massive anguish among small businessmen <e> <s> in the period that he talked so glowingly about there has <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the wages councils were introduced during a very painful and shameful period of our industrial history in order to prevent child exploitation <e> <s> it might well be that parts of their functions are no longer necessary and may be duplicated by bigger organisations <e> <s> will the noble earl and the department bear in mind that many small employers still find the wages councils helpful <e> <s> bearing in mind those working men and women who have no trade union to represent them if and when the wages councils are dispensed with will some guidance be given to small businessmen on how to get in touch with their chambers of commerce and their sections of the cbi and will guidance be given to the employees about contacting the trades unions that cover their industries <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister be prepared in support of lord gainfords submission of this question first of all to substitute england wales scotland and northern ireland for great britain <e> <s> secondly would he be prepared even at this early stage because these things take such a long time to discuss the issues raised by the noble lords lord graham and lord gainford with the fa <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness answer one question if not now then by either writing to me or publishing an answer in <e>", "<cs> my lords in the reciprocity agreement some illnesses are not reciprocal <e> <s> will the noble baroness take on board that the degree of reciprocity varies from country to country because it excludes certainillnesses but generally no accidents are they all included <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not be prepared to ask the forestry commission who are very knowledgable on these matters to submit reports from time to time when they feel that there is an increasing danger of acid rain on the forests of our country <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in addition to the valid and important points made a moment ago by the noble lord lord hill of luton there is also a grave anxiety arising among the poor the crippled the invalid and the elderly as to how the government are going to help them when the increases in gas and electricity take place <e> <s> can the noble lord give the house some indication of what help will be afforded to those in the categories i have mentioned when the increases take place <e>", "<cs> my lords to avoid adding to the difficulties and complexities outlined by the noble lord lord hill of luton and my noble friend behind me in so far as the gas authorities and the electricity authorities say and have told the government that they do not want to increase prices is it not obvious that the thing for the government to do is not to put up the prices and not to give people the problem of trying to work out how to get the extra couple of shillings to pay for the increases but to stop the increases <e> <s> is that not the real answer <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first congratulate the noble lord lord kaberry on his maiden speech and say how pleased i was to hear again that voice which i heard so often over very many years in another place and i am sure that he will not feel too upset at hearing my voice again <e> <s> the compliments that have been paid have been very well deserved <e>", "<cs> my lords following the point that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter made may i ask the noble lord whether if any of the big publicly-owned industries are privatised and they fall into a terrible condition and the nation is threatened as in the case of rolls-royce even a conservativegovernment as they did then will not hesitate to nationalise them <e> <s> are representatives of the consumer councils contacted when any possible price increase is envisaged on instruction by the government against the desires of those who are running the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that since the increase in private medicine this issue of transferring blood from one place to another has raised <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble minister aware that there are at this moment cases where psychiatric hospitals are trying to get rid of adjacent land which is vital to the recovery of the patients in those hospitals <e> <s> if the land goes there will be nowhere for the patients to be properly exercised so that they can be returned to the community fit and able to make a contribution to society <e> <s> is he further aware that some of the adverts concerned with getting rid of this land are almost distasteful and of a commercial character which debases the principles of our national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount not agree that despite the determined and strong endeavours of the prime minister the statement that he has had to read out is a lamentable defeat for the british government if not for the british nation <e> <s> in view of all that he said about the cap its excessive spending and other items would he not agree that it now seems that we have been debating this sort of thing for a couple of years <e> <s> then we always want to hurry to reassure those who it seems are beating us chastising us and threatening us that nevertheless we will stick with them that it does not matter how hard they hammer us <e> <s> further will the noble viscount not agree that there is now a growing number if not a majority of british people who think that this absolute adherence not to europe as mentioned by the noble lord lord diamond but to a part of europe is by itself something to which we should not every time have to bow the knee on the grounds that there is very little assurance for a flock of sheep on the way to the butcher <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that it is a speech and it is a very important one <e> <s> therefore if we are to stay in the eec it is about time that the other members tried to understand the problems being explained by our prime minister and our government as has been done in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of his speech the noble viscount lord buckmaster whom i wish to thank for introducing this vital issue as it was described by the noble baroness lady seear in her engaging speech made the point that the probability is that despite all the problems we have ethnic and religious minorities in this country are better off than their counterparts in all other countries <e> <s> if proof of <e>", "<cs> my lords if this kind of thing has to go on would the minister ask regional health authorities not to put advertisements in newspapers saying how much nicer it will be to live down there when all these mentally ill patients are moved <e> <s> this is what the south-west thames regional health authority did <e> <s> it is highly distasteful to put something like that into advertisements for the sale of land <e> <s> they can say that it is desirable land but not that it will be much better in the future because when mentally ill people are no longer there the price of property will increase which will be to everybodys benefit <e>", "<cs> certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i may <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement which the noble minister has made this afternoon must be welcome because it enables us now to examine in some detail some of the matters which were rumoured and to test which are fiction and which are fact <e> <s> for example sometimes there have been grotesque figures and sometimes there have been realistic figures of the enormous profits being made in the pharmaceutical industry <e> <s> the noble lord has to bear in mind the recommendations that were made by the highest authority of which we can conceive in this democracy a royal commission and all the facts that they took on hoard just four years ago when they made their report <e> <s> that too should be examined <e>", "<cs> but the noble lord should be aware that we must take these matters into consideration as well as the economics of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first sincerely congratulate the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil upon entering this house <e> <s> i have had the great pleasure of debating with him in another place sometimes agreeing and sometimes disagreeing <e> <s> i hope that in the not too distant future we shall be able to check up on one another by watching the way in which we deliver our speeches and listening acutely to what the other has said <e> <s> through the medium of television <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for being late to listen to everything that has already been said in this debate <e> <s> i know your lordships understand that i have participated in questions on this particular subject matter of increases in the price of gas and electricity <e> <s> in the very short contribution i wish to make i want to ask the government whether they will bear in mind and the probability is that the point has already been made that these increases in charges have not in any way been requested by the administrators in charge of these publicly owned industries <e> <s> we realise that the party opposite is almost pathologically opposed to anything that is publicly owned except the police the army the navy and the air force and to anything else which contributes fundamentally as these great industries have to the economy of great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge that the noble baroness does her homework very thoroughly indeed <e> <s> but is she aware that notwithstanding the very telling argument that she has just put forward last year british gas made a profit of million so the million it is going to give away is absolutely trivial <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl for giving way and i thank him very much <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down if he cannot give the answer tonight which i do not expect will he write to me can he confirm or deny that these increases in gas and electricity were decided on th november at a full meeting of the cabinet <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister please explain exactly what he meant when in replying to my noble friend lord jenkins of putney he referred to the safe performance of these missiles <e> <s> one understood that the object of them was to wipe out millions of human beings as quickly as possible <e> <s> secondly can the noble earl say whether the degree of safety about which he is assured includes the moving of these vehicles from place to place throughout great britain as has recently been stated in what can be described as the authoritative press <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this agreement which was hammered out by both sides of the negotiating table the staff side and the official side reflects great credit on the principle of joint negotiation and on the whitley system in particular <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that there is a sad element <e> <s> the increasing levels of redundancy in the national health service are now reflecting the same situation as in decaying industries where redundancy payments rose dramatically as their services dropped and unemployment increased <e> <s> will the noble lord take account of that as a signal to the government to look very carefully at their policies in future on the nhs <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the percentage figure which he quoted does not seem to be too high but when translated into the number of doctors nurses and midwives in the national health service it produces a figure of thousands <e> <s> would it not be possible in so far as we have this good negotiating machinery which established the levels of the redundancy pay for the same machinery to be used in seeking to bring some form of co-ordination in building the national health service rather than running it down <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the latter part of her reply will give encouragement to many people inside and outside the british commonwealth who regard the united nations as being somewhat laggardly in bringing about the independence of namibia and that the latter part of her statement is also very welcome indeed <e> <s> anyone who believes in the principle of democracy must acknowledge that the south west african peoples organisation exists that it might well win the general election in namibia and that because of that democratic element the south african government keep a stranglehold illegally on namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that notwithstanding the situation in angola unless action is taken soon by the contact five who after all are five of the most eminent members of the united nations the situation can only get worse and even more important yet more dangerous <e> <s> as we all five independently say that we adhere to the principle of the resolution and want to see it made a reality why can we not get together begin work on that task and avoid what could possibly be an extremely dangerous situation in southern africa <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl aware that all these advertisements do is confirm the ancient adage that the market place is a place that is set aside for men to cheat each other <e> <s> what we are really concerned about is how much of this cost will be taken into the calculations that might raise the price of both gas and electricity particularly for old people in the winter ahead my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble minister not agree that one cannot just shift the blame on to rhas <e> <s> what rhas have to do is carry out the policy of the government of the day <e> <s> several clauses have been implemented without any discussion whatsoever with the staff nurses doctors midwives and so on <e>", "<cs> i am coming to the question be patient <e> <s> would the noble minister not agree that it might be a good idea for everyone the rhas themselves and their staff if the staff were brought into discussions before the decision is made <e> <s> if it goes the wrong way they then have to join the unemployed <e> <s> members of our national health service are now being added to the total of the unemployed <e> <s> surely that cannot be a good thing <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the foreign secretarys statement gives encouragement and a form of hope to black people all over the world and that any statements to the contrary damage this island race of ours <e> <s> will the government maintain this policy and let the world know that we are in opposition to the degradation of people in south africa and elsewhere who happen to be born with black skins <e> <s> finally does the noble lord also agree that it is about time that namibia had its freedom from this terrorist organisation masquerading as the state of south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when he said that all points of view would he taken into consideration it was a very welcome statement indeed <e> <s> does he not agree that it is no exaggeration to say that the point raised by the noble baroness if not examined with great caution and care could well be a matter of life or death <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement repeated by the noble lord the minister called for public vigilance <e> <s> that is a very sensible and highly desirable call to make to the british public <e> <s> but i wonder whether the noble lord will look into a query that i have although i am not sure he will be able to answer my point this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble minister be at least prepared to take to the secretary of state the submission made by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> it appears to many of us who are interested in providing relief and help for the unemployed and for other people that the proposals could do two things <e> <s> first they could streamline efficiency and secondly they could increase the breadth of assistance so urgently required particularly for the unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords although i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his reply may i ask him whether he is aware that there are reports in many sectors of the british media that the government have savaged this vital principle and that the name of the master of the rolls has been involved <e> <s> is the noble and learned lord aware that this is considered to be an extremely serious situation <e> <s> is he further aware that the ripples of consternation are not limited to the field of industrial relations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor aware that i am well used to being savaged by conservative governments and that i am almost immune now to anything they can do because i have survived for so long <e> <s> the principle that i raised in my question is fundamental would the noble and learned lord not agree <e> <s> the last reply that he gave that someone did consult with the master of the rolls gives reason for apprehension but perhaps he has contributed this morning to relieving that grave apprehension that existed for which i am sure the house and indeed the country will be grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly assure the lord chancellor that when i expressed my deep appreciation of his status standing and assistance that did not mean in so far as he admitted that there had been some perhaps minor breach that this house and indeed people in this country will not nevertheless continue this issue until it is finally cleared up in the interests of our great constitution <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not follow the noble lord lord spens too much in his submission <e> <s> i have the sort of simple mind which feels that whether a big industry is publicly owned or privately owned if people do not pay their bills they have had it either way <e> <s> what is remarkable is this <e> <s> the bill is almost a condemnation of the government as being the most hopeless conservative government ever to launch out with an idea of privatisation <e> <s> we would have expected that but this is not privatisation it is more like profiteering <e> <s> the bill in no way adheres either to the philosophy of free enterprise or to that of public ownership and we all know what lies between the ideas expressed by that particular phraseology <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord tell me who did they defeat in their applications to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciate the fact that the noble lord the minister acknowledges and recognises the horrendous effects of a possible nuclear war will he be prepared to consider that in so far as it was perhaps this country great britain which had more in common with the russian people and the american people while we were all allies together just a few decades ago it could be great britain which provides the real meeting together of the soviet union our former allies and the united states our allies <e> <s> would that not serve to acknowledge that the warsaw pact and nato pact by themselves mean nothing but that it is the authority of the usa and ussr that really counts in the end <e> <s> would not some intervention and a bold independent stand by the government on <e>", "<cs> may i follow the submission made by my noble friend and the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> it does seem to me to be not merely a simple amendment which could be accepted by the government but one of very great import <e> <s> when one looks at the other countries which have this sort of thing in their legislation take for example the united states of america the federal republic of germany they would not have to argue this case it is already there built into their constitution <e> <s> sometimes we forget that there are five prime ministers in western germany because there are five states and the federal state and each state within the federal state has a prime minister <e> <s> we have not got that <e> <s> we are probably the last if not indeed the only unitary country in the world <e>", "<cs> i want to turn briefly to the submission made by the noble lord lord marsh with which i would normally wholeheartedly agree <e> <s> only some months ago in this house when we had a debate on the wording of acts of parliament to many of us on all sides of the house it seemed that some of the language used was absolutely appalling and that ordinary people could not understand it even some lawyers and judges could not understand it <e> <s> there was general agreement on that by lawyers and judges as well as by ordinary folk like myself <e> <s> therefore we must take full cognisance of what the noble lord lord marsh has said <e>", "<cs> i find these arguments somewhat distressing <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord <e> <s> lord marsh will understand when i say that when he comes here he seems on occasions to be representing a very special body in parliament not just in an organisation outside in the highest assembly in the land <e> <s> the same can be said for people who want to make representations on behalf of trade unions <e> <s> i do not think that that argument will work <e> <s> if that argument will work i do not think that the noble lord lord marsh will come here any more on behalf of one big powerful organisation <e> <s> i ask your lordships to take the attractive submission of the noble lord lord annan <e> <s> the only snag is that it has nothing to do with this bill <e> <s> there is no one like miss shirley bassey who is black welsh a good singer and cannot speak welsh who will be appointed under this bill <e>", "<cs> does the same apply in respect of nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> that is a terrible argument to make <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lord the minister to think again about what he has just said that if you do not want something in this country then you do not have to pay for it <e> <s> is it therefore the policy of the government that pacifists will not have to pay their part towards the cost of nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord prepared to look at this and perhaps come back on report <e> <s> it is a vital point <e> <s> for example there is the very telling point made by the noble lord lord marsh <e> <s> if the consumers do not like it it will go bust <e> <s> that means the consumers pay for it <e> <s> that must follow <e> <s> surely then if they pay for it they are entitled to some representation on the board <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give the house an assurance that when the amalgamation takes place there will be no diminution of staff either from charing cross or westminster or diminution of pupils when the medical schools are joined together <e> <s> can the noble lord further state quite clearly that the apprehensions which are now extant in westminster hospital about the future are unfounded <e> <s> will he take advantage of this opportunity to remove those apprehensions completely and say that westminster hospital is quite safe from any future government intervention to destroy it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister simply do nothing more than acknowledge that the staff of the westminister hospital are perturbed when they hear statements from the victoria health authority and ministerial statements which cause distress because the staff do not know which to believe <e> <s> will the minister at least say that as soon as humanly possible he will make a statement which will clear up all the doubts and let the staff of this famous hospital who have contributed so much know where they stand <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord quite rightly says that there has been much controversy over this issue <e> <s> is he not aware that the controversy has been about whether the facts he relates are really the facts <e> <s> that is what it is about <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that from time to time she herself has acknowledged the horrendous threat to mankind that nuclear weapons pose and that although step-by-step negotiation is all right it seems to the majority of people that the steps are going backwards <e> <s> we are abolishing nothing <e> <s> is she aware that the reason for that seems to be the recalcitrance of on the one hand the ussr and on the other the united states of america and with their vast experience the british government could try to bring those two together both in geneva and in the united nations so that they can start with some semblance of agreement which could lead to the steps going forwards and not backwards <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the damaging of property and causing unrest have been the excuses put forward for using retributive measures by tyrants thoughout the centuries <e> <s> would it not be much better if the type of permission acknowledged by the british people as being their right that is to say the right to demonstrate in this country at parliament at greenham at town halls and so on were given and extended in the soviet union and other fascist countries <e> <s> therefore the that might be involved is very cheap for an honourable free society <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give the house an assurance that as a result of the cuts that he has told us must be imposed there will be in no way any form of increased unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the united states of america has joined with the british government in a totally different view of why cuban troops are in angola from that offered by the noble lord lord thomas of swynnerton who made a most amazing statement <e> <s> it would have been better if he had applied it to the cia <e> <s> in so far as both america and britain now agree on an essential point would it not be a good starting point for the five nations to try to restart discussions to get namibia free of the grasp of south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that there are very many young doctors who when they finish their pre-registration course are not able to get full employment as medical practitioners because of the shortage of posts <e> <s> this is causing grave anxiety among the members of the bma and indeed among many people who are interested in the national health service having enough doctors at all times <e> <s> is the minister able to comment on that and give us an assurance that something will be done to prevent young british doctors being put on the dole by the activities of this government <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of pre-registration posts is the noble lord the minister aware that last november grave anxiety was expressed on this by the joint consultants committee and that the then chief medical officer gave an assurance that this situation would not happen again <e> <s> already this month and there are not many days in it the new chief medical officer has had to apologise and explain that nothing much has been done <e> <s> if we ultimately have a situation in which even only doctors cannot get jobs after they have qualified at a cost of million to the nation surely the government must take this very seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly in so far as the junior doctors association of the british medical association and the royal college are gravely apprehensive it might be worth while if the secretary of state indeed the noble lord the minister himself would agree to meet them to talk about their grave apprehensions on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> i am sure that she is aware that with regard to drug advertising great brtiain has by and large a very good record if not the best record in the world <e> <s> but that record is deteriorating <e> <s> of course we owe a great deal to the committee on safety in medicine but is the noble baroness aware that despite these endeavours and despite the endeavours of the industry itself there is now grave concern about the advertising of drugs <e> <s> would she not take this particularly on board as being serious that general practitioners have to carry with them magnifying glasses to read the small print of an advert <e> <s> which shows a drugs dangerous side effects <e> <s> also some of the drugs prescribed for elderly people have resulted because of gps not properly knowing the side effects in no fewer than deaths <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that despite the code of conduct of the apbi many drug companies are sometimes completely ignoring those calls and that million is spent on drug advertising of which million is allowed as an expense <e> <s> with all the points that have been raised in this chamber today would the noble baroness be prepared to speak to her right honourable friend in another place to see whether there ought to be an improvement made to the legislation to prevent the cheating and do away with the threat to people and doctors in our national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> this is one of the vital issues that the house must examine tonight <e> <s> when one thinks of security one thinks of someone giving information or succumbing to some form of blackmail by another nation <e> <s> here we have an eminent civil servant saying that a foreign government <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to be quite clear that my noble friend is saying in quoting as he did that our government succumbed to pressure from a foreign government and that therefore this is just <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened very carefully to the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> it is quite normal practice within the civil service to refer to the civil service unions for example the institute of professional civil servants and all the many organisations within the civil service which represent the people who are employed by the government at certain levels as the staff side and to refer to those employed by the government at a much higher level as the official side including all permanent secretaries and all top level civil servants of that character <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord can make that point <e> <s> i am saying that i know of and have read of no incident where civil servants have been arrested or where there has been any serious behaviour which we would deplore by a group or mass of people like those who work at gchq <e>", "<cs> well take it step by step <e> <s> we will appeal to the bishops bench first <e> <s> there is a view in this country that what the government have done has been done in a most ham-fisted way as indeed the noble lord lord rochester and other noble lords have said <e> <s> of course we would applaud any government which has had to take what might first of all appear to be an unpopular action when the safety of our nation is as stake <e> <s> but i do not believe that any minister of the crown has made such a statement <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord explain <e> <s> he has just stated that the united states government were upset over what had happened at cheltenham <e> <s> how do we know that they were upset <e> <s> who in the british government was told by the <e>", "<cs> i too wish to support this amendment for a reason that has not yet been mentioned and i should also like to support the submissions made by both the noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> it seems to me that if there is anything that the government ought to do it is to accept this amendment <e> <s> they are talking about privatisation and as i understand it there are departments of big organisations to look after specific interests <e> <s> they do not just leave it to the chairman or the managing director <e> <s> there is a plexus a hierarchy which seems to work and i assume that the government approve of that system <e> <s> that being the case then to be logical they will have to approve the amendment moved by the noble lord particularly in view of the poignant submission that has been made by both noble lords with regard to the million or million people who are hard of hearing blind or disabled <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord cockfield would be prepared to consider the arguments that have been submitted <e> <s> i did not think that his arguments were moderately put but i thought we had a faint ray of hope that the government might like to consider some aspects of the points made by the noble lord lord lloyd and later by lord ezra <e>", "<cs> fair play cuts both ways <e> <s> this debate could have been terribly acrimonious but it was not <e> <s> i have listened to it very carefully <e> <s> however one question must arise <e> <s> it is not impossible for the secretary of state to appoint a director general who after a few months or even a year in that post was found to be unsatisfactory <e> <s> i ask the noble lord lord cockfield whether the secretary of state would have the power to rid himself of the person whom he has appointed <e> <s> that question needs answering <e> <s> i am very glad that my noble friend lord bruce of donington has probed deeply with my noble friend lord stoddart into this matter <e>", "<cs> in fairness it ought to be stated quite clearly that in my own experience in another place which is not inconsiderable of dealing with both the post office and british telecom as well as with our military forces the liaison and contribution of both the post office and british telecom has been the subject of sincere and genuine praise from ministers of all governments <e> <s> indeed this is the first and only time in years that i have heard a perhaps not unpleasant but irritating remark about the people involved in british telecom such as that which i have heard tonight from the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i am sure that when the noble lord reads <e>", "<cs> as i was about to say before i was interrupted when the noble lord lord mottistone talks about the purity of the market place it might be worth his while exercising his mind to realise that of the million

jobs <e> <s> a few takeover bids and the fact that many people <e>", "<cs> noble lords may not be talking about the unemployed but i am <e> <s> many people are unemployed because of the market place

created to assist the disabled the blind and the deaf was done by ordinary people working within the post office and thinking of those things not to make a profit or to make money out of it but to contribute to the disabled <e> <s> that is the society that we believe in on this side of the committee <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord cockfield replies i wonder whether he can help us with another aspect of the submission made in the amendment <e> <s> as he has already stated it is perfectly true that the treasury will be involved <e> <s> the speech made by the noble lord lord thorneycroft gained the approval of all parts of the house and in that speech he got near to saying that the appointment of the director general of this new organisation is almost unique in history <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord glenarthur has taken it into consideration that if the words <e>", "<cs> i think that the quintessence of the argument has been submitted by my noble friend lord mcintosh but i should like the committee to examine a similar though not identical situation that existed just before the war <e> <s> it was extremely serious and it involved the supply of electricity to farmers in particular hill farmers <e> <s> for years they had asked for an electricity supply but had had to manage on their own <e> <s> suddenly as is always the case in times of great stress in particular during wartime the farmers became most important <e> <s> the then private owners of the electricity industry argued quite rightly that from a profitability point of view they could not supply farmers with electricity <e> <s> of course that could not be very well argued in wartime just as one could not allow a private soldier or a sapper to say it is not <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene for a moment <e> <s> he has just said that it is likely that the director will ensure that many parts of the british isles will not suffer <e> <s> i suggest that it is his responsibility and parliaments responsibility to see that people are in no way disadvantaged <e> <s> it surely must not be left to one man to make that decision that is why parliament exists <e>", "<cs> i believe that the government ought to accept this amendment because it is in the spirit of the entire bill <e> <s> i am sure that the government do not want any stalling or hold-up of research in the telecom industry because previous debates have outlined the remarkable new inventions and new techniques which have been developed for the disabled and others and for purposes of business efficiency <e> <s> therefore in so far as the spirit of this bill is that there shall be more private endeavour and that is what it is really all about i am sure that from a national point of view the government will want to be concerned that there is no slacking on research and development in this particular industry and that it maintains the standards that have hitherto been achieved under public ownership <e> <s> that is not only wise and necessary for those who will become shareholders but it is also wise and necessary for consumers and i believe that it is wise and necessary for the country as a whole <e> <s> in that spirit i hope that her majestys government will be prepared to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> can he indicate to us just who will be in competition with whom and in what parts of the country <e>", "<cs> i hate to interrupt the noble lord again i can see what he is driving at <e> <s> many of us have assumed that when these organisations are established under british telecom there will be certain areas of the country which for example as in regard to mercury would be their particular concern <e> <s> is it not a fact that what the government are really doing has nothing to do with competition <e> <s> they are constructing a number of privately-owned monopolies <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that when there have been previous instances of a similar character over the past years governments of both parties have always found it wise in the end to have an inquiry simply in order to clear the air and to ascertain whether a decision by a local authority is in the national interest <e> <s> all the nuances as to whether there was fair play or proper play are then cleared up which is to the benefit of all <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his reply but is he aware that there have been reports or spasmodic instances where nurses having completed their training have been unemployed for a short period <e> <s> that situation is causing some concern and does the noble lord not agree that this is a matter which the dhss should look at <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that according to the confederation of health service employees popularly known as the nurses union this temporary unemployment of state registered nurses and enrolled nurses might he spasmodic and it varies from region to region <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister would be prepared to recommend to regions where the confederation feels that there is an unnecessary hiatus created when nurses achieve their diplomas and become full-time srns and sens that they immediately enter into discussions with the confederation with a view to reducing the time during which nurses are unemployed which is a great waste for the nation and of course injurious to patients <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that the british navy is now the strongest it has ever been particularly in relation to its fire-power and many of us interpret that as its nuclear fire-power <e> <s> why then do we need a foreign nation to place its nuclear weapons on this island when the royal navy is the strongest it has ever been <e> <s> it does sound a contradiction in terms <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble baroness for raising that point <e> <s> the voluntary organisations the national organisations for the blind the purblind the deaf and the hard of hearing have all heard that argument <e> <s> they have examined it they have rejected it <e> <s> how do we know that within a year or <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful as i am sure the national associations will be for the very fulsome way in which the noble lord lord lyell has responded to my supplications <e> <s> he went into great detail which must have been the result of much research and for which we are all deeply grateful <e>", "<cs> in view of the noble lords comments there is some encouragement for the national associations <e> <s> we only want to make very certain that the government make sure that the blind are always provided with encouragement as well as practical innovation in maintaining their dignity by allowing them to earn their living <e> <s> that is not too much to ask <e> <s> i have to tell the committee that at the moment they are apprehensive as to whether or not the bill really means to do this <e> <s> it may be that the licence does <e>", "<cs> much of what i was about to say has just been said by the noble lord lord somers so i shall be brief <e> <s> i wish to answer the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and his general approach to this side of the committee <e> <s> he quite naturally and properly eulogised competition and told us all what a wonderful thing competition is <e> <s> however a few things slipped his mind <e> <s> since this government of competition came into office unemployment has become the highest it has ever been since records were kept <e> <s> bankruptcies are at the highest level since records have been kept <e> <s> in short what competition generally has produced for this nation up to now has been nothing but wretched misery for millions of our fellow-countrymen <e>", "<cs> following the noble and learned lords submissions can he explain this to me and to the committee <e> <s> it seems to me that if clause is the fundamental clause and everything laid down must be adhered to then there is a slight deviation if the word may remains because in law as i understand it above will a powerful word is shall <e> <s> therefore what the amendment submits is that there shall be total adherence to the initial clause which the noble and learned lord quoted and that there shall be no deviation <e> <s> therefore the amendment appears to assist the government in maintaining regularity in the presentation of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble earl agree <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that as he has suggested noble lords on all sides of the house are deeply concerned about unemployment among the youth and that we are not particularly upset that there may be some who are employed and are under the protection of the wages councils <e> <s> would that they were all employed and under the protection of the wages councils <e> <s> i think that every member of the house would agree with that <e> <s> is the noble earl also aware that some of the schemes on which the government have embarked are not producing results <e> <s> will he please be prepared to consider the setting up of a national council comprising representatives of the cbi the tuc and other parts of industry as well as some scientific experts and experts from our universities who might be able to make a contribution as to what is required in order to get our youth gainfully employed <e>", "<cs> is the noble and learned lord the minister aware that the view could well be taken that british legislation should by and large support anything that comes from the court of human rights in europe but that we certainly ought not to hold up any legislation to wait to see which way that court jumps <e> <s> if we start on that caper we would hardly get any legislation through this house whatsoever <e> <s> however we have to take full cognisance of what the court of human rights says <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that among both the professions in the nhs and the general public there is growing concern not so much about the people who are already in hospital but about the ever increasing waiting lists and the anxiety that that fact causes families would-be patients themselves and indeed the hospital staffs and the whole range of professions in the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his reply but is he not aware that this wilful destruction of the metropolitan county councils and their crime would appear to be similar to that of the glc that on occasions they vote labour will mean the abolition of very many services which will affect millions of ordinary people particularly the infirm and old-age pensioners <e> <s> is the minister not further aware that these six metropolitan boroughs which were created in by a conservative government and the glc now provide tremendous services and are completely in line with the redcliffe-maud royal commissions recommendations which said <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware and the house must be aware that we now face an extraordinarily serious situation <e> <s> i listened carefully to what the noble lord said in answer to my first supplementary question <e> <s> is he aware that this does not in any way link up with what mr ridley said in the other place <e> <s> he said that it might well be necessary to make changes certainly for the administrative costs in providing passes for old age pensioners <e> <s> this is not a free pass as it exists at the moment <e> <s> this house and i believe the nation want to know what are the facts of the current situation and the policy of the government <e> <s> they want to know what is said in the other place or what is said in this place <e> <s> can we have the straight direct answer to which people have a right <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that the government have to some degree moved towards meeting the criticisms of various bodies and other parties but that they are still a long way from giving complete satisfaction to the many millions who will be affected <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that when some time ago the government changed the system for assessing the rise in the cost of living the intention was that it should be to the advantage of the government but it did not turn out that way there was much concern in the city and among chambers of commerce at this particular system which was then described as being able to massage the figures to the advantage of the government and not give a true picture in the interests of businessmen who desired it <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as the minister denied what had happened would he help me in putting down an unstarred question so that we can have a thorough debate on this subject not in the interests of one party or the other but simply in the interests of honesty <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that not only i but some million of our fellow britons in all forms of organised trade union and particularly those in the civil service will welcome what he has just said and hope that this time the government will stand by their promises <e> <s> is he further aware that the incident concerning gchq which establishment we all recognise as being most vital to our defence intelligence and indeed to our allies has been brilliantly served since its inception by loyal and faithful civil servants who feel deeply aggrieved at what has happened in taking away their rights <e> <s> is he further aware that this action has been condemned by members of parliament in all parties and by all sections of the british media <e> <s> it is about time that the government realised this and should acknowledge that in so far as the trade unions have now agreed that there shall be incorporated in their relationship with gchq a firm no-strike agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords why members of the party opposite have such a hatred for free speech i cannot understand <e>", "<cs> nor why they should so stupidly exhibit it whenever they have an opportunity <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble earl the minister for his reply <e> <s> is he aware that if he can persuade his colleagues to accept the no-strike agreement and withdraw what has been done it will be to everyones advantage in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl the minister aware that in the past years of conservative government since the war we have had five conservative prime ministers and eight conservative foreign secretaries none of whom found it in any way necessary to indulge in the action of the present government <e> <s> is he further aware that the select committee was also opposed to this activity <e> <s> therefore would he be prepared to recommend that the whole thing should now be referred to the security commission <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount say something about this matter being referred to the security commission so that these people are not left isolated by a specific piece of government activity of which they are really frightened <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord the minister for that admission <e> <s> of course the government have no evidence because they do not collect the figures <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the british medical association feels very strongly on this subject since doctors are no longer allowed to register as being unemployed as doctors and wishes to know the numbers so that it may gauge the problem and be able to help its members and also the national health service <e> <s> therefore is the noble lord not prepared to consider the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the bma feels strongly about this matter simply because it wishes to gauge the extent of unemployment among doctors <e> <s> as the noble lord has said it is probably true that the majority of those involved are junior doctors but it does not mean to say that because they are junior doctors it does not matter <e> <s> in fact i am reliably informed that the problem of unemployment goes right the way up and even some consultants are unemployed <e> <s> should there not be sensible co-operation between either the bma and the dhss or the bma and the department of employment <e> <s> the sole purpose of asking this question is in the hope of getting sensible co-operation between the government and the bma <e>", "<cs> my lords i must press the point <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that we are not asking for something new but simply on behalf of the bma that the practice which existed for many years and which was very useful should now be reinstated in the interests of the government of doctors and generally of our national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that the government must now take full cognisance of the speeches made by the noble lords lord donaldson and lord peyton which supported absolutely the superb submission made by my noble friend lord stoddart of swindon <e> <s> in a way they must totally reject the argument submitted by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> even if what he said is correct that at this <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble earl agree that bearing in mind that the industry is making a large profit this unnecessary increase will bring about a needless twist to the prices spiral on the one hand and on the other hand will make life much more difficult for the poorer of our citizens in particular the disabled <e> <s> does he not also agree that the whole affair is completely out of balance and is damaging to both industry and the moral structure of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister says that the deal is confidential does he mean the details of what has been entered into or the details of the people with whom the government have done business <e> <s> for example can he tell us with whom the government have been deliberating on these elements which he calls confidential <e>", "<cs> my lords may i please ask the noble earl whether he would be prepared to consider the view of very well-known geologists and mining engineers that a pit which today might well be uneconomic to run can be closed without necessarily being dispensed with for ever <e> <s> it can so to speak be mothballed bearing in mind that peradventure its contents may be required in years to come <e> <s> ought that point not to be seriously considered by the government with regard to industrial energy processes <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say that if as the gas corporation indicates the levy from north sea gas amounts to around million this will be judciously used or even stored ready for the day when we have to pay for gas from elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the noble lord <e> <s> lord boyd-carpenter made no complaint about those people on the march <e> <s> he even described the demonstration as being small and pathetic <e> <s> the complaint that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter made was about the police closing roads which there was no need to have closed and i am sure that the house should like to have an answer as to why that was done <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way perhaps i may correct him i am sure that he would not want to mislead the house <e> <s> what he has just said has not been uttered by any outstanding and leading member of the labour party <e> <s> we believe that if the community is to be all that

noble lord lord obrien of lothbury and the members of his committee on producing this extraordinarily valuable report which by and large i support <e> <s> what i found particularly good about the report was that it compelled one to think and go beyond the terms of reference to which the committee had to adhere <e> <s> i believe that that is the acid test of a good report and it did that <e>

read it and understood it one is compelled to agree with the conclusion that the eec is in a mess <e> <s> that is where we have to start our thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord help us <e> <s> if some documents have been returned and are finished with and others are not yet ready to be returned can he define which have been returned or those which have not been returned <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that very many financial experts who write articles for various newspapers which might he described as substantial newpapers would entirely disagree with the remarks made by the noble lord lord thorneycroft <e> <s> therefore is it not a fact or are those experts telling lies when they write that after this budget the poorer people in our land will be poorer than they were in because of the increased amount of taxation that they have to carry <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that no responsible minister such as himself or indeed anyone interested in whether these measures will affect the poorer in our community can look at the issues without <e> <s> for example noting the following <e> <s> those who are sick ill and disabled will have to pay increased prescription charges also there is a possibility that million people mostly old people will have to buy spectacles without aid from the dhss and most responsible economists have declared that those at the lower end of the income scale of our nation will be worse off under this budget <e> <s> therefore all this means that the poor will become poorer while the rich become richer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add just a few points to the superb submission made by my noble friend lord bruce of donington <e> <s> as he has said the essence of our amendment is in no way to seek a privilege but to make good a legal anomaly that was never really intended <e> <s> i shall say a few words about that later <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest of respect there seems

an interim statement which would have been acceptable to the profession instead of treating it in the offhand manner in which he has treated this question this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister not agree that this distressing question of excessive overtime on the one hand and threatened unemployment on the other that affects junior doctors is also now applicable to

he a gross distortion of the facts to <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the problem arises from the distribution of consultants <e> <s> there might be a number of specialists in one area and only half that number in another area so that inevitably as the minister has already said the waiting periods will vary <e> <s> the remarkable thing is that this tremendous and wonderful work is being done <e>", "<cs> therefore my lords would the minister not agree that if this situation could be examined the tremendously good work now being carried out could be enhanced by a better

mentally and physically handicapped <e> <s> in view of the existence of the remarkable teaching staff who are trained to help such afflicted children will the minister ensure that they are in some way

developments in world politics the noble lord lord chalfont has been for years particularly on this subject absolutely consistent <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am very pleased to hear that the government are willing to search hard for a solution to this problem <e> <s> but is he also aware that a summit conference on this <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that as the noble lord lord renton has said conventional arms must equally come under some kind of control <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe sometimes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister acknowledges and is aware of the importance of this subject and recognises that it demands reasonable examination <e> <s>

way <e> <s> is he really trying to convince us that the policies which produced three-quarters of a million to one million unemployed are not as good as the policies which are producing between million and million unemployed <e> <s> in other words why is he in favour of massive unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is not possible to accede to this request for the location of this centre in the city of westminster is there any other great seaport city which would be prepared to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl the minister aware that in the united states the authorities introduced computers to children when they were at an extraordinarily early age <e> <s> that was an experiment involving very young children and those children have taken to computers remarkably well <e> <s> is that the situation in great britain <e> <s> if not is this not a point which our own department of education might examine <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a long debate <e>

there is a match to win and there certainly is <e> <s> the match that we have to win is to try to get this government to listen to others than their own specific rich friends <e> <s> if we can have done that in this house tonight i believe we shall have made a good contribution to overcoming some of the ills that afflict us <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble minister say whether the government are paying attention to submissions made in this house on many occasions to the effect that the monies being spent on the trident system would be much better used on conventional systems for the defence of this nation <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect will the noble lord answer the important part of my question <e> <s> as i am sure he is aware it refers to very important submissions made by distinguished service officers who are now in this house <e> <s> are the government at least paying attention to their submissions that the money spent on the trident system might be better spent on conventional weapon systems <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble baroness be prepared to accept that the issue of sovereignty ought not to stop negotiations continuing particularly in the field of commerce and trade <e> <s> when these matters really get under way they could perhaps make a contribution to a much better attitude and spirit which will resolve the other issue which is now blocking things altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the cause of all the serious problems in south america which are dangerous to nato and the west in general is the simple lack of social justice which has been expounded by the pope in the past hours <e> <s> is she aware that the attitude of the british prime minister who is prepared to see the vice-president of nicaragua is a very welcome and healthy change which contrasts severely with the reagan administrations point of view and that this could be a hopeful step in the right direction of bringing first peace and then some form of ever-increasing social justice in south america <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness will view with some sympathy the question which i put because it is not terribly difficult and ought to be easily understood <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that the initiative which has been taken by the british prime minister is something new <e> <s> it is far better than the way in which the american administration have been behaving with their evil cia which has been condemned on both sides of this house <e> <s> therefore would not the noble baroness be prepared at least to pursue the initiative which has been taken by the prime minister which might encourage the americans to come together so that we could all talk about this matter and try to resolve the problem <e> <s> moreover that would remove another threat to possible world war <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister stated that we might take some guidance from what happened at hiroshima but i should like to ask him whether he is aware that in the view of renowned american and british scientists to do such a thing would be foolhardy <e> <s> the massive power of thermonuclear bombing now makes hiroshima seem in the words of one eminent scientist like a squib <e> <s> therefore is it not dangerous for us to think that in the peradventure of there being a thermonuclear war we might gain from the fact that some people escaped at hiroshima <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for that explanatory answer <e> <s> however is she aware that while all that she has said is very commendable there is a general feeling that all questions of disarmament are for russians and americans only <e> <s> would she not agree that there ought to be a specific lead given by the eec in which britain could play a great role to remind both americans and russians that we too are interested in disarmament and who knows <e> <s> might be able to make very useful suggestions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that much of what she has referred to has now alas <e> <s> become run-of-the-mill meetings which do not have any visible or real effect on the arguments of disarmament <e> <s> in so far as this is a sensitive question one has to be careful about how one words questions no one wishes to embarrass the government <e> <s> i have always included the phrase if they would consider <e> <s> all i want is europe to give a lead and to have the same important standing as america and russia perhaps our country and our government should give the lead by establishing a specific conference which would have the attention of and be listened to by the whole of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that it is not inconceivable to assume that many students belong to political parties other than the conservative party <e> <s> before anything is done ought not the views of those and the percentage who do not belong to any political party be heard as well as tory party views before the conservative government indulge in any action on behalf of one political section of the national union of students <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>",

spain which would cause difficulties for the gibraltarians <e> <s> in that event should that transpire may we have an assurance that britain will immediately give every assistance to the government and the people of gibraltar <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the insouciant attitude of the free world to the namibian situation reflects no credit on us on the rest of the free world and certainly not on the united states of america <e> <s> is she further aware that this change of heart by the united states of america is welcomed and could lead to a solution <e> <s> can she say what is the practical in her words weight and help that this government are prepared to give the united nations to free namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be prepared to consider that it might very well be worthwhile producing some form of informative document showing how british businessmen industrialists and those in commerce might be able to contact our high commissioners directly and indeed for that matter our ambassadors overseas and where they could receive the sort of guidance and help for which the noble lord lord moran asked in his supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord the minister for that not surprising answer <e> <s> is he aware that if there had been a specialist committee it would probably have revealed as people in all parties now agree that the trident programme could be the most appalling waste of public money in this century that it would cause a grave hindrance to the development of british conventional forces and that it could in the end prove to be a dent in the nato defence <e> <s> will he therefore consider his answer and go back to the secretary of state and ask whether this should at least be looked at <e>", "<cs> but my lords is the noble lord not aware that over the past four years the cost of trident has almost doubled and that we are very far away from the peak period <e> <s> is he further aware that the moscow criterion as that yardstick is so called is now completely ruled out by everybody who has a great interest and knowledge in the defence of this nation because polaris will do exactly the same thing <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that there are two real dangers in continuing this programme <e> <s> that is why a committee should be set up to examine it it could damage the british economy and it could dent the nato shield <e> <s> is that not a serious situation <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a very interesting debate and as the noble lord lord colwyn has said many of the people who have participated in this debate also participated in the debate which i initiated some time ago <e> <s> the remarkable fact is that we have become more depressed <e> <s> what the noble lord lord colwyn failed to notice is that things have got worse <e> <s> he himself

to call their mind <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that the position seems to be that this missile cannot be fired without the authority of the prime minister <e> <s> in regard to a recent occasion when it seemed that the prime minister might be involved she said that she was on holiday <e> <s> what will happen then if a serious situation arises <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that the basis of this dispute seems to be different interpretations of a national plan for coal which was agreed by both sides and then there came disagreement <e> <s> it was obvious that that disagreement was going to be serious <e> <s> was it not then the responsibility of the government to appoint somebody to bring both sides together to see whether they could be reconciled over what was causing the disturbance <e> <s> the government should not have remained completely outside the pale but should have had the courage to exercise their rights as the government of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the government could at least try <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the point raised by the noble lord lord kilmarnock is giving grave concern to

indicated by my noble friend lord bruce of donington i believe that this bill has the wrong title <e> <s> it is not a shipbuilding bill at all it is a bill to prepare for the selling off to private folk of the british publics assets in shipbuilding rather than that they should be owned by the nation <e> <s> in consequence the minister painted the governments usual plastic rosy picture of how they will throw to the workers the redundancy lifebelt of cast-iron or both ends of the lifeline at the same time <e> <s> what they are really doing is wrecking the old red duster which has served this nation so very well for almost years in war-time and in peace-time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords the idea of this bill is to privatise the shipbuilding industry and then it will be purchased by certain people thinking that they will make a lot of money out of it <e> <s> but if the minister keeps up his argument now the government will be lucky if they can give it away <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> would not she agree that the agreement is a remarkable achievement and that great credit is due to the british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe and to sr moran of democratic spain <e> <s> in so far as regular meetings are to be held would not the noble baroness agree that it would be worthwhile that those meetings should be followed up in every possible way to nurture cultural and economic development between spain and

referring to shipbuilding and ship-repairing which comprise one of the backbone industries of gibraltar <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that in addition to the environmental damage we are in the terrible dilemma of knowing full well that the carriage of materials by heavy freight lorries is essential to the economy but at the same time it causes grave social nuisance to very many people <e> <s> successive governments have looked at what can be done to our existing canal waterways <e> <s> therefore should it not be a matter of top priority to carry out a thorough investigation so that we can make full use of our canals <e> <s> as the noble lord lord gainford has said there are more canals in london than there are in vienna <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have said venice <e>

out and i am referring now to the social damage and the environmental damage and make at the same time a magnificent contribution to our economy and full use of reorganised canal systems <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that comprehensive reply is most appreciated <e> <s> i acknowledge that to a degree both the united nations and the eec have endeavoured to follow the british lead <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that the british foreign secretary has given a magnificent lead in all matters involving the middle east and particularly in this dreadful conflict <e> <s> he has pointed out the dangers which can afflict the rest of mankind <e> <s> in so far as he has given the lead and in so far as britain has supported both the eec and the united nations in its formative ideas is it not now about time that these two organisations followed up the submissions of the british foreign secretary which have been both realistic and imaginative <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister agree that the british government realises the enormous amount of trade and commerce which goes on in the gulf between our country and the gulf states and that if it were shattered it could cause an increase of almost another per cent <e> <s> in british unemployment <e> <s> at the same time the government have not ignored the human horror and tragedy of the war <e> <s> finally will the noble lord confirm that the british foreign secretarys proposals for cutting out some of the horrendous actions such as the bombing of cities have been accepted by iraq but not by iran and that this is the lead that the british are giving a lead which i hope the noble lord will urge the eec the americans and the united nations to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that all these step-by-step discussions over the past years have resulted in one thing an ever-increasing number of nuclear weapons that can now wipe out all mankind <e> <s> is he not further aware that people of all political persuasions with a deep interest in this subject think it is about time that great britain and her european colleagues should tell the americans just as they should tell the russians that we can no longer stand by and watch the scene being dominated by the united states and the soviet union and that the voice of britain and her european colleagues should also be heard so as at least to stop the present accumulation of nuclear arms and sincerely work out a method whereby they can be reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give an assurance that when area health authorities announce the impending closure of psychiatric hospitals and the views of the authority are not clear and representations are made by the british medical association and the confederation of health service employees their views are taken into consideration <e> <s> if that is not done now can they be taken into consideration in future <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that one of the important aspects of the entire nationalisation act did not rest merely with the making or the saving of

on the statement made by his right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble baroness for that reply is she not aware that some extreme right-wing countries and extreme right-wing guerrilla organisations have been guilty of the most appalling atrocities wrought upon ordinary people with arms supplied by the american government <e> <s> is she aware that one classic example is guatemala where after the butchering of tens of thousands of indians with arms supplied by the united states aid was stopped by president carter but has now been restarted by the present administration <e> <s> in so far as this constitutes a very serious threat to belize which must involve the british government should we not continue protestations about this awful behaviour of the american cia which is damaging their country and many other free nations as well <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness not agree that my original question simply asked our government to consider making representations on the evidence that is available to them <e> <s> only a few weeks ago for example the united states arms control and foreign policy caucus in congress condemned united states policy and said that those responsible in that sphere were misleading the united states congress as well as the united states people <e> <s> should we not give them our support by making representations <e> <s> or can the government at least consider making representations to the united states on the basis of these reports <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness on what she says about guatemala <e> <s> she is absolutely correct <e> <s> what the american foreign affairs committee complained of was the behaviour of the american cia under someones command in el salvador <e> <s> does she not think it is worth making representations about that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that there are in this country quite a number of informed people who believe that in the event of a thermo-nuclear war there really is no defence <e> <s> will he also agree that perhaps one of the best contributions put forward as to how to tackle this problem was submitted by the late sir winston churchill when he advised very strongly that it would be quite unwise to have another nations dangerous weapons stationed on this island <e> <s> that could make some contribution not merely to civil defence but also the defence of the entire nation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that we hope that in the event of a thermonuclear war not only my noble friend lord jenkins of putney but also the noble baroness will survive <e> <s> is she also aware that they would probably suffer more than the odd million human beings on this island who would be destroyed <e> <s> the experts tell us that those who survive are likely to be those who suffer most <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the men and women and specialists who work in the heart surgery unit are of the ppinion that were it not for the donated by this benefactor the unit would have been closed <e> <s> is he further aware that there are threats still extant in regard to premature babies with heart trouble requiring heart surgery and also in regard to dialysis patients <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that the surgeons at guys and their predecessors have done magnificent work in the past

also considering for financial reasons the elimination of pacemakers <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the principle of these visits can only do good in numerous ways <e> <s> we should not only congratulate the noble lord but indeed thank him as well <e> <s> would he also consider that in future there might be other visits not purely based on the type of delegation which he led but visits that could involve cultural activities and exchanges between the two countries <e> <s> when we do have visits similar to the one he has so ably led could the base be just a little broader so as to involve all people in our country who contribute to the success of our nation and not merely the so-called leaders right at the top <e> <s> that is a broad pyramid we can all be proud of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord the minister for his reply may i ask him whether he can confirm that the ministry of defence officials at luxembourg today have been reported as having already agreed to indulge in research if their advice is requested <e> <s> would this not seem to be in keeping with the enthusiastic support which the prime minister gave to president reagan when she was recently in the united states but totally at variance with the views of the british foreign secretary <e> <s> can the noble lord indicate to us which is the correct course that of the ministry of defence the foreign office or the prime ministers office <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> there have been fewer speakers on this side and <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reply to one point made by the noble lord lord reay <e> <s> he said that robot control of nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble minister not agree that this last white paper as the noble lord lord mccarthy has said is an improvement on the previous white papers but the grim truth is that white papers over the past couple of years and all the legislation that has flowed from them has not to any great degree made any massive improvement in the situation <e> <s> young students with massive ability on leaving our universities and technical colleges are on the dole and unemployed because there is no particular industry that can take advantage of the qualities that they have obtained in technical colleges on training schemes and in universities <e> <s> therefore would he not agree that all of this will be absolutely useless unless we really consider what has to be done in this extraordinarily difficult task <e> <s> i immediately concede that it is an enormously difficult task but it will have to be done to make these white papers worthwhile <e> <s> the task involves setting about the entire reconstruction of the united kingdoms industrial base so as to take advantage of the training that the white paper indicates will be available for young people <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with others who quite rightly have already paid compliments to my noble friend lord murray of epping forest for his considerable and if i may say so learned maiden speech to your lordships house this afternoon <e> <s> i should also like to say and i think that it has to be said that what i find remarkable about this debate is that we have had similar debates to this one over the past four years in this chamber <e> <s> we have had similar speeches and they all have said in much the way in which the noble lord lord bauer ended his speech that they are sure that what the government have now proposed is going to ease the situation in unemployment while the truth is that every time we have a debate like this emanating from some government statement or budget with all the same speeches applauding it up goes the level of unemployment <e> <s> let us hope that it does not happen this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> in regard to summit conferences on thermonuclear weapons and there are now enough of them to wipe out all

could entrust itself to the european partners to concentrate on finding some form of verification acceptable to east and west that may be the great breakthrough <e> <s> may i also ask the minister whether he can say what progress has been made in multilateral talks to prevent the arms race in space <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble lord the minister that his reply in regard to the arms race in space is very encouraging <e> <s> i feel certain that our government have played an important part on which they ought to be congratulated <e> <s> would the minister be prepared perhaps to discuss with even the foreign secretary whether the european members of nato with the brains that they have at their disposal could examine the possibility of finding some form of verification <e>

contributed to a particular political party why should it be different for trade unions <e> <s> why cannot they do precisely the same <e> <s> secondly to follow the logic of the original question ought it not be proper for all the other political parties that receive money from outside sources to do what the labour party does and publish where every hapenny comes from in their annual report

multi-millions of the taxpayers money <e> <s> some of us are really concerned that the noble earl lord gowrie is so very complacent about that and that when someone feels a little upset about it he borders on terms of being offensive when he describes my noble friend lord bruce as being hysterical <e> <s> if i may say so i think my noble friend is very well-armed with facts figures and experience in the european parliament and indeed with regard to the eec <e> <s> so i wonder whether the noble earl who is a fair-minded man will take back to the leader of the house the feeling that on a subject of this importance we ought to have the sort of debate that he himself seemed to indicate we ought to have <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> does she not agree that the answer itself indicates that very little progress has been made <e> <s> i believe that the new rulers of argentina who were opposed to the attack on the falkland islands want to have a solid relationship with us <e> <s> it might be well worth our while appointing a commission perhaps under the lord privy seal to go to the argentine to sort out the real problems there and overcome them in the interests of both countries <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that while the argument she submits apropos sovereignty of the falklands is a very real one that should be no reason or obstacle in the way of seeking to establish the kind of relationship for which i asked in

system to verify disarmament that would be much to be preferred for the security of mankind to any system of star wars <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that while the major nations involved with the united nations plan have been somewhat dilatory in implementing what is required nevertheless what he stated here this morning will be welcomed by all sane and civilised people as standing by

declare today that every endeavour will be undertaken to see that these infringements will not occur again <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that the matter has not been handled properly <e> <s> on the one hand there is this enormous salary paid to the individual involved and on the other hand an enormous increase in unemployment with nurses doctors junior doctors and other

been the disgruntlement that now exists not only in the civil service but in other great departments of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he has given in part a very happy reply to my question <e> <s> however bearing in mind that this is a momentous week which acknowledges the mighty achievements of the americans the british and the russian people would it not be a rather remarkable and perhaps superb idea for our present government despite the fact that they are a bit

approach and an entirely new aspect of international life between the three great nations that did so much to save mankind years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the russian

defeated <e> <s> and where was he heavily defeated <e>", "<cs> my lords he was defeated only in the selection <e> <s> he never stood to be president <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is as usual totally wrong <e> <s> he was defeated in his selection but not defeated in any public election <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter does not seem to understand that you cannot even become a candidate in the united states of america without winning so many primaries <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble lord knows so very little about the great ally that he loves <e>", "<cs> my lords what are they waiting for then <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord chalfont for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> he has given the house some vital information <e> <s> where is the leak in russia from which all that information has come <e> <s> the russians do not appear to be very good at concealing such information if it can be revealed so easily <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that very full reply <e> <s> however does he not agree that to make it a reality there will need to be a strengthening of the anti-ballistic missiles treaty that some of the questionable soviet activities will have to be stopped and that some of the novel interpretations of that treaty emanating from washington must cease <e> <s> if those matters could be achieved they could make a reality of salt i and then perhaps lead to an approval of salt ii <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the noble lord the minister agree that while it is certainly within the capability of the soviet union and the united states of america completely to wipe out all mankind it is therefore incumbent upon any government to try to initiate a reduction of these terrific weapons <e> <s> could it not be britains role particularly with geneva in the offing to eliminate suspicion and mistrust among the super powers and perhaps help to create a climate of realism within geneva so that what is being proposed what is being debated could ultimately lead to a commencement of the reduction of these horrendous weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be good enough to look into one specific case that is causing grave concern which is the threat now being made to london bus drivers that they could possibly have a reduction in their earnings of between and a week <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness be prepared to consider the possibility of establishing an international consultative examining committee drawn from all nations of top-flight scientists who are acquainted with this problem both for examining proposals for disarmament and then for following them up with positive verification <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister say who will be the judges of whether these young people suffer a per cent <e> <s> loss of benefits <e> <s> before what court or its equivalent will these young people who are so accused appear <e> <s> further will they be allowed to be defended as well as prosecuted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that the secretary of state for the environment has responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that what gives concern to people not only in london liverpool and birmingham but throughout the country is that whereas they may read in the newspapers one day that mr kenneth baker will be tackling this serious problem of lawlessness and its root contributory factors which we all know exist they then learn that his endeavours may never reach reality because the financial support required is not to be forthcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords it was the noble lords opposite who initiated the proposal for more spending <e> <s> the statement i repeated was made by the secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> noble lords opposite are supporting him but the minister is not supporting him <e> <s> it was mr kenneth bakers idea and his idea alone <e> <s> he asked for the money <e> <s> we support him in his endeavours <e> <s> it is a pity that the front bench opposite does not support him as well <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what is being done to combat and apprehend the purveyors of these drugs to young children and the vicious chains that stretch from airports and ports <e> <s> that is where these drugs emanate and from where they spread to all the community including the children we are talking about this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have this question this afternoon does the minister agree that these drugs are reaching british children <e> <s> therefore is it not significant and a fact that the preventive measures are insufficient <e> <s> will he please answer the question <e> <s> what ought to be done what might be done and will there be an improvement in the future in preventing these drugs from reaching british classrooms <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> does he not agree that the aid must match the need <e> <s> would it not be a good thing in addition for both private and public enterprises to be encouraged to give what help they can so that the dreadful period of unemployment we have seen recently will slowly abate <e>", "<cs> my lords in acknowledging that this is a complex problem perhaps i may ask whether it is not a fact despite the generous increase in urban aid during the past months that over the past three years when this problem first started that aid still constitutes a per cent <e> <s> reduction <e> <s> in order to see that money is properly used would it be possible for the government to consider the establishment of an economic co-ordinating team to ensure that the right aid goes to the right place at the right time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say a brief word on whether it is possible to have some form of co-ordination on this difficult problem so that as i have already said we have the right aid at the right place at the right time <e> <s> in my view we should have a sensible co-ordinating committee or examining committee to see that that is achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister if he will also take note of what the noble lord lord hunt said <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the organisations named in the question are not merely anti-competitive but were primarily designed to prevent cheating accidental or otherwise and they also have the responsibility to curb what has been described by an eminent ex-prime minister as the other ugly side of the face of capitalism <e> <s> as the noble lord lord campbell said it would appear that they rarely defend individuals and so do we not require something like the consumer councils of the publicly <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister when the review takes place look at the rights of individuals as well as associations to lodge complaints <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister acknowledge the obligation that exists to the veterans and to <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the provision of all forms of swimming facilities is the responsibility of the local authority and acknowledging that there is a grave paucity of olympic-size swimming pools throughout the united kingdom will the minister be prepared to accept a proposition from those local authorities which believe that they can make a contribution towards remedying a serious situation and have a few more olympic-size swimming pools built in great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in russia in some continental countries and in the united states they start to train their olympic stars while they are at school <e> <s> that is why they do so well <e> <s> will the noble lord make a big endeavour at least to catch up <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that that is a most encouraging reply <e> <s> i am deeply grateful for it and i think all people with interests in the middle east and the re-establishment of peace there will also welcome it <e> <s> may i ask the noble baroness whether she is further aware that in many parts of the middle east and in the gulf states there is still great regard honour and respect for the united kingdom from our ante- and post-colonial period and that this country is held in much higher respect than either of the so-called super powers <e> <s> is she aware that therefore we have a special role <e> <s> i am very pleased the initiative has been taken as i believe that it is this nation that can establish peace in the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that there is no other organisation and that like every other extremist organisation it is born out of frustration <e> <s> is she further aware that when one travels through the gulf and the middle east one finds there is much respect for this country and acknowledgement for the point of view that we have taken <e> <s> i hope that we shall in no way be sycophantic to some elements of the united states administration which have looked at this whole question in such a biased manner <e> <s> like many others who have knowledge of the middle east i happen to believe that great britain can make a big contribution to securing peace in the middle east as i hope the noble baroness will appreciate and understand <e>", "<cs> my lords under the terms of the memorandum have we not been led to believe and understand that it is the desire of president reagan that there should be almost total participation including the warsaw countries as well as nato so that the whole idea is ultimately to provide for the entire world a kind of safe cover <e> <s> how can this be done if some parts of either the warsaw pact or nato are going to demand to have a little secret investigation on their own <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that no one would dispute the figures he has given but this is a very special problem which faces the royal british legion <e> <s> many of us think that the state should have accepted this responsibility because were it not for the royal british legion literally hundreds of thousands of disabled british ex-servicemen would have practically nowhere to go <e> <s> there is an additional problem <e> <s> they were disabled as young men and as they grow older like most of us now many are aged between and they face additional problems because they are limbless or severely disabled <e> <s> may i put this plea to the minister very simply <e> <s> would he be gracious enough to see the specialist committee of the royal british legion which is itself voluntary and knows all about this problem <e> <s> its members have devoted their lives to it <e> <s> would he ask his honourable <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding the fact that there has been some association between westland and sikorsky previously is it not a fact beyond all dispute that westlands best customer is the ministry of defence and that therefore the general public as well as parliamentarians in both houses have a right to know precisely what is going on <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is so and if at the end of the day the decision has been made by some private organisation what was the cabinet meeting about <e> <s> why do we have a cabinet <e> <s> or is it a complete waste of time <e> <s> this is a pretty poverty stricken cabinet i admit nevertheless they have a right to say on behalf of the british people what is to happen to a firm of which the british people are its best customers and to say whether we are to support europe or the americanisation of this firm <e> <s> therefore this must be a cabinet decision on behalf of the people <e> <s> we may not agree with it but the cabinet has a right to make it <e> <s> if we are to say oh no it is a matter for the private entrepreneurs then why bother with this procedure at all <e> <s> why should it have gone to the cabinet <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the noble baroness on maintaining that old conservative philosophy of not having the courage to look at the new moon out of respect for the old <e> <s> is she aware that the question simply asks if the case could be considered <e> <s> if that cannot be considered there is nothing in the whole field of trying to obtain peace let alone goodwill in the whole edifice of the structures of western and eastern politics <e> <s> what is sincerely being asked is for our country to give a lead in trying to find the ways and means <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware on reflection that all that is being asked is to try to establish some ways and means of taking the bitterness out of the cold war so that perhaps great britain can provide an initiative in finding a way to peace <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that some of her replies appear to be at variance with sir geoffrey howes observations at the nato foreign secretaries conference where he and herr genscher expressed grave apprehensions <e> <s> herr genscher said that the policy of sdi would give super protection to the super powers but would leave the lesser powers in danger <e> <s> he was supported in that view by britains foreign secretary who asserted that we have to find ways and means of talking with the ussr in order to secure peace <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that the canadians too and the canadians are important feel that the present attitude will endanger norad <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness be prepared to examine the anxiety that exists both within the british medical association and the confederation of health service employees <e> <s> since the introduction of managers who have concentrated on reducing costs there seems to have been along with that policy a demonstrable and disturbing drop in morale among nursing staff <e> <s> what i am saying is supported by the british medical association and the confederation of health service employees who represent nurses and junior doctors <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness take into her confidence at the ministry both the representatives of the bma and the confederation of health service employees <e> <s> if she does so i believe that what she and i wish to attain can be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that a recent statistical survey in the london borough of ealing revealed that about people a year need not have died if they had not been heavy cigarette smokers <e> <s> when one multiplies that figure to cover the united kingdom is not smoking seen to be in every sense a deadly habit <e> <s> would it not be criminal to allow the deadly weed to be obtained anywhere on the cheap <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord explain the statement that he made a moment ago about actual cash and borrowing <e> <s> he gave the example of a council tenant being allowed to purchase his house <e> <s> let us assume that he goes to a building society as the overwhelming majority have to do to raise a mortgage <e> <s> is nothing at all sent to the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware of the grave consternation expressed in british newspapers and in newspapers of the united states of america about the behavour of the cia which is an official part of american policy in nicaragua and other parts of southern america which is also a form of terrorism <e> <s> should we not make representations about that as well as making representations about what has been happening to our people in this country as a result of ira activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that verification always has been a difficult stumbling block <e> <s> however there has now been a positive contribution from mr gorbachev that he recognises the problems of verification and he is asking for full consultation and examination of the proposals that he has adumbrated which are lengthy and complicated but which he believes will satisfy all the major powers involved with any form of nuclear weapons testing them or even developing them in future <e> <s> therefore ought not the government to take notice of this and perhaps ask the united states to call a conference with the soviet union on this whole subject of verification and testing <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not agree that she was quite correct when she said that there are local functions and authorities who endeavour to help their local aspect of the national health service <e> <s> does she agree that britains national health service is probably the most civilised piece of legislation placed on the statute book of this country or of any other and that we should not dream of debasing it in any way any more than we should try to maintain the royal air force the royal navy or the british army by forms of voluntary subscription such as that indicated in the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> does she not agree that despite the reply she has given in reality very little has been achieved <e> <s> is she aware that recently there have been words of encouragement from the israeli prime minister mr shimon peres when he indicated that resolution could be a basis in regard particularly to the occupied territories and that in return mr arafat has said that such an attitude would help him to advise that full recognition of israel should be made <e> <s> my final point is this <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that of the western powers britain is probably thought of more highly in the middle east than any other and that we have a very useful role to play so as to take full advantage of both those statements <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> is it not therefore logical to seat all these people on one side to talk about the developments and that there should now be some indication made to arab representatives for them to have an opportunity to make their submissions to this country for which as i have said both sides in this terrible dispute still have high regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> i think that even she will agree that it is a pretty awful and sterile answer that we cannot even get some idea of unity among nato to talk with the warsaw pact people <e> <s> is she not aware of the fact and can she give verification of it that it was mr gorbachev who advocated verification on site between russia and america and that senator thomas oneills visit and that of the congressmen to the ussr also supported some idea of ongoing talks between nato and the warsaw pact countries <e> <s> will she as many american senators have done support senator thomas oneill and can she say whether the british government do so as well <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness very briefly to appreciate that in so far as it is now visible for all to see under mr gorbachevs leadership there seems to be a much more realistic appreciation of valuable talks between the united states of america our foremost ally and the soviet union <e> <s> does she not agree that perhaps nato could make some mighty effort and have representatives as well joining in to try to secure that the st century should become the first century of life without fear of universal death <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that reply which will seem to obscure more than it reveals until we see what appears in his written reply <e> <s> would it be fair to say that by and large public expenditure has over the past five years increased annually <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord says as he did that it has been declining since why cannot he answer the question and give us the percentage <e> <s> how does he know that what he is saying is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords may i now reveal the purpose of the question which the general public are entitled to know since they were told that the government would steadily decrease the percentage of public spending <e> <s> will the noble lord now explain why the government said that they would decrease public spending when in point of fact it has increased <e>", "<cs> my lords despite what the noble lord lord chalfont has said will the noble earl bear in mind that the reality of the situation is that some of <e>", "<cs> my lords in support of his submission that when oil prices drop so also do gas prices can the noble lord give us one example to substantiate this claim <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say what is the current situation with regard to the recruitment of specialist student nurses to become specialists in this particular field and whether there is any improvement in the situation in various parts of the country where this form of training has been instituted <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble baroness explain to the house just what is hypothetical about million of our fellow human beings who happen to have a different skin pigmentation from the noble baroness and myself <e> <s> would she not agree that it is an appalling reality that they are living in the sort of fascism that this nation helped so much to destroy in the last war <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness be prepared at least to say that while freedom fighters sometimes can be embarrassing and sometimes get themselves into a situation which does not do them much good on balance it is far better to be a freedom fighter than an appeaser as we learned in <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard statements from mr shcharansky senator kennedy and many other prominent allies to our cause who say that this is the best time ever for a good relationship between president reagan and mr gorbachev <e> <s> therefore is it not a good thing that the government should dismiss silly things said about this incident and also say properly and profoundly that we hope that this ridiculous behaviour brought to our notice so capably by my noble friend lord jenkins of putney will have no damaging effect on future discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that in view of the figures he has announced two things will now follow the substantial import of coal from many other foreign countries will now be reduced and pits which are threatened will now be reprieved <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the period about which he is talking is not the past few months <e> <s> there has been a massive increase in unemployment for four years year in and year out <e> <s> is he not aware that all sections of this house as well as in another place are becoming a little tired of these rancid answers and excuses <e> <s> the president of the cbi has condemned them as has the tuc and i think that most people in the house would also condemn them <e> <s> i appeal to the government let us have no more excuses let us have action <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the yts which seems to be improving can the noble lord say what is the attitude of the government to the joint <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that there is consternation generally throughout the country on both sides of industry and in the city about the large portions of british industry that are now passing into the control of the united states of america <e> <s> that situation could be very serious for our future <e> <s> if there should be any grievous slump i cannot imagine for one moment that any responsible american would see to it that americans will suffer first before the british or anyone else <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that there is a very serious aspect to the original question namely that in many parts of britain where people are aspiring to represent britain in the olympic games there are nothing like the facilities that are provided by other governments by other countries particularly in relation to swimming <e> <s> is the noble minister aware that this is something that successive governments have ignored in that they have been unwilling to help and to provide the kinds of facilities which will enable our young britons to prepare themselves when they take part in international games and particularly the world olympics <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that this is not merely a matter of the gruesome aspect of unemployment or of statistics <e> <s> the gruesome truth is that it does not matter in what form the statistics are arrived at <e> <s> what is beyond any doubt whatsoever is that year in and year out under this government unemployment has increased <e> <s> while the numbers themselves are increasing and therefore the consequences for the economy are very serious will the noble lord the minister be prepared to accept that for a family in which the breadwinner has been on the dole for a year or two and for the youths in our cities who have never had a job the one fundamental need is to reduce unemployment and not to calculate it with statistics <e> <s> that is what the government ought to apply their minds to in the interests of those who are unemployed and of the economy of our nation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that that answer confuses the issue more than ever and that it is now totally perplexing <e> <s> is the noble and learned lord further aware that because this matter was brought to the forefront in the westland issue masses of ordinary people up and down the country including lawyers and skilled parliamentarians cannot understand why it is possible for someone to leak a letter from the solicitor-general without him knowing it and be given a private assurance by another minister that if they committed this act which seems to be an offence they would be covered for it <e> <s> would he not agree that this is disturbing right through the ranks of parliament and the country in general <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord saying that it is not possible whatsoever to tell a cabinet minister or any other minister about shielding civil servants who wish at his or her desire to leak information to the public press <e> <s> does that also apply under the official secrets act to a highly sensitive defensive issue which could be of use to a foreign power that provided that civil servant is guarded by a minister all will be well and there is nothing to worry about <e> <s> that is what the general public are asking

answer this is it right for us to understand that the government advanced the view that the date should be extended in the peradventure that someone else might put in a bid <e> <s> then they went to those who had already put in the bid and who said no we do not want any more delay and so the government caved in <e> <s> is that the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not an answer <e>", "<cs>

much as we would acknowledge a speech made by president reagan <e>", "<cs> by marcos <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we are all heartened by the message that our government have sent to the new president of the philippines <e> <s> that i sincerely believe will give encouragement as it will fill the hearts of many british people with happiness <e> <s> however having said that we must have the courage to acknowledge that a murdering terrorist president who killed people by the hundreds of thousands over a number of years and who was one of the worlds greatest terrorists received the full backing of president reagan and the united states of america <e> <s> would not president reagan and the united states have been well advised if they had only listened to the british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister ask his colleagues at the foreign office to make sure that the united states does not compound the felony by offering assistance and help to a murderous president of the philippines who ordered the murder of the husband of the present president to whom we have sent congratulations <e> <s> can we have an assurance that he will not receive succour from the united states or any other freedom-loving country <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that these voluntary organisations in peacetime as much as in war are usually required in the great conurbations such as london merseyside west yorkshire and so on <e> <s> would it not be sensible to create an overall body which could bring all these smaller councils together so that the voluntary organisations could then fructify and be able to give first-class service <e> <s> for example an organisation which will not be in existence for much longer the

in the first year to which my question relates that is the last year of the labour government unemployment was decreasing <e> <s> is he aware that all his endeavours to call the figures in a different way do not take away from the agony of the family of someone who has been on the dole for a year or two <e> <s> this is not merely a question of statistics for there are many cases of absolute agony in the homes of millions of british families <e> <s> is that a fact which the minister also takes into account <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister honestly believe that a family in which the breadwinner has been on the dole for a few years and which has suffered the anguish which that brings will be filled full of joy about the figures for europe that he has just read out and will be ever so happy <e> <s> will the noble lord reply to the first part of my question which he has failed to answer <e> <s> is it not a fact that in the final year of the last labour government unemployment was decreasing <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge the ministers tenacity in trying to find an answer to this question of grave unemployment but he has been totally unsuccessful <e> <s> the minister mentioned other efforts that we could make <e> <s> would it be possible for the government to consider the situation as it once existed in america where when pared to the bone and finding themselves in a terrible situation with unemployment almost worse than we have today a scottish economist and keynes worked out a system that was accepted by the president of the united states and i hope that this government do not dismiss franklin d roosevelt <e> <s> they provided an answer based on spend and prosper <e> <s> does the minister not agree that that was a much better response than the ridiculous banality that we were offered by the present chairman of the conservative party when he was employment minister that if there were million bicycles then million jobs could be found by people travelling around this country on their bikes <e> <s> will the minister give the house an assurance that such total nonsense will not be entertained by him <e>", "<cs> my lords does the lord the minister agree that this question of unemployment is now attacking the moral fibre of millions of families in the united kingdom <e> <s> does he accept that there are youngsters in our great cities who are turning to crime that there are men trying to eke out a living to feed their families and who cannot entertain any idea of paying the rent in any way whatever <e> <s> for example in the

minister please understand that this is a grave and serious issue which is afflicting our nation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that what the noble lord says is correct but does he agree that that definition probably existed when the luftwaffe was dropping bombs on london and that those sort of words are not much use <e> <s> is there not some justification that animates these loathsome terrorists who slay innocent people on aircraft or at airports primarily the occupation of their homeland whether by the russians in afghanistan others in the middle east or cia agents in south america <e> <s> is that not the root cause <e> <s> great britain has never indulged in that venal activity unlike the united states <e> <s> does he accept that even though people who behave in that appalling manner have to punished at the same time we should try to stop such invasions <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that it is necessary to combat terrorism wherever it exists and even more necessary to try to prevent it and that it is sometimes born out of frustration at the occupation of the terrorists homeland <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister not agree that there are some aspects of the british motor industry which have been extremely useful to british industry as a whole and indeed to british defence <e> <s> does he not agree that it was quite correct not to have allowed the famous rolls-royce engine to wither on the vine and that it should have been taken into public ownership if only for its massive contribution not merely to the economy but to this islands defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my appreciation of the support that i have received

noble baroness has explained that there are difficulties between great britain and iran and that the normal diplomatic sources do not exist <e> <s> usually in those circumstances some other government will act on behalf of the other two <e> <s> is that situation being examined by the foreign office so that the matter can be properly cleared up <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has quite correctly said that the key to all this seems to be verification acceptable to both sides <e> <s> would it not be possible for her majestys government to consider talking to the united states and to the ussr to

beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his reply <e> <s> i am sure he would agree that the official secrets act is an essential and vitally important piece of legislation <e> <s> could he perhaps enlighten the house as to the authority under which ministers can grant immunity from that act of parliament to certain civil servants who gives them that authority and whether they in turn are able to enjoy any form of immunity in relation to actions of theirs which might contravene the official secrets act <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that that reply could be given to almost every supplementary asked on a question put down on the order paper in your lordships house <e> <s> this is not a frivolous matter a large number of people think it is very important indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the subsequent replies to supplementaries may i now take it i do not expect the government to make a comprehensive statement that in the not too distant future they will assure this house the other place and indeed the nation where there is some concern as to what happened over the westland affair that they are prepared to have a sensible hard look at the official secrets act in the interests of our nation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that there is one small aggravation in the film which has grown enormously since and which is causing grave concern not only to those who are sick but to the nurses themselves <e> <s> have we not now reached the appalling situation where if a student nurse is successful in her examinations becomes a state registered nurse or a state registered midwife and is living in what we call a nurses home she may get threatened with eviction <e> <s> does she not think that such practices ought to be looked at by her department <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the things that follows from the reduction in oil prices this may be a small matter but to millions of motorists it is important is that there should be a reduction in the price of petrol at the pumps <e> <s> the chancellor has indicated that because of cheap oil he has added a few more pence to the price of petrol and that he was confident that the private companies which own the petrol stations would see that that was not passed on <e> <s> it now appears that they have completely ignored the promise given by britains chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> do the government intend to do anything about it

baroness aware that it is very grim to have to say in this house that during the winter hundreds of our older citizens have died from hypothermia and there does not seem to be much evidence that the government are doing a great deal about it <e> <s> does the noble baroness agree that one cause of these deaths has been the type of heating some of these old people have and particularly those who live alone because it is totally insufficient <e> <s> would it not be an idea for local authorities to know when old people are living alone so that during such extremely inclement weather they can he

views of the british foreign secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness not agree that there were some people who thought that what was happening in germany was being carried out by a government who were bonkers <e> <s> we had to pay a massive bill to prevent that particular form of government ruling europe if not the world <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that nobody

grateful to the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> will she not be prepared to consider that the vast amount of publicity that has been given to president reagans recent statements that it might be

use of the cia in his country in nicaragua and in el salvador <e> <s> by contrast we have heard a magnificent speech made by the british foreign secretary in which he condemned what the russians have done in invading other countries <e> <s> how can we support our foreign secretary as we ought to do when we are a little shy of condemning the americans when they threaten to do precisely what the ussr has done in afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble viscount lord montgomery of alamein and to congratulate him on bringing this vexed but important subject onto our agenda

laws apply to every day and are an embarrassment every day <e> <s> can he further say whether the government are prepared to look at the debate that took place in this house last night and the tremendously erudite and realistic propositions contained therein which i think will undoubtedly help the tourist industry <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he not agree that the government of to may not have been a perfect government but they certainly sought to create a good economic base for the nation <e> <s> the tragedy was the years that followed when all that was

an important issue you may be prepared to examine it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that when nuclear weapons were owned by just a few powerful nations there was not perhaps so great a risk but the really grave risk which now faces mankind is that so many other nations all over the globe are seeking to possess this detestable weapon <e> <s> therefore will the government give full support to examining any proposal for a test ban treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords have we not got to appreciate that the soviet union under mr gorbachev have taken a brand new attitude <e> <s> he has

british government with their experience to initiate something that could be not only for the benefit of this country but for all mankind <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness saying that it is the policy of her majestys government in no way to seek abandonment of thermonuclear weapons no matter who has them <e> <s> further does she not agree that simply because some of the major powers have

taken before the agreement was reached with president reagan <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister will be gracious enough to allow a question which might be on the edge of the original question <e> <s> there is a serious problem affecting about million people throughout the country <e> <s> they have rented houses from private owners and in desperation to get homes have signed to accept full responsibility for maintaining that rented property and then they find that they cannot afford to do so <e> <s> can that matter be taken on board for consideration <e>", "<cs> my

family and who has been unemployed for a year or two how much worse matters would have been were he a frenchman a german or an italian <e> <s> is one to tell such a man that million jobs have been created when million people as well as him have not had one of them <e> <s> all the juggling with figures really makes people who are out of work angry <e> <s> it increases their despair <e>", "<cs>

those measures is now per cent <e> <s> however will the noble baroness be gracious enough to consider the fact that although a per cent <e> <s> uptake is recorded for measles and whooping cough they are both killer diseases and there has been some recurrence of these among children <e> <s> will she give this house an assurance that that aspect will be looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness allow me to take advantage of the very good atmosphere at present to mention the remarkable work which is being done on the preventive medicine side of the national health service and to ask whether she will be gracious enough to look at the critical part of the comptrollers report concerning the -odd health authorities which in his opinion are not doing enough to combat cervical cancer <e> <s> far too many women who are just over years of age are dying and as the report says with more intense activity in those health authorities the number could be drastically reduced <e>", "<cs> my

raised <e> <s> i am sure that the country would be very pleased with both of us in our joint endeavours to enhance our national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister not agree that what is causing grave irritation in the tin mining industry in cornwall is that those involved management and workers realise that because of this country sticking to its own si and to the

management and the skilled craftsmen <e> <s> i shall ask my question now as the minister earlier suggested <e> <s> the workers in the industry are aware that while we adhere to our own statutory

also aware that they are now living in an era in which we have the fastest growing unemployment ever in our industry <e> <s> this point too plays an important role and is one of the matters which the minister ought to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i bear in mind and appreciate what the minister has said <e> <s> however would he not agree that the royal festival hall is the quality cultural centre of not only london but the united kingdom and that there are many people involved in these great activities who are somewhat apprehensive as to its future <e> <s> will the minister give some assurance and make some statement if not today at some time to assuage those fears <e>", "<cs> my lords on an issue of this magnitude surely the government or the department responsible should not be concerned with brand names or labels stuck on bottles but should just say that the whole lot is banned <e> <s> firm action should be taken as regards any consignments that arrived in this country before the outbreak came to light in italy <e> <s> simply to look for brand names would seem to ordinary people to be an absurdity <e> <s> the government should say that no one here should sell or drink italian

wait the post office should anticipate the queue apologise and explain that that is the result of shortage of staff <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware of what causes the grave apprehension <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister appreciate that notwithstanding his efforts to reduce unemployment the real and most massive failure of this government and of his department is

example it appears that the german and sometimes the french equivalents of our training board seem to have more assistance and to be doing a more efficient job <e> <s> that is a genuine reason for concern on both sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that what the building industry really requires is to be building something somewhere <e> <s> the whole object of

course one can only agree with what the prime minister has said <e> <s> but there now seems a danger in so far as both super powers are accusing each other of breach of salt h and the ibm treaties

that the united states dismantles two poseidon submarines one month and in the next increases the cruise missiles on the b aircraft it is this sort of thing that makes the situation difficult <e> <s> perhaps the role of our country should be to intercede and ask that there should be frank and full discussions not in any way to destroy the possibility of a successful summit in december <e> <s> one way to do that if i may reiterate it is to concentrate on a foolproof system of verification to present to nato the warsaw pact countries and the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister please tell us what is the sticking point on the charges made to the soviet union and the charges that they make against the united states <e> <s> can we not examine what those charges are so that we can make a contribution to finding a solution <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a number of members of your lordships house were guests of the post office a fortnight or three weeks ago <e> <s> we visited one of the major post offices in the country and we were shown the difference between what happens when a post code appears on a letter and when one does not <e> <s> therefore the post office always recommends please put in the post code <e> <s> can it not slowly but surely see that the post code is put into telephone directories <e> <s> it cannot do it in one fell swoop but it ought to be its policy ultimately to achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister accept that we can hardly get a fair estimate of the situation particularly when irrespective of what the index says the lowest group in great britain which has been increasing is bound to be much worse off than anyone on average pay or for whom the index does not reflect the true situation <e> <s> much of this appalling poverty is not revealed by the price index and the government ought to find some other system of ascertaining who these people are and of helping them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister consider as a further measure contacting those learned societies that specialise in science and technology who are of the opinion that by advancing science and technology they can create more jobs while not necessarily bringing down the level of unemployment <e> <s> they believe also that they can make a contribution to achieving that which the minister wants to achieve by christmas a massive reduction in unemployment from the point of view of encouraging science and technology with the government giving a lead <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister agree i think he is bound to do so that all civilised people and all civilised nations must be totally and absolutely opposed to any form of terrorism and to any financiers of terrorists <e> <s> will he not further <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it takes more than a trivial remark to prevent me from saying what i have to say <e> <s> i am very concerned about the future of the people of gibraltar <e> <s> therefore i ask the noble baroness whether she is in a position to tell the house this afternoon that before any ultimate decision is made the people of gibraltar who have always exhibited such great loyalty to great britain will be fully consulted and that nothing will be done until such consultation has taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness for that reply and i am sure that the many thousands of britons who are members of that minority religion will also be grateful for what she has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not agree that the bahais in iran are suffering from organised government tyranny and although that government might be led by a crackpot will she in no way take any notice of that fact <e> <s> it is an appalling policy to say that because a state leader poses as a crackpot he will receive no condemnation from anyone <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will resist any such suggestion <e> <s> i return to her first words in reply to my question which i know for certain will give so much encouragement and hope to the bahai people in our country and throughout the world <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that what he said in reply to my noble friends question about monitoring is very welcome <e> <s> but what steps will be taken if it indicates serious contamination of foodstuffs <e> <s> what warning will be given <e> <s> how will foodstuffs be withdrawn from stores and how will other contaminated foodstuffs be prevented from finding their way on to the table of the ordinary family <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say what was the basis of the error <e> <s> should he not respond to the last part of my noble friends question and give the assurance that whatever happened then enough examination will take place to make sure that so far as is humanly possible such a thing never happens again <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the noble lord did infer that there had been a certain amount of cheating or whatever you may call it in respect of the salt ii treaty by the soviet union <e> <s> is she also aware that this is completely and absolutely contrary to the views of people like senator john chafee head of the bipartisan group which recently went to see president reagan to urge him to ignore people making noises to the effect that the soviet union had been breaking the treaty <e> <s> the breaking-up of the salt ii treaty would be very dangerous <e> <s> would it not be much better if the government instead of opting to side with those who support president reagan took a reasoned middle course and saw both points of view so that we do not find ourselves unnecessarily interfering in the politics of the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that generally speaking the attitude of the government to try to save salt ii is absolutely correct <e> <s> what the government are doing wrong it is the difference between right and wrong which i hope president reagan will understand is failing to recognise that there are important people in the united states like senator chafee who believe that wrong information is being given out <e> <s> i refer to the words of congressmen in the united states <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware and if not she might like to check of what was stated by congressman dicks the key figure in setting the united states military budget who stated that under salt ii the russians had dismantled almost times the number of missiles that had been dismantled by the united states <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that in advocating a middle course i was taking cognisance of what the senator said as well as what has been said by the extreme right-wing in the united states <e> <s> we want the truth not so much to assist any particular party but for the benefit possibly of the whole of mankind through a system of verification <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that the restaurateurs association has done a great deal itself in trying to attract people to the industry <e> <s> it has been prepared to spend money and to hold all forms of display to encourage folk <e> <s> all that i ask is that the minister should be prepared to contact the association and perhaps offer it the assistance that it so richly deserves in providing employment for many people through the vacancies that it knows exist <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is prepared to consider in relation to all aspects of the question whether an officer from his department could meet with a representative from the restaurateurs association to examine everything that has been mentioned in the house today <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that what is required is a more massive determination among all the great powers to eradicate this appalling curse <e> <s> could not our government soon to be in the chair of the ec make this eradication a substantial item for international action <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that that is indeed an encouraging reply <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that there also seems to be room for a great deal of interplay and co-operation <e> <s> would he not further agree that since the chernobyl disaster there are very luminous question marks about nuclear energy and that if we could conquer acid rain that would mean that britain would have a massive accumulation of reserve power that would be very worthwhile developing <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that this discussion has been very useful and that most people would applaud what this house has done this afternoon <e> <s> therefore could he not perhaps have discussions with his noble friend the leader of the house as to whether one day we might have a fuller debate on this vital subject <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the newspaper from which he quoted says today that the british national health service is at its most poverty stricken since its inception <e> <s> however there is a way in which the noble lord is absolutely correct <e> <s> those who have made money out of the national health service through the griffiths report those who have made money from the selling off of great british assets the nationalisation of which was absolutely approved of in the election of by british ex-servicemen have never had it so good <e> <s> what those who have never had it so good have forfeited is their patriotism <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord should tell us now about british patriotism <e>", "<cs> my lords answerable to no one <e>", "<cs> my lords does the leader of the house agree that the ec statement seems to be at some variance with the views of members of the british commonwealth of nations <e> <s> does he not further agree that in so far as all of us wish sincere best wishes to the right honourable and learned gentleman the foreign secretary is it not possible that when pretoria learnt that sir geoffrey howe was going it stated that there was not much point in his visit <e> <s> in view of that is it not fairly absurd for the british foreign secretary to visit a country that does not even wish to talk to him <e> <s> ought we not to try to secure from south africa an agreement that it will be prepared to speak to our foreign secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not another aspect that the minister might be prepared to look at <e> <s> the tariff rates announced on st april and st july seem to be at total variance with statements made by the electricity council <e> <s> is not the brutal truth that electricity prices are going up and will probably continue to go up <e> <s> i am reminded of an ancient quotation one part of the statistics reminds me of one part and the remainder of the statement reminds me of the other part <e> <s> this is a serious situation for both the council and for the minister who is ultimately responsible and it should be investigated <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the government leave many of us on this side of the house and indeed very many eminent people in the great british commonwealth of nations in a state of some quandary because it seems that this government look at this international problem with concern showing in one eye and with a form of cunning calculation shining out of the other <e> <s> also i think it is a mistake for people to make comparisons which really are not comparisons <e> <s> i have in mind something said by the noble lord lord beloff and again later by the noble lord lord chalfont <e>", "<cs> my lords in a minute <e> <s> i just want to say this <e> <s> if we are not careful this growing issue will not remain simply with south africa <e> <s> it will become a world issue where black people everywhere will make a judgment and i do not want them to be scolding or even finding any fault in this nation of ours <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to explain it in simpler terms <e> <s> the noble lord lord chalfont moaned about the horrendous and horrific things which are probably happening in south africa <e> <s> those were born in my judgment not of hatred for whites by blacks but of hatred for apartheid <e> <s> this is what i meant when i said that blacks all over the world will find it objectionable <e>", "<cs> my lords if as the noble baroness has said our government are in contact with the united states government on such issues will she tell the house whether for the forthcoming summit which seems to be almost a certainty one of the points which has been agreed by mr gorbachev and president reagan is that they will try not merely to find reductions in nuclear weapons but will genuinely seek a full examination by both sides to try to reduce what are sometimes called conventional arms <e>", "<cs> my lords i was sorry to miss the first part of the answer repeated by the noble baroness <e> <s> we all wish god speed and good luck to the british foreign secretary when he goes to see mr kenneth kaunda and mr mugabe <e> <s> when will he be leaving and can we assume that he will still be going as a representative of the ec as well as of great britain <e> <s> can the noble baroness confirm what has been heard on the wireless though it did not seem to be absolutely certain that one good thing that may have come out of our debate who knows is that mrs winnie mandela has had the restrictions on her movements removed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness not admit that part of the argument is that many private organisations in many countries that ought to have imposed sanctions on various other countries indulged in what is now being called massive disrespect of the law of their lands by sanctions busting <e> <s> do the government agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking now in my capacity as president of the largest area of the royal british legion the metropolitan area and being associated with blesma the british limbless ex-servicemens association i am very grateful indeed that the noble lord is keeping the door ajar in looking at the valuable amendment moved by my noble friend lord stoddart <e> <s> i ask him to consider this <e> <s> among the tens of thousands of new old age pensioners this year a large percentage will be british ex-servicemen who served from to <e> <s> that applies to the womer as well <e> <s> among the disabled will be a considerable number who are limbless ex-service and old age pensioners and who have managed somehow or other to eke out a living <e> <s> therefore i should be most grateful if the noble lord the minister will be gracious enough to make representations on the points i have made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the amendment is worth supporting <e> <s> the noble baroness said that the cegb does not need wrapping in cotton-wool <e> <s> but we had to establish the office of fair trading because there was so much cheating and swindling in private industry <e> <s> had that not been so we should not have established it <e> <s> we should not take a chance <e> <s> if we are sensible we will acknowledge that there is sense in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i thank him for what he has just said and ask him whether he would clarify a point for me <e> <s> i listened very intently to what he had to say <e> <s> he seemed to indicate that the central electricity generating board could carry on what he called a massive and expensive television advertising programme and that no doubt the new gas plc will do the same <e> <s> they will carry on using his words a very expensive television programme <e> <s> however will that not inevitablv put up prices <e> <s> do we not all know that the people who pay the price for television advertisements are the consumers <e> <s> rather than have a television war which can be massively expensive and for which the consumer will pay because that is who will pay otherwise they would not indulge in it would it not be far better that there be written into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister an additional point to that submitted by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> does he accept that in some areas of the country there are families where more than one member of the family have been unemployed for over a year <e> <s> it is a sad and serious situation <e> <s> is it possible for the minister to take that factor into account and to give as much help as possible to those areas w here that statistic applies <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the last absurd proposal does not apply to the majority of people in british industry or in our services <e> <s> what is required was mentioned in the point made by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> in addition to having a top salaries review board can we have a very low wages review board so as to strike a balance between those who are drastically underpaid such as nurses who are slowly catching up and those who have had excessive pay increases which amounted to more than a state registered nurses years salary <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness ask her majestys government to point out to the soviet foreign minister that this country under both labour and conservative governments has shown an exemplary example by having nothing to do with chemical weapons <e> <s> at the same time will she consider asking the soviet foreign secretary when he visits this country whether he will take back representations from our government on the withdrawal of foreign troops from afghanistan and from those countries in the middle east occupied by israel <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of mr gorbachevs progressive measures might it be a good thing to point out to the foreign secretary of the ussr the grave apprehension felt in this country for men and women of great professions in the ussr who are suffering discrimination and who have a degree of fear when they do not fall in line with the views of the government of that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that according to press reports today in <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the attitude taken by some people that sanctions would hurt the black folk in africa is the noble baroness not aware that many people believe that if france belgium and other occupied countries under nazi-ism which suffered our bombing and the invasion had taken the same view we probably would not have won the war <e> <s> why is it that we feel that black people have not got the same courage as europeans <e> <s> finally would the noble baroness not agree that the statements made by the prime ministers of india canada australia and new zealand are in no way hypothetical instances <e> <s> will she state to this house now that the government of this country will support those prime ministers and the black prime ministers in their endeavours to bring apartheid to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether the target ranges set out in the budget speech had anything whatsoever to do with the statement that he the noble lord made in this house that because of that budget speech there could well be a big reduction in unemployment by christmas <e> <s> is that still the position notwithstanding the statements and despite the fact that the targets set out in the budget speech have not been attained <e> <s> will that mean that there will not be much reduction in unemployment after all <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that that is indeed a very welcome reply to a very important question <e> <s> is he further aware that people in education in industry and in commerce take the view that the special creation that he has mentioned in the field of electronics will be very welcome because of its close association with computers and advanced technology <e> <s> am grateful to the noble earl for his reply <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the chancellor has given an encouraging start to those charities who spend a great deal of money on goods which are covered by vat and therefore have a very large vat bill <e> <s> does the noble lord not agree that for those charities which are heavily involved in making purchases on which they have to pay vat although the relief that has been given is a good start it is worth pursuing and ought to be increased <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness at least inform the house whether in the discussions that have been held with mr philip habib there has been expressed apprehension at the attitude of the united states to central america <e> <s> if that has been done is it possible to convey to the president of the united states britains misgivings about us attitudes and behaviour toward certain central and south american states <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that his qualities of leadership have been recognised by everybody in this house <e> <s> many of us believe that he has strong qualities of trade union negotiation and of trade union leadership <e> <s> will he use those qualities on our behalf in places where he needs to do so <e> <s> we all have complete confidence in him <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that this is a very sad occasion for this noble house <e> <s> i could understand if the benches opposite had been crowded as they are because the issue was one of defence education or the environment <e> <s> but the issue is that there is a nuance or difference not much really between what the government are proposing and the admirable amendments of lord henderson <e> <s> what we are talking about are not massive defence issues education or environment we are discussing what is best for the cripples in our society <e> <s> to think that these little differences should appear so massive i am bound to say fills me with distress <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that despite the governments hopes in the facts are that since lrt took over there has been a million-mile cut in routage garages have been closed bus crews sacked to join the dole queue to cause more trouble for his noble friend on the front bench and the london regional passenger committee has said <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the proposals the government make concerning the evil of the drug situation are very encouraging and absolutely the correct kind of action that this country and the foreign office ought to take in this situation <e> <s> can the noble baroness tell the house whether or not in addition to the south american sources involved in the drugs issue and the excellent action that the government propose america and canada ought to be approached for contributions that they might be able to make to the governments endeavours <e>", "<cs> my lords if the secretary of state was shocked by the press reports ought they not to be thoroughly investigated especially if they are causing grave disturbance throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as this was an automated crossing and the inquiry may discover something that went wrong would it be possible to ask british rail to make sure that all other automatic crossings throughout the country are immediately examined rather than simply waiting for an inquiry to tell us what went wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the considerable experience at regional level of the cbi the tuc and the small businessmens industrial associations would it be possible for the government to get those elements the tuc the cbi and the small businessmens associations to co-operate at regional level in assisting the endeavours of the noble lord the minister himself <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say whether or not any of that aid found its way to south africa bearing in mind that every year children under five die from malnutrition in south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that those of us who wished our foreign secretary all good fortune and godspeed in his difficult task acknowledging that he was speaking not for this country but for the european community as well consider that his summary dismissal by botha was indicative of what that country thinks of the opinion of the rest of europe <e> <s> will not the noble baroness also agree that most political parties in western europe and in the united kingdom as well as the united states congress approved of the report of the eminent persons group and that they were sabotaged <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness for that reply which appears to mean that there were consultations and that consultations will continue after the meeting <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the noble baroness whether it would be possible in the interests of the nation and not merely those of this chamber by itself for us to have a statement immediately the consultations between mr gorbachev and president reagan have been concluded so that the nation may have some idea of the reaction of the british government to the talks of our ally the united states with the soviet unions leader <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not agree that in the statement made by mr neil kinnock at the labour party conference he declared emphatically that we are the firm allies of the united states of america <e> <s> is she further aware that on th march this house presaged the idea of what should take place in discussions which might ultimately bring the world away from the edge of total disaster <e> <s> therefore if we are to have consultations with the americans as our allies we should seek some way as swiftly as possible of informing our nation <e> <s> what we are really talking about in these negotiations is war and peace and there may never be another opportunity to secure for all mankind a march towards peace rather than towards war <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one aspect which is causing concern to staff in these kinds of hospitals <e> <s> first they are all at grave risk of being physically injured themselves and sometimes when they have no alternative

dangerous advice <e> <s> his submissions and arguments on fact are irrefragable <e> <s> they cannot be questioned because their accuracy is absolute but are we going to say that the words of any

commons <e> <s> that is how it appeared to us then and that is the situation now <e>", "<cs> i think it is probably right as the noble baroness said and as i said earlier that this is not an argument on whether or not we stay in the european community <e> <s> we are in the community and that was decided by a referendum <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord said we are discussing the amendment <e> <s> we

states congress there have been serious complaints that the contras aided by the cia have committed appalling acts of terrorism and that many in the congress believe that this should cease as indeed the noble baroness has said <e> <s> will the government make representations to the united states government that they cannot on the one hand rightly condemn the ira and those who harbour terrorists while on the on other hand they are prepared to aid and finance other forms of terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that there are some aspects of the success following reykjavik which must cause grave and bitter disappointment to those who are determined somehow or other to find no joy in the ultimate possibility of the great nuclear powers of the world coming to some agreement on disarmament <e> <s> will the noble baroness agree that one of the fundamental features the linchpin to the whole talks could well he the total acceptability on both sides of verification both on tests and on manoeuvres in either thewarsaw or nato <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that in this incredibly difficult situation where this country finds itself unwittingly involved in a secret operation the quicker we get ourselves out of the common market the better <e> <s> that is a real proposition <e> <s> there is nothing secret about that <e> <s> is he prepared to make strong representations via meps with the aid of our ministers to the european community and say that the type of procedure about which we have heard today would never occur if the normal rules of our country were used and that they should be changed <e> <s> the ec should run its affairs in the way that we run our affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that notwithstanding the fact that little negotiation was entered into by the employers side and such negotiation might have prevented much of what has gone on the fact that it has gone on is no excuse for there now to be no proper negotiation between the sides <e> <s> he was right when he said that every month throughout the year negotiations between trade unions and managements are embarked upon in britain with agreeable conclusions <e> <s> is he further aware that he was also right when he pointed out that people can demonstrate but that it is those who go outside that freedom to demonstrate and use violence and other unlawful means who must be condemned and not the british protestor <e>", "<cs> if i may i should like to say a few things about what the noble lord lord nugent has said <e> <s> i can well understand the fervour as the noble lord put it of the submission made by my noble friend lord bruce <e> <s> i was privileged to be elected by the british parliament to serve in the european parliament and one of the major points we could always make as members of all our political parties was that if we saw things that we thought were wrong or unjust we could always say that we would report these matters back to the british parliament <e> <s> to a great degree that had a remarkable effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness for that encouraging reply <e> <s> when she talked about in the event of an attack does that mean that nuclear weapons could be used if there were a conventional attack by the russians or is she saying that the russians must use a nuclear weapon before nato will retaliate <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that this question is serious <e> <s> will she make it clear that she meant that on its own britain would never hurl a thermo-nuclear bomb at anybody but that it may be necessary to do so in conjunction with our nato partners <e> <s> the only thing we can do to try to reduce that risk is to improve our conventional weapons and to encourage our nato allies to do the same so that the eventuality that i have just mentioned need never arise <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness not aware that people are alarmed <e> <s> does she not agree that those who were not born at the time but who have seen films of nagasaki believe it would be a frightful situation if that could possibly happen again <e> <s> they see no humour whatever in the matter <e> <s> anyone who does so needs to be medically examined <e> <s> can the noble baroness say that it would be in an extreme circumstance that we should be compelled within nato to use the nuclear weapon but that in order to try to avert that we shall build on our nuclear force make our conventional forces as modern as possible and provide the attractive conditions in which people find satisfaction in being part of the british armed forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the minister for his reply and the work he has obviously done to arrive at the answer <e> <s> would he not agree that it is a rather serious situation when we are spending so much in order to count and pay those of our fellow britons who are unemployed <e>

unemployment began to decrease from million to almost million <e> <s> it was decreasing <e> <s> what has happened thereafter which has now sent the figure soaring to nearly million <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house would agree that the noble lord has striven to introduce all sorts of schemes to help alleviate the effects of unemployment <e> <s> would he not agree that that is not enough <e> <s> it is not possible to give comfort to any british family where the breadwinner and the son are on the dole by saying but do not worry so are the french so are the west germans so are

lords is there anything in hand to make use of the training when it is completed by the young people so that they can carry on being employed using the training they have received and not simply be

science who specialise in trying to tackle dyslexia are of the opinion that there is an increase in the number of children who suffer from dyslexia which is disturbing and that there is an urgent need not merely to halt the increase but to try to start curing dyslexia <e> <s> that is why they are asking that more money should be made available and a special department set up within the department of education and science or some medical department to liaise in order to try to reduce the incidence of dyslexia and then to find a cure for it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that

the first supplementary question of my noble friend lord hatch of lusby are indeed to be welcomed <e> <s> they were forthright and declared unequivocally that we in no way support the south african

and women around years of age dying because they are too cold almost to live <e> <s> i do not find any humour in this situation unlike some of your lordships on the benches to my right <e> <s> i find it an extraordinarily serious and dreadful situation that every night we should hear of somebody dying because they have not enough money to keep themselves warm <e> <s> in view of this would it not be possible for the government please to consider the suggestion that they should contact the british medical association some of the local authorities and particularly the voluntary organisations who are concerned with this problem to try to find a formula which will replace the current soulless barren mathematical formula on which they are working <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that it is to be hoped that the review body will take into consideration the fact that midwives have to do extra studying take extra examinations and pass them to become midwives but that there is no reflection of that endeavour in their pay <e> <s> does she agree that that is wrong and also that the review body could be helped if it were to contact the royal college of midwives and the confederation of health service employees who are the real experts on this question <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind what the noble baroness lady cox has said that the situation is reaching crisis proportions <e> <s> is the department at least prepared to consider having consultations at a regional level with the staff associations which know a great deal about this problem

country <e> <s> as regards schemes that have been introduced and that might have some effect for about six months in reducing unemployment is it not the case that the job training scheme was taken

benefits are reduced as they may be in april will those on the job training scheme also have the money that they draw reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that unemployment is not merely a matter of statistics <e> <s> the figures published include a would-be breadwinner who has been unemployed for a few years who has a number of children some of them at school and whose burden of debt is increasing to an alarming degree <e> <s> is he prepared to consider that a lot of people believe that the sudden upsurge of activity by the government is actuated and engendered by the fact that the political atmosphere is becoming redolent with the prospects of a general election rather than by deep concern for the misery of the unemployed which has wrecked and racked this country over the past four years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that the

do is to make sure that all old-age pensioners and very frail people have enough warmth to keep them above the hypothermia line <e> <s> that consideration ought to be the basis of policy rather than the weather forecast <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that in this vicious and terrible business of illegal drugs the real contribution in efforts to reduce it and to bring it under

exceedingly myopic policy held by this government <e> <s> is he further aware that the abandonment by our ally the united states of its former policy of having nothing to do with terrorists in this

jobs and not return to the ranks of the unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the interesting figures that he gave for the steady rise of unemployment in europe in the late s particulary in germany would the noble lord not agree that there was one country where the reverse was true <e> <s> in the last year of the last labour government unemployment was comng down <e> <s> it came down for

noble baroness not agree that these are very vital matters which affect many millions of people let alone the two super powers <e> <s> would she not agree that if we could get something like this

my lord with respect to military and civil aircraft will the noble lords right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary be seeking assistance and confirmation of the endeavours of the british which should be supported with regard to civil aircraft from the ec and with regard to military aircraft from our nato allies <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister in addition to what she has already said whether it would be possible for the government to have discussions with kew gardens and similar institutions which have suffered dramatically because of the storm to ascertain in which way they may be helped to recover some of the treasures which they feel are now in danger <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble baroness on what she has proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord tell the house in outline at least what are the powers which the government may be taking <e> <s> sterling is not so much being pegged at the moment it is completely and absolutely bogged down <e> <s> could he please tell the house what are the powers that the government might take which he mentioned a moment ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge the commendable endeavours of the british foreign secretary in trying to remain absolutely neutral between the belligerents but will the noble lord agree that there is now a quickly changing attitude in the gulf <e> <s> the armilla force is there on patrol on station <e> <s> the united states is under severe attack <e> <s> with other shipping or military shipping of other nations the situation could well get out of hand with disastrous results <e> <s> ought we now to be considering unified action by those who want to see freedom for all shipping in the gulf <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in another place quite recently our foreign secretary said <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> does he not agree that it is perfectly obvious that we are not having much luck with the americans in sustaining the hopes expressed by every knowledgeable political commentator in great britain <e> <s> does he not further agree that the entire situation with regard to the contras and to that part of the world has had some distasteful ramifications in other places <e> <s> would it not have helped the american government if they had accepted the central american peace accord which was signed by president ortega himself and by four other presidents who are noted as tremendous supporters of president reagan and the united states of america <e> <s> that could be the beginning of an end to this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take on board the valid point made by the noble viscount lord montgomery that there seems to be a changing attitude of mind <e>

my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will make further investigations into specific journals in the library he will see what is not unreasonable evidence that some four or five countries are preparing to go this way <e> <s> as a leading nation which always has been sane and sensible in its approach to very many things we could indicate to the united nations that we should try to get these nations which are now starting this business to sign the nonproliferation treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate and thank my noble friend lord lovell-davis for initiating this important debate on a vital report <e> <s> a number of members have naturally mentioned the fact that it was very sad to see free milk go from our schools <e> <s> it is a remarkable coincidence <e> <s> winston churchill said that to give british children free milk was a noble idea <e> <s> mrs thatcher thought so much of that statement that she abolished free milk <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that these terrible events where people do not decide issues by the ballot box but by slaying and killing are to be deplored <e> <s> will he agree that the proposition that britain should always help to bring warring sides together is much to be preferred to having our name linked with countries which welcome civil wars so that they can sell the warring sides arms to butcher and kill each other <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the statement that has been made by the noble lord lord gladwyn which is important namely that iraq is quite prepared to accept the united nations security council resolution that he mentioned can the noble lord confirm or otherwise that statements have recently been issued by the soviet union that it too is becoming more amenable to having some form of international force to see that these resolutions are implemented <e> <s> not only does it support the resolution but is it not asking whether we and the americans will support it in making it a reality <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that two years ago i received a number of letters from people who wrote to me expressing their concern at having bought brand new vehicles through various garages and when the time came for those cars to be serviced they were told that no spare parts were <e>", "<cs> my lords in connection with this problem which the minister himself has called serious can he say whether the government will inquire into why so often the will of the european parliament seems to be totally ignored and flouted by the council of ministers as it has been in this particular instance <e> <s> is he prepared to consider that point and take it on board for discussions with his colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give any details in relation to the reply that he has just given criticising british rail <e> <s> he said that off the cuff so easily and his noble friend asked the question so easily that i think we are entitled to know if he has any details to substantiate that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a small point on behalf of the royal british legion of which i am the metropolitan area president <e> <s> perhaps i may inform the minister that there is anger shock and grief at the moment but mostly anger <e> <s> will the government endeavour to do what they can to stop libya supplying arms to these people <e> <s> that is shocking <e> <s> it is even worse when they can get financial assistance from the country we regard as our greatest ally <e> <s> the united states of america cannot have it both ways <e> <s> this matter is creating a great deal of anger and i can speak with some authority among members of the royal british legion <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a very touching and moving subject has been introduced in this question <e> <s> that is especially true in terms of those who may have been associated with those tremendously gallant people who were awarded the vc as was mentioned by my noble friend lord irving <e> <s> is he prepared because of the slightly broader circumstances to get in touch with the senior officers of the royal british legion who will surely be of great help to the minister in doing the right thing by those very remarkable people <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the last point he made is vital to my submission <e> <s> is he aware for example that in the north west thames region where there are calls for cuts of million some hospitals particularly northwick park in harrow have striven to reduce costs <e> <s> northwick park has a turnround of beds in minor cases under which patients are not one hour more in a hospital bed than they need be <e> <s> it has therefore dramatically reduced its waiting lists but the only thanks from the regional health authority have been a threat to close a number of wards <e> <s> does not the minister agree that such action upsets and frustrates the medical profession annoys people who have relatives in hospital and is hardly the policy to encourage hospitals which co-operate with the authorities in reducing expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister prepared to take into account problems created by the recent storm in london for example at st bartholomews hospital <e> <s> the hospital suffered massive damage and the staff worked day and night to transfer patients <e> <s> should not they be relieved of having to close wards which they saved from the storm <e> <s> does not the minister also agree that hospitals which treat cancer patients say that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his reply concerning the establishment of an advisory committee will be very much welcomed by the medical profession as a whole <e> <s> will it be possible when the committee reports for the views contained in the report to be put to the various associations in the medical profession for their examination <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the government are satisfied with the degree of liaison which exists between the weu and nato generally <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that people will be grateful for his reply to the noble countess and that it is a very good thing in so far as it means that regional authorities who think that they are the apex of the nhs <e> <s> in reality are not so <e> <s> is it not the dhss which makes the ultimate decision <e> <s> this time it made the right decision and it should be thanked for doing so <e> <s> is the minister aware that this decision will bring so much relief and contentment to those who are suffering <e> <s> that is something that i feel i should say in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the department and he should be congratulated for <e>", "<cs> then resign my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> i acknowledge that there are formidable practical difficulties in getting full-scale liaison <e> <s> does he agree that there seems to be better co-operation from the ussr and that the british and american naval presence in the gulf work very well together <e> <s> does he further agree that although the difficulties are enormous the government do not regard them as insuperable <e> <s> will we try to move more closely towards unified action by all those involved in the gulf <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it would be a wonderful thing if the soviet union would also say that it would not be the first to use nuclear weapons in any conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords if it has will he not further agree that although mr gorbachev may not yet have done everything we would like him to do he has made remarkable progress <e> <s> it is perhaps in this context of nuclear weapons and the prevention of war in europe that we might reach some new agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords ordinary people do not understand immediately the complicated jargon if i may use that word of lawyers expressions which appears in bills from time to time <e> <s> an ordinary member of the british public would find it very difficult to explain exactly what an act of parliament means <e> <s> we had an interesting debate on this subject some time ago in which the noble and learned lord lord denning said that it was about time that we started to use the english language in the normal way it is used so that british people can understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this problem is not restricted to the west midlands <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that answer which on the face of it seems to be reasonably satisfactory <e> <s> however can she state categorically that it is not the intention of the government to split up the teaching of these subjects and make it part of the responsibility of those who teach <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell the house now whether that would in any way affect the future of those people who have devoted their lives to teaching computer studies alone <e> <s> are we to follow in the steps of the united states of america which is top in computer studies <e> <s> in the usa computer studies constitute a subject taught by specialist computer teachers <e> <s> are we to continue along that line or not <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that the purpose of the question was not to find out what computers would be teaching but to discover whether young people are to be taught how to construct and programme computers so that they can then later on teach many other things <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say whether the increases in electricity costs will also affect the domestic area <e> <s> will the government endeavour to see that poor old-age pensioners and other people who could be put in difficulties by the increased charges will receive some assistance from the dhss to meet the electricity increases which the government now intend to impose <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister why <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that members of both houses of parliament as well as many political commentators think that the creation of such a post would be very worth while <e> <s> it could possibly prevent a future destabilisation of a democratically elected british government which is a task that many of us believed to be its primary objective <e> <s> do the government not care that security services might be involved in a possible destabilisation of british governments <e> <s> will the creation of the office of ombudsman not help to deter such future behaviour <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say that codes of practice by themselves concerning this poignant question of toys which kill damage and harm children are quite insufficient <e> <s> can the minister assure the house that in order to defend british children there will be immediate legislation following the recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords what we are primarily talking about is british children who have toys which may maim or even kill them <e> <s> therefore i again ask the minister whether there is a possibility after our government have made every possible examination that the relevant legislation will be introduced not in the european community but in our british parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the secretary of state for trade and industry did not think that it was worth referring the matter to the mmc <e> <s> having listened to the ill-informed voices of many people and of the british people generally would not a responsible minister agree to say all right very well i will refer it to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> does he agree that that is now the right thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the very important letter that the minister mentioned quite correctly will he agree that the agony is this <e> <s> we cannot ask a letter questions <e> <s> we can only ask a minister questions <e> <s> that is why we should have a short debate <e>", "<cs> my lords on this very important issue with the best will in the world i know that the minister will agree that he does not mean to dismiss it as casually as that <e> <s> when he says that we are having a short debate can he name the date that we shall have it <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm the various reports in responsible newspapers that if a general manager of a health department region or district can bring about closure of a number of wards or indeed the closure of a hospital <e> <s> he is rewarded by an increase in pay which is denied to british nurses <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that the organisations that represent nurses in the national health service the royal college of nursing the confederation of health service employees and the association of home visitors have all expressed grave concern at what they term the vast number of nurses who are leaving the profession <e> <s> would it not be wise for the government to consider having consultations with the royal college the confederation of health service employees and the health visitors association to see what can be done to stop this very dangerous drift of british nurses from the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that we have had this question before as has already been said and we have had the same answers <e> <s> as homelessness increases should there not be selection of certain areas to be provided with the resources to build more homes first to halt the growth in homelessness and in a year or two perhaps to begin to attack the basic problem <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister prepared to consult his right honourable friend about some of the problems now confronting members of the british limbless ex-servicemens association <e> <s> ex <e>", "<cs> my lords what has been particularly encouraging to me in listening to this debate today is that the majority of speakers have agreed that what we have been witnessing in the past week and what we have seen on our television screens and read in our newspapers apropos this whole issue has been the most amazing development in international relations probably since the end of the second world war <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that most encouraging reply <e> <s> in so far as there seems now a new atmosphere between east and west between russia and the usa would it not be a good thing for this government of ours to approach both sides to try to hasten the endeavours that the government are trying to bring about <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as the soviet attitude is changing dramatically and the soviet union supported the un resolutions could it not be made clear to its leaders that the resolution which we the united states and the soviet union all support is also supported by iraq <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that ordinary people find it rather confusing that these massive stores have been built up in this country and on the continent in commodities which are getting dearer and dearer in price <e> <s> is it not about time that we looked at the agricultural policy and tried to introduce some sanity into it instead of continuing to pay through the nose as we have been for the last years <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is deep concern at the parlous state of the national health service not only in birmingham but throughout the entire country <e> <s> if he wants confirmation would he be prepared to ask for the views of the british medical association the surgeons the midwives the nurses and all those who are the fundamental contributors to creating our national health service <e> <s> they are all of one opinion that our nhs is in a parlous state throughout the entire nation <e> <s> what are the government going to do to stop this dismay among all the people who work in our nhs <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister really saying that the nurses representatives the royal college of nursing the health visitors the surgeons and the doctors are giving false information <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that he does not believe the bma that he does not believe cohse and that he does not believe the royal college of nursing <e> <s> is he saying that they are all misleading the country that he alone is right and that all these organisations are out of step with the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many of the old age pensioners returned to the community go back to homes where they live alone and where they will not be looked after <e> <s> is it not possible for the hospital concerned to inform local authorities of old age pensioners being returned to the community so that those living alone can be looked after <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord understand that many women who work in this and the other place do not receive any party whip <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his statement on the security of jobs for the future of that great industry is very much welcomed on all sides of the house <e> <s> however regarding defence is he aware that the royal navy the army and the royal air force will depend a great deal on nuclear power <e> <s> would it not be right and proper that there should be the safeguard of having that industry in the hands of the people and the british parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no speakers in this house to order me to sit down <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister to take into very serious account the points made by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale which have been previously made by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> those points were that due to the importance of bills that later become acts those bills should be reasonably understandable by the ordinary public <e> <s> it might be a very good idea to have people who are not lawyers examining some of the bills because they could make suggestions which ordinary people would make if they were given that opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that encouraging reply <e> <s> will he also accept that that formality ought not to be too long in coming and that perhaps we might even surpass the agreement initiated by the soviet union and the usa in starting real negotiations about nuclear weapons <e> <s> perhaps we in this country may now give the lead in getting reductions of the type indicated in my question <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that one of the fundamental issues which should encourage formality in discussions with the soviet union and the warsaw pact is the very fact that on the nuclear element there was such remarkable agreement apropos verification <e> <s> in my judgment verification is fundamental and perhaps with the accuracy which now exists we should stride forth and try to get some agreement with regard to conventional weapons with the same element of checking and verification as was in the nuclear agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be possible to increase the number of police officers and vehicles on the motorways <e> <s> i am sure that all members of the house and the minister will agree that the very appearance of a police officer in his vehicle on a motorway or on a major road has a dramatic and worthwhile effect irrespective of whether drivers are drunk <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply and i wish the government well in all their endeavours <e> <s> but the government must be a bit more decisive <e> <s> the situation now in the middle east is highly explosive <e> <s> we have seen the contemptible treatment of the deputy secretary-general of the united nations the organisation which created israel <e> <s> the minister will i think agree that his treatment has been contemptible <e> <s> we know of the appalling situation in that country <e> <s> in view of all those things accepting that the government have done pretty well in trying to get an international conference will the minister make contact with the united states the soviet union and leading members of the security council to ensure that what they wish to see achieved is achieved as quickly as possible and so prevent an even more explosive situation being created <e>", "<cs> my lords if as the minister has quite correctly said the same rights apply to the arabs in the occupied territories as to the israelis as created by the united nations does it not therefore follow that at some time the israelis must withdraw from the lands they stole and give them back to those from whom they took them <e> <s> before that happens we must concentrate would not the minister agree on trying to get the international conference that he has called for <e> <s> will the government now appeal to the great powers on this earth as well as to israel and arab lands to get together before something really dreadful happens which could possibly engulf that entire area in a fearful war <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that notwithstanding the possibility of unemployment figures being cooked the main factor is that they are far too high <e> <s> does he agree that there is a possibility that high unemployment figures may be related to the problems of inner cities and the rise in criminal activity throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put two short questions to the noble earl <e> <s> on the very valid point made by his colleague a few moments ago about the economic sector being vitally important is he aware that one of the difficulties is the fact that for the past four to five years we have had about to million unemployed <e> <s> that is an expense for which part of the <e> <s> health service is now paying <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the leader of the house aware that that is a most remarkable answer to my question bearing in mind that on th december the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the leader of the house aware that many hundreds if not thousands of civil servants are now of the opinion that the government have certain standards for what they call important confidential reports made to ministers <e> <s> some civil servants have been hauled before the courts-they were freed

<s> in other situations a person is harrassed even if there is grave doubt <e> <s> there is no doubt about the supplementary question which i put is the leader of the house prepared to take that matter very seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the leader of the house whether he would be prepared at some time as i am sure he takes this matter extremely seriously to consider coming to the house to make a further statement <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the proposition is well worth examining <e> <s> is he not aware that the bbcs world service is listened to by very many countries in and outside the commonwealth and that it does great service <e> <s> a television network of this calibre would enhance the spirit of freedom everywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that like many other professions engineers and those engaged in engineering technology are going to depend a great deal upon computers <e> <s> it is engineers who train engineers and architects who train architects therefore ought it not now to be the policy of the government that computer experts should train computer students <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> can he say whether the government are satisfied with the level of intelligence co-operation in

bases from which these very venomous attacks are made on naval and civil shipping causing so much damage <e>", "<cs> my lords the question was when are they going to make up what they call a mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has said that there has been a remarkable degree of growth and the economy has been responding over the past two years but that growth may lessen in the year ahead <e> <s> despite the good growth there has been a serious diminution in the resources that our national health service requires <e> <s> does that mean that the cuts that were imposed when we had reasonably good growth will be worse if that growth declines and that the nhs is in danger <e>", "<cs> my lords we should congratulate the minister on his patience in anticipating the supplementary question of his noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that something must be done speedily to stop the situation where british babies die while they are in the queue waiting for

japanese government who will in no way listen to the appeals of the united states of america our allies or the british government <e> <s> is it not about time that a british government and a united states government made joint representations to the japanese and asked them whether they will make every endeavour to be honest and truthful <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very hard to get that tiny concession from the japanese <e> <s> it is about time that the americans and the british asserted themselves and the dignity of both nations <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister nevertheless agree

past that is not necessarily their fault <e> <s> the duty of the government is not to see how many people can receive hospitalisation at any one time but to ensure as the original act says that

by all governments as the minister rightly said <e> <s> however will he state quite clearly for the professional people in the national health service that at all times the government accept full responsibility for maintaining the efficiency and general strategy of britains national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that the governments policy is to destroy the largest education authority in great britain <e> <s> ought not such a proposal be subjected to all the procedures of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether it is the

"<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> does he agree that the secretary of state should have included representatives of the chartered society of physiotherapy <e> <s> will he please explain to the house how what he has just said lines up with the statements made today in the british press that the chancellor of the exchequer is not prepared to provide one halfpenny for the national health service <e> <s> if that is so where are the improvements coming from <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that it has become obvious over the past few months that

whitley councils be fed through to the organisations which i am proposing which would be a kind of cabinet of the health service to assist the government <e> <s> why do the government always seem to be keen to put up a difficulty to every solution <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that if the proposition put forward by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is made a reality it will mean tax relief for the comfortably off and much more worry for the sick who cannot get an improved national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree as has been stated that there may be little possibility of genuine competition that if we move too swiftly there may be very serious deleterious effects on a great industry and that the repercussions could affect almost all of british industry <e> <s> therefore should not the government for purely doctrinaire reasons take great care in what they do with this countrys electricity industry <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the government are contemplating introducing specialist computer training at all levels of education to meet the very obvious demands in the next decade for first-class computer experts in the construction industry <e>", "<cs> my lords when the powers of the council have been finalised by the home secretary and those advising him will there be some opportunity for us to examine the important powers which this urgently-needed council will then possess <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the point made by my noble friend lord underhill concerning beacons being destroyed may i point out that there is also the growing habit of motorists parking on the zig-zag lines <e> <s> as a result the official safe crossing becomes a greater hazard than any other part of the road which has no zebra crossing <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his statement that the government no longer desire to interfere with local government will bring great relief to many of those authorities who thought that they might have to suffer what ilea and other authorities have suffered <e> <s> is he also aware that whether it is a question of single or family homeless it is a blight on our nation <e> <s> what irritates and annoys many people is the fact that there is a vast amount of single and family homelessness and yet at the same time we have a ridiculous level of unemployment in the construction industry <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister whether or not the government would be prepared to accept that the endeavours of mr gorbachev ought to he matched by the usa and pakistan <e>", "<cs> my lords it may not be very important to us but we have to realise that in point of fact the soviet union was invited into afghanistan by a communist

trade union movement <e> <s> many trade unions the french the belgian and the german based themselves on the british trade union movement <e> <s> i for one am very proud of the fact that it was the british trade union movement that faced up to that challenge <e>", "<cs> in a moment i have a few things to say first <e> <s> in a few moments the noble lord will be much more angry even than he is now <e> <s> i want to say this <e> <s> i want it to be quite clear when the minister replies that he will acknowledge that there are bands of britons british men and women who may not feel too safe with any trade union movement at present but who band themselves together without calling themselves a trade union and that if they take any action whatsoever to ensure that their point of view is fully understood by their employers and the people of this country then those people will in no way be harassed by a bill which refers to trade unions or trade unionists <e> <s> the minister must acknowledge that there will be complete and total freedom for those people to take whatever industrial action they like without being harassed by the provisions of this bill <e> <s> i hope that when he replies he will make that transparently clear <e>", "<cs> of course it was the case <e> <s> the nazis lied about everything <e> <s> even their title was a lie was it not <e> <s> they lied about my

relatives of those who are dying in them will have to put up with it <e> <s> if they have to close the cost to the national health service will be infinitely higher than if the government take courage

obtain such assistance if they charge the patients <e> <s> we are concerned with the hospices which do this work voluntarily but which are nonetheless pleased that the nurses have received the pay award <e> <s> therefore when he said that he will look thoroughly into the matter it was indeed a most welcome reply <e>", "<cs> my lords will the house be provided with an opportunity to examine the review when it is published <e> <s> will the review include not only nurses and doctors but hospital ancillary and support staff who are important as has been acknowledged by cohse the bma and the royal college of nursing <e> <s> they firmly believe that ancillary and <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister convey to his right honourable friend the need for proper and exacting qualifications for chiropodists <e> <s> there are many problems facing britains foot hospitals such as the london foot hospital in fitzroy square <e> <s> if these matters are not in the review can the minister help the chiropodists by seeing that they are put in the review <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the point made by the minister about the statement made by a presidential candidate <e> <s> i believe that the governments attitude on that point is correct <e> <s> exceedingly important statements have been made on star wars by the president of the united states and by mr gorbachev <e> <s> does the minister agree therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> does the minister agree that the science of verification must be at the heart of every disarmament treaty <e> <s> we are all involved <e> <s> it appears that since december when there were discussions regarding the inf treaty between mr gorbachev and president reagan the americans have arrived at what they call an open regime verification for the inf treaty <e> <s> we were not involved in that <e> <s> other nato countries were not involved <e> <s> we do not have any information about the involvement of the warsaw pact countries <e> <s> does the minister believe that we should become more closely involved on the vital issue of verification <e> <s> without complete and foolproof verification no disarmament treaty will be worth a light <e>", "<cs> my lords does verification extend as i believe it ought to all forms of underground tests and also to weapons which are not nuclear but which can with modification become nuclear weapons almost immediately <e> <s> are they included in full and comprehensive verification <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government prepared to talk with our allies as regards possible cheating on verification tests <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the office of fair trading can help no one who has purchased a car from abroad in getting spare parts or even getting repairs effected <e> <s> it offers no help whatsoever and has said so in writing in particular to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a very good example <e> <s> what is wrong with me

ensure that that evil practice is wiped out everywhere thus maintaining the principle subscribed to by successive british governments <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it would be worthwhile talking to officials and people who are well known in the world of both rugby league and rugby union because it seems that rugby does not have this problem <e> <s> rugby matches bring out the same fervour and massive support but very little violence <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister merely saying what he thinks london transport means when it says that all these areas which control the <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister may have mentioned this but in case i have not heard correctly will he say whether in the programme serious consideration will be given to the accommodation for staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply but is he aware that the latin american countries involved are about six times the size of europe <e> <s> people with detailed and intimate knowledge of those countries take the view that the government and indeed private endeavour are not doing enough <e> <s> they say that there is a vast amount of good will towards the british in those latin american countries and that it would enhance our reputation if we had more people who could speak spanish <e> <s> if those two matters were put together britain could only improve its trade and general relationship with latin america <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in addition to the dti and the foreign office there are other well-known organisations in britain

knowledge which would assist businessmen and perhaps the departments mentioned by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the top flight specialists and scientists who have issued this warning <e>

appropriate action can be taken just in case we might be very deliberately poisoning people in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that verification of all agreements is still vital to us vital to our allies and vital possibly also to the ussr <e> <s> does he not also agree that since the end of the last war there has been bitterness suspicion and all kinds of ugly reactions on all sides of the so-called iron curtain and now for the first time there seems to be a genuine change of attitude <e> <s> should not the government continue as they have been doing up to now to encourage that change of attitude so that if we can improve on our relations we shall not refer to any other country as far as is humanly possible as the enemy <e> <s> we refer to the russians

regions <e> <s> if when the issues were discussed with the regional health authorities all the regions gave the same answers as those given by the minister this afternoon there would not be a great amount of anxiety <e> <s> will the minister please be good enough to look into that aspect of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> there seems a distinct possibility of a ceasefire and an armistice in the iran-iraq war <e> <s> united nations resolution has been in existence for one year <e> <s> tens of thousands of people have died civilians and people in armies and air forces but the united nations appears to have done very little <e> <s> does not the minister agree therefore that if a ceasefire is brought about there should be special representation with regard to the future of prisoners on both sides <e> <s> does not the minister further agree that when this part of the gulf war is over there should be a full endeavour to resolve the dispute between israel and the lands that israel occupies with particular reference to the palestinian refugees <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that international conferences through the united nations have never been particularly fruitful <e> <s> the endeavour of my original question was to suggest to the government who have done so much and given a good lead in establishing some form of connection and discussions with people that we should rely on our powerful allies and not necessarily the united nations in an endeavour to stop the squalid war that is continuing between palestinians in their own country and the forces of israel which are occupying that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that reply which contained a degree of encouragement <e> <s> however is the noble viscount not aware that the threat of serious explosion can be contained <e> <s> for example experts have pointed out that on the brent alpha platform miles further north and hours earlier a similar accident took place but because of the efficiency of the system which had been properly maintained the explosion was not nearly such a disaster as that

is the noble viscount also prepared to accept that the siting of the crews living accommodation on the alpha piper platform whoever brought that about was also a disaster <e> <s> according to the experts the accommodation should never have been placedthere <e> <s> does the noble viscount therefore agree that constant testing of the central control system is necessary and that nothing trivial should be overlooked to prevent any such disaster in the future <e> <s> i thank the minister for his replies and the government for their endeavours <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not perplexing that long before these appalling delays occurred which are irritating and indeed sometimes harmful no excuse could be advanced because of the lateness of computers as computers did not exist and remarkably enough nor did the problems about which the noble baroness has been talking <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the cause of the strike was the failure of the management to attract staff in areas which badly needed them <e> <s> moreover does the minister also agree that it might have been wise for the management to confer with the unions involved in order to try to find a solution and thus avoid a strike <e> <s> the strike was caused by myopic arrogance <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there was serious myopia on the part of management who acted in an arrogant manner and that the strike was not the fault of the unions <e> <s> is he also aware that if there had been consultations there might well not have been a strike <e> <s> on behalf of all of us will he try to see the management of the post office to ask that in future when there are problems of this nature normal civilised british joint negotiations take place <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to the point made by the noble lord lord broxbourne does the minister agree that it might be helpful if at all levels of local government it were known who owns land in the area <e> <s> does he accept that

requires <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact of the matter is that the economy of the country was not under control and that is why we had to have an increase in mortage rates <e> <s> the chancellor of the exchequer made some serious errors but notwithstanding the fact <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding the fact that inflation must be countered and held down does the minister not agree that the present method of high interest rates hurts and harms one sector of the british economy those who are trying to buy their own homes <e> <s> not only is the agony of repossession a possibility but there is the fact that they more than others find the biggest burden that of meeting their mortgage payments <e> <s> that they will do at all costs yet for trying to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords for

briefly outline what they are <e>", "<cs> my lords it has never been really tested <e> <s> all i am asking as have other members on all sides of the house is whether the government will consider the proposition to see whether it can be accepted in the united nations <e> <s> such an arrangement should save the lives of literally millions of men women and children caught by these disasters <e> <s> speed is of the absolute essence for any aid that is forthcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> what he has just said reflects great credit on both sides of the negotiating table <e> <s> why then does the secretary of state refrain from continuing those discussions with the professional leaders involving issues such as funding clinical grading appeals

visitors and midwives especially on the issue of clincial grading which i mentioned <e> <s> the fundamental steps have been taken <e> <s> they now want to sit around the table <e> <s> is that a

of state that he would be helping all britains nurses if he were to talk to their professional leaders <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that although the kurdish people have suffered appallingly they are not the only people suffering as refugees <e> <s> the number of refugees created in the past five or six years all over the world is desperate <e> <s> will the government be prepared to assist the secretary-general of the united nations to create an investigating force which would examine the atrocities being committed in some parts of israel by israeli people and in some parts of the arab land on the west bank with people punishing others for nothing <e> <s> perhaps we ought to take a firmer stand and bring this item more forcefully to the agenda of the united nations

points <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords reference was made to no-strike agreements <e> <s> will the noble lord not agree that the unions at gchq offered the government a no-strike agreement

kingdom <e> <s> the time will come when veterinary surgeons from europe and the ec will dominate our agricultural areas <e> <s> it is vital that we keep pace in producing vets from our universities to

lords perhaps i may say that i agree with the last words uttered by the noble lord <e> <s> however will he consider the proposition that in the national interest our armed forces should have full-time intelligence officers and not as at present many part-timers who interfere in parts of the political setup which is not their concern <e> <s> furthermore is not the time approaching when all those

<e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that what we have to try to achieve is to remove altogether any possible risk of a nuclear war and to do that we might continue exerting pressure on

services are somewhat concerned at the governments proposals <e> <s> is it not possible for the government to examine those concerns and then examine their own proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the national federation of building trade employers and the trade unions are of the opinion that a concerted assault on the growing shortage of housing in great britain would resolve the problem <e> <s> that would assist the employers and the trade unions to carry out many of the schemes that they have in mind but have not yet been able to carry out because they are not

says that she is not aware so i shall have to inform her of the concerns of britains veterinary surgeons <e> <s> is she aware that in the run-up to the completion of the internal market there has been a dramatic increase in the number of vets coming here from other countries <e> <s> british vets are very anxious about the rumour that the findings of the riley report may lead to the closure of two

allowed to be shaken out by anyone at any time <e> <s> could another phrase not be found <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl able to give an answer as to the approximate number of houses that will be sold <e> <s> he could not give the answer to the vital question regarding the increase of homelessness as to the number of houses that will be built by local authorities <e> <s> does he not accept that it would be wrong for houses to be sold to those who can afford to buy them when those who can hardly pay the rent of the house have to go homeless <e> <s> is that not a pretty hopeless situation for quite a number of people in our nation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that many of the colleges of the university of wales are concerned about this matter <e> <s> will he ask his right honourable friend whether he will be gracious enough to get in touch with the vice-chancellor of the university of wales to see whether some help and provision can be provided along the lines

encouraged <e> <s> is he also aware that over the past nine to years in many parts of the country particularly in wales there has been growing disquiet at the proportion of members of the conservative party in the health authorities which has increased year by year <e> <s> that has resulted in a loss of balance and undoubtedly a loss of talent to the nhs <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to the noble earls reply to the noble baroness lady robson and his first answer to my question is he aware that if that theory was put into practice there would not be grave disquiet throughout the country about the continued excessive appointment of members of the conservative party to these bodies <e> <s> this disquiet is so grave that i ask the noble earl to at least convey those feelings to the secretary of state for examination <e> <s> the theory outlined by the minister is supported by all but the theory has nothing whatever to do with what is going on in practice and which is favouring the conservative party <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not a very comforting answer to my question which was will the government stop any price increases for water <e> <s> it is that which is frightening people <e> <s> is the minister aware that specialists on the subject both those who support privatisation and those who are opposed to it are agreed on one issue <e> <s> it is that the government are

water companies are expected to effect significant increases in their prices in a few months time <e>", "<cs> my lords if this were simply a political issue many of us would wish the government to continue because per cent <e> <s> of the members of the public who participate in the polls and radiophone-ins are against this entire measure <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers reply was very welcome but will it not also be possible for the government to help when children visit farms and to ask farmers to point out the extremely valuable contribution made to their profession by the british veterinary association and british veterinary surgeons so that children understand the value of british vets in british society <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government consulted and if not will they consult the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals on this subject because the society has some very definite views on the matter based on its great knowledge of such problems <e>",

regarding costs i am sure we realise that per cent <e> <s> of the pay rises for teachers and doctors is equivalent to the entire amount of money spent on veterinary education and that the ufc itself spends more money on biologists who fail than on the veterinary surgeons who pass <e> <s> that is not merely absurd it is causing great chagrin and annoyance in the veterinary world among experienced

<e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not agree that perhaps for security reasons alone there could be improved liaison in training between immigration officers and customs officers <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the daily habitual maiming and slaying of palestinian youths causes as much grave concern to the israeli people as it obviously does to the palestinians <e> <s> is it not terrible to have to say that the worlds international organisations can do nothing to stop the appalling slaughter that is going on in israel and the occupied territories <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that since the idea of an international conference was agreed upon by everyone except israel palestinian youths have been slain <e> <s> surely that cannot go on <e> <s> should

lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that i can agree with quite a lot of what he has said and with some of the criticisms he has made but it behoves us to bear in mind that in the early s

the legislation introduced by aneurin bevan enabled us to accomplish a great deal in housing i hope that this will not be considered an offence british ex-servicemen who fought in the british army the royal navy and the royal air force <e> <s> some of us ran into debt in our councils in providing homes for those ex-servicemen and their young children <e> <s> that was one of the greatest achievements of local government <e> <s> perhaps i may conclude by saying that if local government everywhere could emulate the behaviour of local authorities throughout the country labour and

after month in this house and in another place <e> <s> is he also aware that the statement will nevertheless be regarded by the royal british legion and the general public as a very good start but not the end of the matter <e> <s> will he ask his right honourable friend whether it would be possible for the implementation of the increase to be speeded up so that the widows do not have to wait until

this government prevent an attempt to settle a dispute which could be resolved by acas <e> <s> therefore is it not time that they changed their wretched policy <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that the obstinacy of the government has proved to be extremely expensive <e> <s> they have now spent million on employing police to undertake extra work whereas million would have resolved the dispute <e> <s> how stupid can the government get <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister prepared to consider the fact that when british television companies broadcast their weather forecasts the forecaster sometimes brushes his hand over an area representing or square miles and people are not always quite sure about which area he is talking <e> <s> therefore would it not be possible for them to illustrate the different parts of the country and the weather that is affecting them by indicating the number of towns involved for example by mentioning edinburgh glasgow newcastle birmingham and cardiff as well as london <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount tell the house whether there have been any arrests by the police of those people who march on our streets calling for the murder of mr rushdie <e> <s> is that not a criminal offence <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister made his flattering remarks about the judges of england was he not aware that there are some judges who have made rude remarks about their superiors and have had to be brought to heel because of their vulgar behaviour <e> <s> will the minister exclude those judges from his generous remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that this problem is not merely confined to london but is stretching out to major cities throughout the country <e> <s> is he not therefore prepared to seek consultation with the police who know a great deal about this matter and with the salvation army and the social services of local authorities <e> <s> they together could paint the full picture which would then enable the government to take appropriate action <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many people in the know are of the opinion that there is not enough co-operation and exchange of intelligence on this subject <e> <s> do her majestys government feel that it might be possible to increase the degree of co-operation now lacking <e> <s> that could make a big contribution to the fight against this venomous problem <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that both the general public and the ordinary staff on the underground realise that its present system of administration and performance is redolent of the augean stables <e> <s> when one speaks and complains to the ordinary men who run the trains and to the inspectors who keep them going they say that the fault lies in the administrative headquarters at st jamess <e> <s> when one asks them why they make a special broadcast just as a train came roaring into a station so that everyone has to listen hard to what is going on they say that the people who run the system have never been down there in their lives <e> <s> those people complain about the hold-ups on the way home in their rolls-royces <e> <s> instead of bothering with the people at st jamess is it not about time for a conference to be held of the ordinary men and women who represent the public the guards and the signallers on london underground so that they may give their advice and make recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that all the matters that we are discussing are not the responsibility of the people who operate the underground <e> <s> they are the responsibility of those who are right at the top <e> <s> until they are made accountable for the salaries that they earn one can understand why the staff are now losing their morale <e> <s> they do not want it <e> <s> they are proud to work for london underground <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the chairman of london transport will call together representatives of the workers under his control who actually operate the system and listen to their points of view <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect that does not answer the kernel of my question <e> <s> will all tenants be free from being cheated by landlords to whom they now pay rates in with their rent and will they have to continue to pay rates to the landlord as well as the poll tax to the local authority <e> <s> will that be regarded as criminal behaviour on the part of those landlords <e> <s> can we have a straight answer and not one about publications <e> <s> can we have a yes or no on behalf of the millions of people who are so threatened <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that tenants of private landlords who have to pay rates have also to pay the poll tax <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say what percentage of the figures that he gave to the house relate to former council tenants who are trying to buy their houses and are unable now to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the point of spreading misery <e> <s> these people are weak and poor <e> <s> why create more misery by having increases in mortgage rates with all the worries that that is bringing to ordinary people <e> <s> all the government seem to be concentrating on is making everybody weak poor and upset <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her detailed reply <e> <s> is she aware that the veterinary profession realises that the page report on <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the british veterinary association and the royal college hope that there will be no discrimination in fees <e> <s> will the government also note that the threatened closure of the glasgow and cambridge schools caused a blight on the veterinary profession resulting in great anxiety and that it is hoped that that situation will never occur again <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that the matter to which she has just referred will be strongly challenged and denied by the british veterinary association and the royal college <e>", "<cs> my lords can the department also look at the position of male nurses employed in such establishments for the mentally disturbed both from a legal point of view and their terms of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord said <e> <s> i now have to decide between what he has just said and what the royal college of nursing and the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists said <e> <s> and there is the recent episode in guys hospital <e> <s> perhaps it may help if i read out a statement made by professor harry keen of guys hospital which was widely reported <e>", "<cs> what is wrong with being professor harry keen <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been in parliament for a quarter of a century and that is the most distasteful and disgusting statement that i have ever heard <e> <s> if anyone in my party were to say he has been a member of the tory party it would be a shameful thing to say <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord has been elected to any office in this parliament but i have never heard any noble lord say to me that something said is invalid because he is a member of the labour party or the sdp or a liberal a member of any party <e> <s> i have not heard that said before in a very long time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly say that i have received a note from the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that the trade unions involved raised this matter urgently within the past few months <e> <s> it is absolutely the responsibility of management within the post office which should listen more earnestly to the protestations and advice given by the trade unions <e>",

re-examine the entire situation so that the ultimate legislation will be acceptable to the british people as a whole and not merely to stalwarts of the conservative party <e>", "<cs> i hope that when the noble earl replies to the points that have been made by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister this question <e> <s> what representations were made before and immediately after the arrest of these people and during the so-called trial <e> <s> there was no democratic trial whatever but a totalitarian trial by military men who had to do what they were told <e> <s> they were probably instructed to find those people guilty and no doubt to say what the sentences were <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in his reply to the noble lord lord nugent he appeared to imply that one of the answers might be for british rail to grant itself a loan <e> <s> that does not seem possible <e> <s> is not the only real answer that british rail must be helped as a public service and must be publicly assisted by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords will it be worthwhile having discussions with the representatives of the clubs at all levels of rugby union including the international level <e> <s> they do not seem to have any problem whatsoever and they might be able to give some guidance to professional soccer <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether or not the government agree that the selling of cemeteries for a few pence by westminster city council has become a national issue <e> <s> do her majestys government give their blessing to that form of transaction which has irritated people throughout the entire nation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say in regard to this touching problem of our youth whether there is liaison between the home office various police officers and parts of local government which are affected <e> <s> do these three meet at any time to try to resolve this disturbing problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> however is he also aware that the feature known as barrier jumping has increased enormously and that the use of plastic travel cards has been abused by cheats hiring them out or through cheats finding lost cards and using them <e> <s> if these matters were dealt with the financial situation of london underground could be even better <e> <s> furthermore would it not be wise to reinstate the travelling ticket inspectors who achieved so much as regards catching cheats and saving money for london transport <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister convey to his right honourable friend in another place the fact that travelling ticket inspectors not only sorted out cheats but were also useful officers to assist passengers in an emergency <e> <s> they also helped in the administration of london transport <e> <s> many people feel that the travelling ticket inspectors should be reinstated <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the figures she has given do not mean much to dental surgeons and other practitioners involved in dentistry <e> <s> they are concerned about the long-term effects and what will happen to people who should have visited the dentist three years ago to have their teeth examined but who have not bothered because of the charges <e> <s> is the minister prepared to consider that aspect of the matter as well <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that she has not answered my question <e> <s> will she please consider speaking to the british dental association in order to get the facts straight so that the right action can be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords what were the guidelines and what has yet to be achieved for the government to be able to say that the time is now right <e> <s> what must happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am almost tempted to congratulate the noble baroness on that reply <e> <s> it appears that the government intend to consider no alternative to what is regarded in academic circles as the most vicious and unjust scheme ever produced in academic history <e> <s> that view is shared by many members on both sides of this house <e> <s> however i am not so much interested in the future of the tory party as in the future of education in this country <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that this measure constitutes a grave threat to higher education and to staff and students and that the scheme will not in any way save any money but will only cause grave embarrassment to students their parents and the staff of our universities <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that i was in this chamber and listened to the notable speeches of the noble lords lord beloff and lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> those speeches were approved of by university staff and students <e> <s> can the noble baroness say what is the governments estimate of the cost of all of this which is going to disrupt higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords my last question was fundamental <e> <s> will the noble baroness tell the house and the country the cost of the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain the procedures which in a few months turned the thames which years ago was one of the dirtiest rivers into the cleanest river in europe <e> <s> why cannot that process be applied to all of our rivers so that other countries can emulate our good behaviour <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that it must primarily be a matter for the unions and the employers <e> <s> the public at large are shocked and shattered by terrible accidents but they do not know the cause and they never intend to find it out <e> <s> what the noble lord lord marsh has suggested is quite ludicrous <e> <s> it is the unions and the employers

supplementary question of the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> he said that it was apparently irrelevant to the question on the order paper <e> <s> did not the noble lords question relate to the governments environmental policy in regard to preserving certain parts of the land <e> <s> does he agree that what the noble lord said is strictly relevant to that part of the question in which we are all interested <e>", "<cs> my lords i was referring to the question of the noble lord lord hunt <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has said that the views of the local authorities will be taken into consideration by the department <e> <s> will the views of the many voluntary organisations concerned with this aspect of education be taken into consideration together with those of representatives of the teachers associations <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that there could be a follow-up of verification for the gradual abandonment of chemical weapons <e> <s> will that verification include on-the-spot physical examination and therefore reduce the possibility of cheating to nil <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply but is she aware that many universities are in worrying if not desperate straits <e> <s> i give the example of london university which is already short on each student <e> <s> the council of the university which selects new intakes i hope the noble baroness will take full cognisance of this can take only of the applications for the legal faculty <e> <s> does not the noble baroness agree that that is a matter which should be investigated and put right <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding her initial reply is the noble baroness aware that many universities are genuinely anxious and upset <e> <s> therefore rather than making absurd criticism of what is happening but at the same avoiding the need to wait for questions and answers or debates would it not be better if data were to be submitted to the department which can be examined <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to congratulate the noble earl lord clanwilliam on a very interesting maiden speech and also the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh who made a formidable maiden contribution highly interesting informative and classic in its own right <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house whether the department still maintains close liaison with the british veterinary association on this and similar problems <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister gave an interesting reply to my noble friend lord glenamara <e> <s> he said that the matter should be referred to his right honourable friend on behalf of english ratepayers <e> <s> when that is done will the minister come back and tell the house what views and what action his right honourable friend intends to take on the question submitted by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> however can he say whether the government will continue with the policy of high interest rates and bank of england intervention to buck the market or will they float the pound in order to join the exchange rate mechanism <e> <s> can we have a definition as to which of those policies they intend to adopt <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl not aware that a continued policy of high interest rates punishes very savagely millions of british people who are trying to buy their own homes including those who were encouraged to buy their council houses but who are now having to leave them because they cannot pay the high mortgages <e> <s> in view of these factors together with the harm that is being done to british industry does the minister not agree that it is about time that the government reviewed a policy which continues to harass home purchasers and certain parts of the british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords when the governments words are put into practice it will become singularly obvious that the community care provisions will be inadequate <e> <s> the blind crippled and mentally ill will suffer <e> <s> will the government reconsider their position so that ordinary folk do not suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many families particularly large families will find themselves in extremely difficult financial circumstances whether the boroughs in which they live are capped or not <e> <s> have the government anything in mind to help these families who will be in difficult financial circumstances when the poll tax gets under way <e> <s> will some help be provided at least to alleviate their suffering <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the quite considerable discrepancies in figures that have been referred to by noble lords on this side of the house and which the noble viscount has found unacceptable and bearing in mind the statement that has just been made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter would it not be reasonable for the noble viscount to ask his right honourable friend to issue a statement so that the house can have some idea of the real position <e> <s> at this moment in time we do not know what the position is and i believe the house is entitled to know that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness said that the government would like to see parents sending their children to the school of their choice <e> <s> where that choice may be inhibited or prevented by lack of funds for travel or fees do the government intend to help such parents who wish to make a choice but who will need extra money to fulfil it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that the government lay greater emphasis on saving money and reducing costs than on reducing the massive number of homeless families in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl may have mentioned this point but i should like to be certain about it <e> <s> will representatives of the prison officers association give evidence to the inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness said that she disagreed profoundly with everything that my noble friend lord glenamara said notwithstanding that his massive knowledge of this industry leaves her making a tiny contribution <e> <s> will she try to tell the house when the government will say to the teachers of this country we shall now meet your representatives and bring back the rights that you had in negotiating your terms of employment and your salaries <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the frustration of the travelling public on londons underground in particular and bearing in mind the question of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter would it not be helpful if the director of london regional transport stopped travelling on londons underground and buses <e>", "<cs> my lords although it might be right for british rail to discuss that one particular issue with officials of the city of oxford has it also had discussions with the very able representatives of the organisations for the disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that that is hardly a satisfactory answer when one realises that the chancellor has expressed grave doubts about the figure and terminology such as the noble earl has used <e> <s> should we believe the answer that we have just heard or should we join with the chancellor in expressing grave doubts about such figures <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble earl agree that this so-called fight against inflation has brought the most sordid misery to tens of thousands of ordinary folk who are trying to buy their homes as well as having many other effects <e> <s> is it not possible for the central statistical office to examine what has happened with regard to the pound and its comparison with the deutschmark and the dollar <e> <s> if it cannot give a definite answer why does it exist <e> <s> is it because it was unreliable that the chancellor decided to take that office under his own wing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has obviously not answered the question <e> <s> the central statistical office has now been taken over more or less by the chancellor himself <e> <s> cannot the noble earl refer this question to that office and then write to me <e> <s> a copy of the letter could then be placed in the library for all noble lords to examine <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that many of us can remember the events of that time perhaps i may say this <e> <s> we are not so concerned with the government of the soviet union in the years until but with the tremendous effort the soviet people made in support of us <e> <s> the support that we had from america and the soviet union contributed to the destruction of nazi germany <e> <s> bearing in mind that mr gorbachev has softened his sanctions encouraged by president bush ought we not to recognise that and

the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> it seems to indicate that the government are very well aware that those countries that will comprise the single european market in have very little concern for

serious situation and abominable cruelty to horses will continue <e> <s> i hope that the government will fight hard to see that ec regulations are improved so that they are in line with our animal health act <e>", "<cs> my lords the international league for the protection of horses is quite prepared to make its vast knowledge and experience available to the department so that it will have a superb case to present for our fundamental principles act of to be adopted <e> <s> can the minister say whether the department is prepared to consider that offer <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord explain in a little more detail how the government will encourage british recruitment to the commission <e> <s> how will people know how and where to apply in order to be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that nations which have had their people taken as hostages as we have and countries that hold hostages or influence the holding of hostages must now make an ultimate endeavour to ensure that talks take place with the object <e>", "<cs> my lords does not this flurry of figures constitute a hopelessly inadequate reply to a question about the chronic shortage of nurses in the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness be kind enough to consider contacting the royal college of nursing the confederation of health service employees and the royal colleges of physicians and of surgeons to seek their views on what they feel is a chronic situation as regards the shortage of nurses <e> <s> i think that is a fair proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords we have seen an ever-increasing amount of homelessness and the growth in our cities of those appalling cardboard sectors in which people live <e> <s> when do the government intend to do something to deal with the problem and set about creating a housing programme so that such people can be housed <e> <s> in the meantime will they encourage all voluntary organisations which are prepared to give of their best to counter the hopelessness of the homeless in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been articles in the newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government considered a possible alternative to raising mortgage rates to astronomical levels which causes great unhappiness and homelessness with the excuse that they are combating inflation <e> <s> why should they deliberately create homelessness and anxiety among people who can no longer afford the houses which they began to purchase a few years ago with the excuse that there is no other solution to bringing down inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the cbi has indicated its support for wage restraint and says that managers and directors should not pay themselves more in dividends and salaries than they earn in other words it cuts all ways <e> <s> do the government agree with that principle <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that whenever the government make a statement about inflation they refer

the one hand and call for <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government also take into account i am sure they will the fact that some of the giant airlines of the united states have been severely criticised for their attitude towards security in recent times <e> <s> will the government ensure i am sure they will that such matters of security will be taken into account as regards any changes in the airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount not agree that the entire nation considers this an extremely important issue which we should not allow to be reduced to a cheap level of political point-making <e>", "<cs> my lords it is good that there should be international co-operation <e> <s> however i should like to raise a matter referred to by the noble and gallant lord lord carver <e> <s> as regards our forces are the government satisfied with some of the intricate legal aspects of such co-operation that may arise from time to time some aspects of which may embarrass our

government do to try to stop the loss of that steelworks and of so many skilled jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of their highly commendable action have the government decided to raise those issues

that reply and the degree of encouragement indicating that he recognises that there is a need to ensure that existing legislation is made effective <e> <s> is he aware that there are roughly stray dogs in this country that we put down a day humanely and that tens of thousands suffer appallingly <e> <s> evidence as to that can be given by the british veterinary association the peoples <e>",

minister aware that the majority of our royal colleges probably know more about the nhs than any of us that many price increases have been met to a degree by the government but that other aspects of the nhs are being neglected that schemes have been introduced which are deleterious to the nhs and that we are arriving at the worst possible world <e> <s> the nhs is costing us more and it is not nearly as efficient as it was years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that what he has just said which i hope is on the record is the opposite of views

the noble lord aware that recently the institute of economic affairs conducted a poll among economists who published a report condemning the governments present economic policy particularly as regards deliberately creating high interest rates higher mortgage rates and higher rents <e> <s> does not the minister agree that economists cannot be wrong and that the institute of economic affairs is a responsible body <e> <s> i hope he will agree that the findings of that report are a serious matter for all of us including the government <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be possible for the government at least to consider having talks with the larger district councils the metropolitan boroughs and the london boroughs to see what can be done to improve standards of public transport and so make a

satisfied with a part-time job <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that those who use the motorways a great deal are aware of one remarkable situation <e> <s> one is aware that speeds are being excessively abused suddenly a police car appears and every vehicle slows down <e> <s> would it not be possible for the government to inquire of a cross-section of chief constables whose areas include the great motorways whether it would be of any help to have more police vehicles on the road as their presence acts as a deterrent to anyone intending to break the law <e>", "<cs> my lords from what the noble earl said i was under the impression that we should make a contribution and move over to allow those who want to break the law in this island to do so <e> <s> did he really mean that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> the threat to the warsaw pact has rapidly diminished and that must call for a restructuring of uk defence and possibly through the s will lead to substantial savings <e> <s> could those savings be used to assist industry in research particularly in science and technology for the benefit not only of defence but all aspects of british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that the break up of the warsaw pact treaty countries is a very realistic state of affairs and something that we should welcome <e> <s> therefore does he further agree that there is bound to be a need for some restructuring among our nato allies <e> <s> when that subject is being discussed will the minister ensure that the government discuss this restructuring with our nato allies and also that they arrange for some kind of collaboration with industrial research for peaceful purposes in which we can join and which will be as good as that which we provided for defence <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as we have with our nato allies entered into many agreements with the soviet union on arms reduction does the noble earl agree with this point <e> <s> we should in no way bring about a reduction unless first it is done in collaboration with our nato allies and secondly what the soviet union says it is doing in reducing arms is subject to complete verification by britain and her nato allies <e>", "<cs> my lords if noble lords will be quiet i shall get on with it <e> <s> can the noble lord the leader of the house tell us whether what he said applies to british institutions or organisations which have been privatised and which having been privatised now have overseas and foreign elements <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what relations the government have with companies in the defence sector <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has already said that the government accept some aspects of the social charter <e> <s> therefore to enable us to understand what their policy is can he tell the house which aspects they support and which they do not <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this matter is only just beginning <e> <s> it is not an issue about privatisation or nationalisation or the squandering of funds by the publicly owned rover company <e> <s> if the noble lord were to read every newspaper in the country including todays edition of the great london newspaper the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that answer <e> <s> is she aware that the abuse of children is an appalling disfigurement of our present society <e> <s> is she further aware that the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children and many local authorities which monitor children at risk have found a per cent <e> <s> increase in child abuse <e> <s> does she recognise that they are finding difficulty in obtaining staff to look after the increased number of children at risk <e> <s> can the government do anything to help <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her encouraging words which will be well received by local authorities and the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children especially as it is said that children could now suffer from physical sexual abuse <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation could be worse <e> <s> it seems that the noble baroness will take <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that whereas the government have shown a lead in giving aid to some eastern european countires it might make political sense to give aid to the soviet union so that we might in years to come enjoy good trade with it <e> <s> as a result we would not have to give aid but could enjoy a sensible trading agreement with that country <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to my noble friend lord dean of beswick the noble viscount said that there were certain responsibilities on the industry to supply the government with information <e> <s> can the minister say whether the industry has been informed of that responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness said earlier that quite rightly this matter is under review <e> <s> i am sure that that will be warmly welcomed in all parts of the house <e> <s> will that review take into account the possibility that there may be insufficient laboratory scientists coming from the universities to meet what will be required for this and other matters <e>", "<cs> what is remarkable about the debate so far is that some members of the committee who love dogs are completely opposed to any form of registration and others who also love dogs fervently believe in registration <e> <s> arguments have been exchanged with good humour <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that drug trafficking is now a world evil of immense proportion and that there is little evidence that it is being brought under control <e> <s> can he say whether there are reasonable international discussions or whether the government believe that there is room for improvement upon present agreements and that more severe measures should be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for his reply particularly the last few words because the scheme is just as imaginative as it was when first mooted <e> <s> when the government have come to a decision will they ensure that parliamentary procedures are adopted that will require a bill so that the proposal can be examined <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that most people i believe thoroughly agree with the idea <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord if i missed his answer <e> <s> can he say why the budget of tvei was suddenly cut <e> <s> i do not recollect that he mentioned that in any of his replies <e> <s> if he can do so now it will be much appreciated <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that this is a very sad and poignant issue <e> <s> the health visitors association is very anxious about wandsworth as it was about the situation in greenwich <e> <s> would it not be sensible for the department to have discussions with the health visitors association so that there can be a joint contribution which might relieve a very sad and tense situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the health visitors are in the front line <e> <s> in this situation the health visitors are more important than the local authorities <e> <s> would it not be sensible and intelligent for the department to talk to the health visitors associations general secretary and her colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that one of the sad things that happened while shares were increasing in numbers from was that unemployment rose to an all-time high in this <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding the figures which the noble baroness has given is she aware that there is great strain on the london foot hospital which is known worldwide <e> <s> would it be possible for the department to offer some assistance to enable that hospital to overcome some of its problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> is she aware that recently the prime minister herself said that self-governing does not mean leaving the nhs altogether <e> <s> can the noble baroness explain what that means <e> <s> in circumstances where the majority of doctors and nurses wish to remain totally within the nhs will their desires be acknowledged <e> <s> thirdly can the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> thirdly can the noble baroness please explain what the inclusion of the words other units means <e> <s> many people would like to have that information <e>", "<cs> my lords does the figure include money which will be set aside for much needed modernisation of many hospitals and for the construction of new ones in various parts of the country where they are urgently needed <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that when we debated this issue in the house every speaker was anxious about the fact that supporters of pol pot were creeping back into power <e> <s> is he aware that this development was recognised most by the australian secretary of state for foreign affairs <e> <s> therefore can he say whether we are in close contact with the australians who have taken the lead in the matter <e> <s> i hope that they can count on the support of this country and of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord he good enough to consider having talks on this trying subject with the royal british legion which has many members who are so affected <e> <s> it is beginning to examine the proposition whether or not such exposure could be treated as a form of war wound <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> however can he tell us what criteria the government use for deciding whether or not a hospital should opt out of the national health service <e> <s> i am sorry i do not really mean opt out of the national health service scheme i meant to refer to hospitals becoming self-governing <e> <s> what precisely are the criteria upon which decisions will ultimately be made <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as the minister has outlined the criteria which will be used can one assume that the information will ultimately be published in detail <e> <s> further will it be possible for <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other speakers who have already expressed their sincere appreciation of the maiden speeches of my noble friend lord varley and the noble lord lord tombs <e> <s> one of the great things that i remember about when my noble friend was a cabinet minister is that he was always available to listen to what some of us might have assumed was advice or guidance <e> <s> his great gift was that he realised that the importance of parliament was on the benches behind the cabinet ministers <e>", "<cs> all british nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will allow me to say that if i had a choice i would choose that rather than throw million of my fellow citizens out of work for four years <e>", "<cs> my lords are the figures available for the rather worrying feature of unemployment involving young folk who have served and completed their apprenticeships and then go on the dole <e> <s> can the minister say whether the matter has been examined and the figures are available <e> <s> if not will it be examined <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what would be the policy if as it appears thousands of people in scotland feel that the poll tax is so unjust that they ought to have the courage and some probably will to resist it <e> <s> what would happen then <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether there have been any discussions with the existing seven youth organisations <e> <s> if not will there be such discussions and when they have taken place will those discussions be brought to parliament for further examination <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not agree that the fundamental point made by my noble friend lord callaghan of cardiff is that we are entering an incredible new era of massive changes in eastern europe and the soviet union <e> <s> therefore should not what has been requested on both sides of the house be a top priority of the government so that we can understand how things are developing keep pace and be able to respond in the correct manner <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give the house and the people of this country an indication as to when the final decision will be made so that the position will be clear <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the point of my noble friends question was to make certain that the answer she gave showed that all those involved in creating the new national health service trust hospitals had been taken into consideration <e> <s> can she say whether representatives of the majority of the people whom she mentioned are directly opposed to what the government propose <e> <s> if so will their views prevail <e> <s> will she confirm that when they have made their points it will not because the government continue to ignore them have been a waste of time <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us whether there are any statistics to indicate the amount of thieving from car boots and the amount of stolen booty put into car boots <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the importance of the subject would it not be possible to refer the matter back to the house after the ministers discussions with her right honourable friend in order that we can examine the result <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister clarify his comment that if any organisation threatens the government that it may be going bust it will be given licence to thwart the desire of parliament and if necessary to get round the policy of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords while acknowledging that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has asked a vitally serious question will the minister acknowledge that in addition to the points made by my noble friend the leader of the opposition in the past few months there have been statements by mr gorbachev which are encouraging <e> <s> would it not be possible for our government and our allies to make a direct approach to mr gorbachev to make a reality of his suggestions as well as our suggestions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that such services would be of great benefit to the airlines concerned <e> <s> indeed if he were to approach them he would do them a great favour because this issue does not merely include improving cultural economic and business relationships it is also an idea which would do the airlines the world of good <e> <s> will he approach the airlines and point out that that service would be an advantage for them and also an advantage for the other reasons that i have mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the house will remember for some time the two remarkable maiden speeches that we have been pleased to listen to today <e> <s> both the noble lord lord haden-guest and the noble baroness lady dunn lived up to their reputations as reflected in their speeches <e> <s> for some time i have been interested in hong kong in the other place as well as in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord address his mind to the reality of the situation and not to all these hypothetical economic statements <e> <s> with the present rate of inflation and because employment will probably fall as he has already said the people who will be hit hardest will be those buying their own homes <e> <s> those people have already suffered enormously at the hands of this government <e> <s> can the noble lord say that special consideration will be given to those people who are encouraged to buy their council houses and then find that they cannot pay the mortgage and those who are buying private houses and find themselves in difficulty <e> <s> when unemployment increases can something be done to help those people who are in that grievous situation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount explain to the house what he understood was the reason for introducing the dock labour scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he explain a matter which is perplexing many people in this country <e> <s> i refer to the fact that the confederation of british industry could hardly agree with anything that he has said this afternoon <e> <s> therefore will he say that what the cbi has stated in the press in its magazines and in statements made by mr john banham should be ignored because it is incorrect <e>", "<cs> my lords many people in this country are concerned about financial contributions by trade unions to the labour party and by the city to the conservative party <e> <s> i am not too sure who contributes to the liberal democrat party <e> <s> in so far as this concern has been reflected in the house today and the noble earl has taken full cognizance of it will he consider with the leader of the house the possibility of one day having a full debate on this particularly important subject so that the matter can be cleared up for the benefit not only of members of this house but for the people of this country <e>", "<cs> he is not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly willing to swap and to go to the other side of the house and ask my question right now <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that notwithstanding what appears to be his encouraging answer london transport is well aware of its shortcomings <e> <s> it knows what a terrible ordeal it is to travel on the northern line <e> <s> london transport is trying to alleviate the situation in order to prevent people using their cars and clogging up the roads <e> <s> does the minister not agree that only if the government are prepared to meet the london transport executive to try to understand its desperation and also to increase the finance available can some of the problems be resolved <e> <s> such action will have an immediate effect in reducing the chaos on londons roads and the appalling conditions under which people have to travel on some underground lines <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite wrong <e> <s> the problems of london transport began five years ago when the glc was relieved of its responsibilities <e> <s> then started the agony of the northern line <e> <s> the inefficiency of london transport dated from the end of the glc when transport was taken over by this government <e>", "<cs> my lords despite what the noble and learned lord lord hailsham has said <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree with the pronouncements of the confederation of british industry which no one especially the government should ignore that unemployment and bankruptcy will increase and that the nation could well be in a parlous state within the next months <e> <s> i understand why the government do not take too much cognisance of the cbi <e> <s> nevertheless does the minister not agree that it is a responsible organisation and that its views ought to be taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that the house was told that what is now happening could never occur <e> <s> who now is in charge the british government or british telecom <e> <s> will the minister draw this debate to bts attention and <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> are the government aware of the need to develop uk institutions to help in the field of tropical health <e> <s> are the government aware of the magnificent endeavours of mrs lynda chalker in the united states when on behalf of the millions who are threatened she spoke of the need to prevent starvation and death on a horrendous scale <e> <s> will the government be supporting the ministers desire to see action taken <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that a number of british periodicals and newspapers which specialise in these matters are submitting horrendous stories of millions of people who will probably starve to death unless help is forthcoming <e> <s> i give the minister one example to contemplate in the horn of africa where the rains failed millions now face starvation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that as we now have the highest rise in crime since the war chief constables and commissioners feel that the permitted limit should be increased <e> <s> is he further aware that there is an additional problem for police forces in outer london where parking problems are immense and where burglaries and break-ins are increasing <e> <s> police officers have to be used to control parking <e> <s> can consideration be given to permitting traffic wardens to assist the outer boroughs and thus help their police colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords the remarks made by the noble earl about my stature remind me of the incident when a tory mayor said that lloyd george was a very small man <e> <s> lloyd george being a welshman told the mayor not to worry as in wales people measure a man from the chin up <e> <s> is the minister aware of the report of the association of chief police officers who are somewhat concerned that not enough recruits are coming forward who are of the calibre to become ultimately medium grade officers <e> <s> will the minister look at that matter as it is causing some concern <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the question raised by my noble friend is an especially poignant one <e> <s> the poll tax affects many poor people and it hits disabled poor people more than anyone else <e> <s> if the noble baroness wants corroboration of that statement will she be prepared to consider talking to the disabled drivers association arthritis care and the societies for helping the aged <e> <s> those associations could give all the facts <e> <s> she is obviously unaware of them otherwise she would not have given such suave answers this afternoon <e> <s> will she contact the representatives of the disabled people of this country <e>"]
