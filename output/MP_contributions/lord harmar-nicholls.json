beginning of the session to let it be seen that he is a loyal and extreme supporter of his party <e> <s> what he has said can be made to sound so plausible <e> <s> i do not think that the house would mind the noble lords schedule <e> <s> indeed it is right that each house of parliament if it has any feelings at all on a matter should use the committee stage to make a bill what it wants it to be <e> <s> if the noble lord wants to bring in a schedule it is a good thing that it should be aired as it was in another place <e> <s> it was his government who refused to accept the point that he made about shareholders being able to contract out of contributions made to a political party <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the bill on which to argue that particular point <e> <s> however the noble lord knows as well as i do that in many unions the chances of getting a form to enable one to contract out are almost impossible because they are never supplied <e> <s> on a number of occasions when they have been asked for they have never been sent <e> <s> the noble lord also knows that in a number of unions the leaders are in fact appointed for life and it is very difficult indeed almost impossible to dismiss them <e> <s> i maintain that the shareholders of a company under the existing law have a greater control over their company than the members of a trade union have over the conduct of their union <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all if i could make a comment to my noble friend the leader of the house i hope that the practice of the opposite sides of the house being given their chance in rotation is not going to be altered because there is a new government <e> <s> the question i wanted to put to my noble friend was as follows while not overlooking the hopeful tone of the statement how well-based is the report on the front page of todays <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor agree that the principle on which <e>", "<cs> my lords it is obvious that we should approve the dispensation of standing order no <e> <s> on this occasion because the timetable insists that that should be done <e> <s> however i should be grateful if my noble friend would give some indication of how many other orders are likely to be affected <e> <s> is the joint committee likely to be established so that this is a once-for-all situation <e> <s> this scrutiny is vital because it is no use our criticising later after the horse has bolted <e> <s> while on this occasion it is right that we should face up to the circumstances of the timetable may we be told whether any more orders will be caught in this trap <e>", "<cs> the noble lord and his noble friends seem to love using words <e> <s> i should have thought in general terms that if there was one clause that was not necessary it was the new clause amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> why state the obvious <e> <s> if something wrong is being done then it ought to be taken into account in the full context of what has been done <e> <s> i ask your lordships to examine the words in new clause <e> <s> it states that a director shall act honestly <e> <s> i should have thought it was clear on both sides before anyone was elected to the board that he was expected to act as honest men would <e> <s> then we go down <e>", "<cs> all i would say as on the last occasion is that i do not quarrel with the words they are almost poetic words and they are words with which one could not disagree <e> <s> i merely said that they are unnecessary <e> <s> to clutter up the statute book with unnecessary words is bad parliamentary business particularly when you can get a fairer decision by letting them prove the case without trying to codify or to identify it before it happens <e> <s> i have nothing against the words <e> <s> so their lordships bench in the court of appeal or wherever it was can rest assured that i was not criticising their choice of the english language <e>", "<cs> i should like to know the thinking behind what the <e>", "<cs> i do not feel inclined to leave it entirely to the lawyers and professors on the other side when matters to do with companies are being discussed <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones used the word psychologically <e> <s> i believe that psychologically it would be dangerous to do what is being suggested in this amendment <e> <s> at the end of the day i believe that the responsibility of the board of directors is to the company the employees are part of the company the shareholders are part of the company and the executive directors are part of the company <e> <s> so long as you ensure that their skills and their endeavours are used in the interests of the company it means that they are using their skills and endeavours on behalf of all those groups <e> <s> to single out one group would be invidious and dangerous <e>", "<cs> i am glad to see that the leader of the house is in his place <e> <s> i wonder whether he feels that he could reinforce the point made by my noble friend lord redmayne who from his vast experience as chief whip in another place and as someone who understands the procedures and how a sessions work can be completely upset gave a very sensible warning to your lordships committee <e> <s> the position if i may remind my noble friend is that this bill has been submitted and accepted on all sides as a preliminary reform of the companies act as it affects directors generally and that there has been a clear undertaking given that cannot be questioned that the topics which are now being discussed in the form of amendments will be introduced within literally a few weeks time in the bill <e> <s> if it is that time is taken up by presenting the arguments on these amendments now with only to days of this session left it looks as though this bill will have <e>", "<cs> one thing ought to be said on that <e> <s> the noble lord has admitted that he wants the government to act out of panic because as he said of scandalous things that have recently happened <e> <s> the reason i am interested in wanting all these matters to be properly examined is that it is not only certain companies which caused the noble lord to panic but all companies big small and medium <e> <s> you are going to put them into a straitjacket within legislation which will not have been properly examined and digested <e> <s> i do not believe that a government ought to be put in a position of bringing in legislation out of panic <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend does not say that <e> <s> in their attempt to be conciliatory i think that perhaps the front bench have said too much <e> <s> they have committed themselves far too far down the road of what may be included in the bill <e> <s> they have accepted the general principle behind many of the arguments <e> <s> when they come to examine it i think they will find that they are unable to go that far <e> <s> to give the kind of undertaking for which the noble lord opposite has just asked would not give much happiness to those sitting behind the government front bench <e> <s> with regard to the money-lending companies most of what the noble lord said one agrees with from ones limited knowledge of what he calls the malpractices <e> <s> but in the case of money-lending companies which are doing their work in the normal way too many restrictions are perhaps imposed by this wording <e> <s> i do not wish to pursue that point although i may wish to return to it when we see it in detail in the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will know when we have sat together longer that i give no undertakings as to what i shall say <e> <s> i believe that the strength of parliament is that its members come along to talk freely about what they honestly believe <e> <s> if they think that certain things are worthy of reiteration they reiterate them <e> <s> as the noble lord has admitted we have had many repeats playbacks i think they call it on television of what we have said <e> <s> i promise the noble lord that if he even implies a repeat of some of the arguments <e>", "<cs> my noble friend did not say that it was not an important matter <e> <s> he said the exact opposite <e> <s> he said that it was a very important matter indeed <e> <s> nor did my noble friend say that he was not going to legislate on it <e> <s> indeed he made it clear that he was going to legislate on it <e> <s> he went further and said that the legislation to prevent this objectionable practice going on would be in stronger terms than these words in the amendment itself <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to help future decisions that will have to be made would it be possible for the <e>", "<cs> my lords what has happened to them <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it depends on whether you look at this in the short term or the long term <e> <s> in the long term high taxation and the extension of bureaucracy proves to increase unemployment <e> <s> from onwards when that policy has been applied by various governments that has been the result <e> <s> when other governments have adopted the opposite line of reducing taxation and minimising bureaucracy unemployment has come down <e> <s> so if it is the short term that the noble lord who asked the question has in mind it may well be that he wants to get his propaganda point in before the effect is proved to be otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down will he make one comment on what is a minor part of the massive and informative speech which he has just given us namely the answer which he gave to the point raised by the noble lord lord strabolgi about the cost of insulation affecting the rateable value of property <e> <s> it is a great sadness that he gave precisely the answer that the noble lord lord strabolgi and his noble friends used to give to me on that subject <e> <s> it is possible for the government to do something about this if it is only to send a circular to valuation officers asking them not to take into account the cost of something that can clearly he seen as an installation to save energy costs <e> <s> can the noble earl go that far on this point which is a minor one but which will cause a lot of irritation if we cannot get satisfaction from him <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend keep in mind that while he may not be able to accede to what my noble friend has just asked for in this case competition in the world for the skills required for both exploring and developing is very keen <e> <s> unless we have terms which make it reasonably attractive we may be too far back in the queue to get the benefits at a time when we want them <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend not allow the prejudices of the benches opposite against profits to interfere with the successful exploitation and production of oil from within our boundaries <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not an element of double talk in the comments made by the noble baroness when talking about business being rushed through this house without discussion when she was responsible for leading the team which brought about the guillotine and allowed so much important legislation to be made into law without having been discussed by either house <e> <s> that is an element of duplication which ought not to remain uncorrected <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether or not i have to declare an interest i am chairman of a public company that might have i do not think it has but it might have bingo attached to it and a private hotel company with which i am connected might have too i do not think so but in order to put it absolutely right i put that on the record for what it is worth <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that on matters such as this it is vital that we remain firmly within the law <e> <s> is he aware that in terms of our relationship with our partners in europe we may be passing through a critical stage <e> <s> some of them are wanting to ignore the rule of law in certain matters which could well bring about a breakdown in that very essential partnership <e> <s> would he agree that we must give a lead by seeing to it when a law or a regulation is in existence it is adhered to and if we are disquieted about anything we get our remedies through the courts and do not take unilateral action which undermines the very rule of law itself <e>", "<cs> apologise for interrupting the noble lord but i wonder whether he would assist me on a very important point <e> <s> he suggested that there could be some legitimate doubt as regards the impartiality of a minister and whether he would initiate proceedings <e> <s> he seemed to suggest that the chairman of the press council who is impartial and objective could perhaps be consulted because he is impartial and objective <e> <s> however he cannot speak with the authority of the rest of the press whereas a minister when he makes a statement involves the whole of the government <e> <s> therefore if one questions the impartiality of a minister one is questioning the impartiality of the whole of the government <e> <s> however the recognition that the chairman of the press council cannot with authority and certainty speak for the whole of the press in his reaction is i believe a possible weakness in the type of suggestion that the noble lord is putting to the government in asking them to give thought to amending the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that his reply which is explicit is rather puzzling in the light of what has happened recently <e> <s> it was suggested when the french did not obey the european court decision on sheepmeat that the reason they took the action they did was because there was no appeal from the european court and therefore they could not pursue it on the normal legal lines <e> <s> now the noble and learned lord is telling us that a matter which comes clearly within the purview of the british court can be sent to the european court and they give their decision afterwards which i should have thought would put the british court in the position of being to some extent a court of appeal from the european courts decision <e> <s> it is all rather puzzling <e>", "<cs> i have not noticed that my lords <e>", "<cs> we have just listened to what i would call a quibbling argument and a dangerously quibbling one at that <e> <s> it is parliament which is granting independence and that is what the bill is all about nobody but the two houses of parliament has given authority for independence to be granted under terms with which parliament has shown itself to be satisfied <e> <s> the actual date on which the formalities are completed is a matter that must be at the judgment of the government of the day and the reason why i say the argument to which we have just listened is dangerously quibbling is that it reflects a lack of confidence in your lordships house as to the good intentions and the good sense of the government when they come to whatever decision as regards the date that they will eventually have to reach <e> <s> if we here in parliament reflect such a lack of confidence are we not adding fuel to the arguments of people who for reasons quite different from whatever reasons may be

allowed if the circum <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend allow me to say to the noble and learned lord opposite that i was not questioning his propriety or his <e>", "<cs> my lords although my noble friend said that we ought not to underestimate the unanimity or near unanimity of support that he got from europe would he allow me to say that he ought not to over-estimate the value of that either because the reaction from the european parliament from its elected representatives was muted diffuse and not very impressive as regards the possible impact it may have <e> <s> will he allow me to say that i hope that he might get better support from the council of nine than he got from the elected parliament as i witnessed it a fortnight ago <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say apropos the last answer that one of the reasons for getting a new secretary of state and a new government is that they might reconsider previous decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question <e> <s> i always follow the noble baroness with great care <e> <s> is she suggesting that never in any circumstances on the basis of her argument ought taxes to be reduced particularly the high ones <e> <s> is that the end of her argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i had come to listen to the speeches in this debate with no intention of making a contribution but i do not think anybody with any sense of fairness

the house to make a comment at the right time <e> <s> the noble baroness always likes to interrupt me but i am not easily interrupted when there is a point that i think ought to be made <e> <s> the

on the speech of the noble baroness in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i will come to the speech of the noble baroness in a moment because there was one part of her speech which i found completely unacceptable <e> <s> but if i may deal with this point first the idea that in seven months you can expect the waving of a magic wand to produce the sort of panacea suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords the

reduction agreed in the last budget has not been made yet <e> <s> how does the noble baroness know how it will be used <e> <s> what evidence has she got that it is being used to enhance peoples standards of living with all the fripperies that the left wing always talk about <e> <s> there is no evidence yet that this tax reduction has been used in any other way than in a sensible and

lands tribunal must not come into this <e> <s> at the moment we have to accept the decision of the lands tribunal on valuation because we recognise their expertise in valuation <e> <s> but if one

the way this debate has been handled has been excellent and the record will be valuable to people who want to know the fundamentals behind the problem of energy production and distribution <e> <s> however because of the way the debate has developed we may be spoiling what i imagine the noble lord lord irving of dartford had in mind <e> <s> the one thing which a minister at the dispatch box welcomes is a wide-ranging debate technically based if possible for it gives him an excuse to fob off the question which has been asked <e> <s> if ever there were an occasion when the material was there for my noble friend to fob off the real question this is it <e> <s> but i know the minister does not want to do that <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to draw your lordships attention to the question which the noble lord lord irving of dartford has asked <e> <s> there is nothing erudite or very complicated about it <e> <s> it is very clear and it is this <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see the noble lords point but i was trying to say that it looks as though the americans are prepared in the short-term to put their energy industry at risk in order to help their general industry during a period of acute recession <e> <s> i believe that the recession is so acute and so real and the consequences can be so disastrous that we ought to think of doing the same not forgetting the long-term but putting it on one side in order to get over the short-term otherwise we might not have a chance to develop later <e> <s> that was my point <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it ought to be on the record that i think three years is too long <e> <s> if you want to remedy something that is going wrong the sooner you know about it and can apply a remedy the better <e> <s> the indication that something is going wrong is generally within two years and in order to support my noble friends reply to the noble baroness i would say that if anything he is being generous in the direction for which she argues <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord the lord advocate said that he was not being bureaucratic but i thought that his answer was the most obviously bureaucratic answer that i have heard from the dispatch box for a long time <e> <s> in effect he said we recognise that something should be done in this field that is surely what he meant when he said that he had a certain sympathy with the idea behind it but we must not make any attempt to do it now because by moving the dividing line it may create anomalies somewhere else we must let everybody suffer because in relieving people who deserve relief from it it may be that other people will not be having the same advantage <e> <s> i do not think that anybody <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that since the private enterprise zones are the solution to many difficulties that are causing disquiet in various parts of the country speed is of the essence if we are to maintain the morale to get us to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to discourage noble lords from putting down amendments at any stage on any bill but when on committee we have gone through the voting procedure and given a decision by vote is it not rather unwise when we have such an extensive marshalled list to repeat an amendment in this way <e> <s> when it has been withdrawn or not put to a vote so that a final formal decision has not been given it is sensible to pursue it but is it not a little time wasting to expect something that has been voted upon to be examined again in detail in the way this amendment would suggest <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that despite at least three circulars which to my knowledge his department has sent to local authorities asking for less rigidity in planning and a speedier decision there is still excessive rigidity and excessive delay <e> <s> if the department can use its powers in a statement such as this or an addendum to it to get local authorities to speed up their decisions on planning it would go a long way towards meeting the point raised by the noble baroness about getting investment into the building industry <e> <s> very many private developments are awaiting decisions which will take up much of the slack which has occurred owing to the cutback in public spending <e> <s> will the noble lord use this statement and all that flows from it to ensure that local authorities indulge in a little self-help instead of merely wanting to spend only public money channelled from the exchequer or from their own rate funds <e>", "<cs> i should like to cross swords with the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby on his description as to the role of this committee on a question such as this <e> <s> if we accept his judgment as to what our role is on a committee such as this we may as well not come <e> <s> is this a school debating society <e> <s> he says we can criticise it and debate it but we must do nothing about it <e>", "<cs> in answer to the question put to me before i sat down of course one ought to pay a lot of attention to what goes on in another place <e> <s> of course one ought to take into account that it has been examined perhaps more meticulously than we <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that million is earmarked and it is envisaged that four separate managements will operate as distinct from the one that exists at the moment has any thought been given to what proportion of the million will be allocated to each of the four and the reasons for the size of the allocation <e> <s> bearing in mind the damage that could be done if the whole group was put in jeopardy by one section creating the troubles that we have seen in the past could we have an assurance that the monitoring will look upon the four separate managements individually <e> <s> if one falls down because co-operation is not forthcoming then will they only lose the help that is now being offered to them and not the remainder <e> <s> on the other hand if one section falls to the ground for the reasons that i have just mentioned and various sections in bl in the past have shown themselves to be better or worse than others at various times then it will not be a matter of what is removed from the one section not going automatically to the other <e> <s> has any thought been given to how that will work out or does that need further thought in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords will the million that is being saved be spread over the whole country or will some sections get a lot and the others get none <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that most people would not wish the government to be deterred from making these very sensible alterations just because of the legal costs particularly when the legal costs are in keeping with the general rate that has always applied to business transactions of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that anything which encourages indexation is a time-delayed bomb which may well explode and cause a lot of damage later on and that this is something that ought to be looked at before it is given as a permanent encouragement <e> <s> i remember discussing this with bankers in brazil who were very much the victims of this <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that those bankers in brazil said that while this index road is something to use if one is on the point of death the

the disintegration of the european parliament <e> <s> it is the one thing which will not allow the european parliament to work in a way which will establish itself as a permanent feature <e> <s> is my noble friend also aware that the overwhelming view of the members of the european parliament is that it is vital that we should have some sort of stability which is not there at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that so far as europe is concerned the great problem is the excessively high rate of air fares <e> <s> may i ask him whether or not the government during the period of their presidency of the council of ministers could use that special position to see to it that freedom is given to more competition which would bring down air fares in that area as it has done in others <e> <s> during that period of six months we are in a special position to support the transport committee which runs the european parliament <e> <s> would my noble friend be prepared to recommend to the government that they do just that <e>", "<cs> my lords so that the cause and effect may be properly assessed can the minister say what proportion of the per cent <e> <s> increase mentioned by my noble friend results from the reduced block grant <e>", "<cs> i think that that raises a point that we ought to take into account <e> <s> i believe that these two amendments are legislating for special cases the very opposite to what the noble lord has said he does not want to happen <e> <s> i think that he is right we ought not to legislate for special cases <e> <s> i do not think that we ought here to concern ourselves too much with how the magistrates who hear all of the case and all the details connected with it ought to fulfilltheir functions <e> <s> i have sat as a magistrate for years and in these sorts of cases the magistrates have all the powers they need to deal with what they think are cases that ought to be hardly dealt with and they also have the discretion to be lenient where they think the circumstances are such that it warrants it <e>", "<cs> i should like to urge upon my noble friend to look at this again <e> <s> i honestly do not think that the convenience of the court comes anywhere near in importance to fairness and justice in law <e> <s> for what it is worth i remember that when i held a junior appointment which meant that the department was responsible for trafalgar square the metropolitan police brought along a whole list of regulations which they wanted to bring in <e> <s> if you broke a flower it was an offence if you grazed a plinth it was an offence if you put your hand in the water it was an offence <e> <s> i remember asking how do you deal with it now <e> <s> they replied we have to prove damage or nuisance to

can trail your finger in the water without doing any sort of harm <e> <s> i did not think that the convenience of the metropolitan police in order to get cases through quickly or that in the point of my noble friends argument the convenience of the courts ought to interfere with the discretion of the magistrates to assess the extent of the misdemeanour or mistake that has been made <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord lucas has made it perfectly clear that this is a probing amendment in order to obtain a reaction while there is still time to do something about it <e> <s> there is one aspect of this amendment that could perhaps be looked at <e> <s> as my noble friend pointed out the difference between accidents can be quite huge <e> <s> if someone has killed a person or maimed a person in an extreme way and then disappears as my noble friend put it into the night that is worthy of all the points that my noble and learned friend would want to put on that man <e> <s> but one can envisage other circumstances which may not be as blatant as that or where the accident may not be as damaging <e>", "<cs> my lords my instinct is against this amendment <e> <s> i recognise the attractiveness of cosmetically appearing to keep parliament fully in the picture and that this ought to be the case <e> <s> one recognises that one could preen oneself that one had protected the nation by getting these annual reports <e> <s> but my instinct is against it because statutory annual reports of all sorts become such a formality that they often do not play an important part in explaining the picture or in a sharing of minds with others <e> <s> where there is a great difference in this matter with private industry to which my noble friend lord de la warr referred is this <e> <s> private businesses have not got question time every day where any question one wants to put can be dealt with and one is kept up to date <e> <s> private businesses have no adjournment debates <e> <s> private businesses have not the same facilities for ministers in charge to come and give reports not necessarily annually but when they think they are necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend and i have been in

nothing is kept from the probing of mps if they really want to know about it <e> <s> it may not be done in a formalised way as in an annual report but there is no question but that if any member of parliament wants to know anything about anything in this country he can find out if he uses the machinery properly <e> <s> putting this in a formalised way attractive though it may seem is an unnecessary burden and will cause the use of a lot of paper and words which will not get us anywhere <e> <s> it is up to members of parliament apprised as they are by their constituencies as to what is wrong to use the facilities which are open to them and not to formalise their methods <e> <s> i do not know what will be the reaction of my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> he may want to accept it but i still think it is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i say to the noble lord that the probe you can make if you have an annual report as is proposed here is no wider and gives no more opportunity to go into depths than if you use the facilities in this place <e> <s> if you have an annual report you are still prevented by the table from going into the day-to-day running of the

who need freedom <e> <s> there is nothing you can do arising out of an annual report that cannot be done by questions or an adjournment debate or the proper use of the machinery set down in parliament for the use of members <e>", "<cs> my lords there was only one sentence in lord strabolgis speech to which i took exception although i also took exception to an implication in the remarks made by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> the noble lord lord strabolgi very promptly put a point of view and that is part and parcel of his job <e> <s> he put his point of view very well <e> <s> he explained the importance of various sections of the authority and the way in which it ought to be preserved because of the vital nature of the functions which it carries out <e> <s> but he skimmed over another aspect when he said that the national interest has to be left in the hands of the secretary of state and that one did not know what that interest was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying that nobody is more likely than the secretary of state with his special knowledge and access to knowledge to know whether firm <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is no need to be disturbed about this matter as the candidate concerned is showing himself to be so inadequate <e> <s> if he wants to use the dirty tricks department to reflect prestige and ability why not use a name

new regulation or has it been in force for some time through successive governments <e>", "<cs> i think we ought to remember in what capacity we are operating now <e> <s> this is not a second reading debate it is committee stage where we are writing in detail the words of a statute <e> <s> i think that the noble baroness lady david is in a way letting down the noble lord in what was a general admission <e> <s> she seemed to be accepting the practical advice given by lord alexander with his great experience and then said that we ought to indicate our general good intentions <e> <s> we ought not to try to generate genuine good intentions <e> <s> we have to write into the statute which people will adhere to things which are practical and will pass the test of being realistic <e> <s> to commit local authorities to have to work out detailed plans for a general intention which cannot for practical reasons be given effect to is wasting the time and diverting the attention of the authority from other things that they ought to be doing <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend a question <e> <s> following the point about trial without jury since so much wrong criticism comes from southern ireland because of a misunderstanding ought it not to be on the record that in addition to the system in northern ireland a similar system of trial without jury for terrorists exists in southern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords while i do not think anything extreme has happened i do think that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i said that i rather agreed with that and that i had much sympathy with the desire expressed by the noble and learned lord lord gardiner for an inquiry but i added the extra remark that however good the inquiry may be and whatever good may come from it one must be careful over the timing of it <e> <s> one must be careful that the timing does not give an impression of weakness or an admission of guilt which could do even more harm than the good which could flow from the inquiry <e> <s> i was really supporting the plea made by the noble and learned lord lord gardiner for an inquiry provided that my noble friends took into account the dangers that wrong timing could carry <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the generalisations in the brandt report will not replace the hard and sensible thinking that is given to all of those matters <e> <s> it is too full of clichs without the backing of research <e>", "<cs> for me to accept it as the bible as so many people seem to be doing <e>", "<cs> there is one remark which ought to be made <e> <s> i think that noble lords are over-egging the pudding when they talk about subsections to which it is suggested be amended <e> <s> i do not think that these subsections are so complicated <e> <s> i find all legislation pretty complicated by the time one has tried to find words to put into a statute which say what you really mean <e> <s> it is true that the amendment of the noble lord lord avebury is more simple <e> <s> but if this is the worst of the most intricate words that we have to use then we do not have much to grumble at <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether it is not generally accepted that if one is unemployed and is registered as unemployed then in terms of benefits of this sort one is looked upon as being employed <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has been very effective in the reply he has given to this interesting debate but he seemed to close the door completely whereas the lord advocate on the previous amendment left the door open at any rate to the point where the matter would be looked at again although he made it clear that the chances of finding something different were remote <e> <s> in my view this amendment justifies the same treatment <e> <s> tying the provision so completely to employment as it now is and ignoring self-employment and all the categories which the noble lord lord spens mentioned justifies another look at the whole matter <e> <s> on the few occasions when i have intervened in this committee stage i have asked the committee to support the discretion given to the secretary of state because there will be some very grey areas where somebody will need discretion to sort it out <e> <s> in this clause it looks as though discretion is being taken from him because the words are so specific and when we come to the provision dealing with days that removes a discretion which i had hoped the secretary of state would be left free to use to form a judgment <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend is on the wrong track here <e> <s> i should have thought that at the time that the decision was to be made the secretary of state would be in a better position than we are now to decide whether the occupation was of benefit to the united kingdom <e> <s> here we are years ahead of any situation that is likely to arise <e> <s> i have much sympathy with the amendment <e> <s> this subject is quite intricate and i should like to congratulate the government on having the courage to bring in the bill in the first place <e> <s> many previous governments have run away from it they have put it under a rug <e> <s> the government are entitled to all the credit for having the courage and the tenacity to deal with this very important and essential matter <e> <s> we know that the reason why previous governments did not deal with this subject is because it is filled with marginal problems and that difficult and intricate points might well arise <e> <s> they sound hypothetical now but they will be quite real when decisions have to be made <e>", "<cs> clauses and are the only parts of this bill which cause me any disquiet and and do not strike me as being clauses which have been put together by a conservative minister <e> <s> they have been put in by civil servants and that has been confirmed by the words used by my noble friend <e> <s> he said that we must not do something that is generally good because it might be abused <e> <s> they are always terrified of the one or two who will abuse something <e> <s> on the basis that something cannot be done because it might be abused by a minority you would never have a budget because in every budget people find ways of getting round what was intended in the budget <e> <s> but what do you do <e> <s> in future budgets you stop up those loopholes when abuse has been seen to have taken place <e> <s> i believe that when this bill becomes an act there may well be some weak points in it left open to abuse by one or two who will find loopholes <e> <s> it is then up to parliament at the time when the loopholes are found to stop them up but not to begin by not being fair to the self-employed and the categories mentioned by the noble lord lord spens who really do make such a great contribution to the general well-being the wealth and the reputation this country has in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the recent proposals referred to in the question are really the old proposals which when the present opposition were in government resulted in million unemployed with the figure rising <e> <s> that was at a time before the world depression which has made things so much more difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while his answer has rectified it to some extent the question as it stands depicts very dangerous trends in suggesting that the government and the unions should talk <e> <s> are not management and the owners of businesses to have any say in how their labour should be deployed in the interests of their companies and the country <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friends explanation mean that if people who control what they think is a private road put up a notice saying that the public are prohibited the effect would be that the amendment was in operation <e>", "<cs> if it is the intention of my noble friend lord geddes to push this amendment to a division i would expect my noble friend the minister to be in the lobby with us because the words in the bill do not square with what he said at the box <e> <s> he said that he would be satisfied as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said if the employment was significant <e> <s> the words do not allow significant to come into it <e> <s> it is full-time <e> <s> that has a real meaning <e> <s> there is no doubt that if full-time remains as the definition it will restrict the bill to a point where i doubt whether it will be workable <e> <s> all the arguments which have been used regarding women part-time consultants and the rest are very strong <e> <s> but now that we have more or less had to accept that employment is going to be the touchstone as to whether or not it passes the test i believe that from that point on we ought to be as broad and as sensible as we can as to how employment will be interpreted <e> <s> i was very impressed with the point made by the noble lord lord spens regarding one of his amendments that employment as we see it today may well not be the type of employment which will be generally accepted as meaning employment or years from now when this bill if it becomes an act will be operative <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend decides what to do may i say this <e> <s> i apologise for not being here earlier but i was in another committee <e> <s> when i saw that my noble friends amendments were being called with both of which i have a lot of sympathy i wanted to come in <e> <s> i would not have added my voice my vote would have been sufficient if it were called for except for the defence which my noble friend lord belstead has put up which i find particularly irritating <e> <s> in his first reply he explained why this amendment could not be accepted <e> <s> in some intricate way somebody may be able to turn and twist it and one half of the family may be on the continent while the other half is here <e> <s> that kind of defence putting up this mythical convoluted and intricate argument to get around something is disturbing because it is no answer to the possibly hundreds or thousands who for quite genuine reasons need the kind of protection which this amendment would give <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said that he thought the suggestion made by the noble lord lord mishcon was excellent <e> <s> i think that it is the opposite of excellent <e> <s> the idea that some pamphlet can override what is written into a statute the idea <e>", "<cs> my lords in the presence of the leader of the house and the leader of the opposition is my noble friend aware that it is disturbing to many who have seen the questions order paper in another place deteriorate to the point of being a farce that in your lordships house the same trend is allowing us to get into that situation <e> <s> questions which with one exception are based purely upon party political ploys are not in accordance with the dignity of this house and many of us hope that that will not continue <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that any reasonable person would recognise the lack of wisdom in giving the blanket cover that is asked for in this question <e> <s> certainly individual cases <e>", "<cs> i think that there is some point in the noble lords question <e> <s> whether it is done by agreement behind a chair or in any other way it means that it is anticipating parliaments decision before that decision has been made <e> <s> if there are strong reasons for that outside needs that could be explained it might well be that one could overlook it <e> <s> but without those reasons i think that we ought jealously to guard the fact that we still have the power to oppose this date if there are good reasons for doing so and the anticipation could therefore be an embarrassment <e>", "<cs> while we welcome the explanation given by the minister and his statement that in anticipation of the bill being approved appropriate action had been taken in the form of agreements which he thought would meet the problems which had been outlined by noble lords on both sides of the house and it seems as though those agreements will work out all right why should that mean that we cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> i should have thought that the amendment being written into the bill would strengthen those arrangements which i gather will be agreed to once the bill has gone through its parliamentary procedures and received the royal assent <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is spoiling a good case by bringing in that kind of argument <e> <s> if one has followed the bill through all the stages in another place one will know that there is no question at all that the government have done nothing other than genuinely try to bring about a solution to a very difficult problem <e> <s> they have used all the machinery of government with all the skill and advice that they have to bring that about <e> <s> so i am rather sorry that the noble baroness wanted to inject a comment of bad faith into what has gone before that is not the case <e>", "<cs> i think this is a point which ought to be pursued <e> <s> the noble lord lord stewart and most noble lords who have spoken have held high office so when they come to your lordships committee which is a revising chamber they come with a lot of experience <e> <s> their experience often tells them when they are producing legislation to be considered that you have to read between the lines quite apart from the actual words being discussed <e> <s> the part that interests me and worries me a little bit is the fact that the government are resisting this amendment <e> <s> ought we to be reading between the lines <e> <s> are the government in a position to give by a hint or a blink even if they cannot use words an indication that agreements that they have entered into which in the long term are in the interests of belize would be injured if for some reason these words were put in <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend given an indication that the government intend to accept the amendment that he says is on the marshalled list in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i was interested to hear the way the noble baroness dismissed the phrase under review as not committing central government or other authorities to something that could be quite onerous in certain circumstances <e> <s> under review in the terms of a legal statute means something <e> <s> it means that the matter really has to be kept under review and i should have thought this was less likely to become onerous under certain circumstances for instance if a specific time limit of two or three years were given <e> <s> but to leave it under review in that open-ended way in certain circumstances with the reaction of certain people could become very onerous indeed <e> <s> i should have thought that in terms of good language in the statute this was much too wide to be accepted in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the last words of the noble lord lord-boyd-carpenter have put on the record the sort of thing that was disturbing me <e>", "<cs> i echo the words of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter when i ask how can we at one and the same time say that we agree to pass a bill which we say is full of injustice and which will exacerbate racial relations and which will do that amount of harm <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i heard the noble and learned lord say that at the beginning but i doubt whether it is the convention that in passing a bill one should add words such as those which exist in the noble and learned lords amendment <e> <s> i would like the noble and learned lord to produce a similar amendment from the past <e> <s> is he aware that he may well be setting a precedent and a dangerous one at that <e> <s> the whole idea of the parliamentary system is that one fights to try to get the right answer in a bill and battle hard through all the stages of second reading committee report and third reading <e> <s> the whole idea behind parliamentary government among civilised people is that if one has lost the argument one allows the bill one has lost to have a fair run <e> <s> this amendment is not giving the bill a fair run <e> <s> i believe that is absolutely against the principle of parliamentary government as i have experienced it <e> <s> it is because i feel so strongly that i wanted to add my words to those of my noble friend lady elles in a debate which has been so unbalanced <e> <s> i hope that even at this late stage many of your lordships who thought of supporting this amendment will have second thoughts <e> <s> i believe that the amendment is dangerous unnecessary and in the words of the noble and learned lord himself is against the conventions of the way in which this house passes its bills <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the very cogent point put by the noble lord lord monson i see this as part of a bigger and wider strategy which the noble baroness just does not seem to see <e> <s> for years <e>", "<cs> my lords i heard the noble baroness ask her question <e> <s> that is what i am referring to and i have no doubt knowing her well that she puts the whole of her argument into one question when she really tries <e> <s> but she put a question to my noble friend asking how certain people would be able to afford it and she is viewing this in the narrow short term <e> <s> looking at it from that point of view there is a certain logic in the point she makes but i am asking the noble baroness and indeed my noble friends to look upon this as part of the bigger strategy <e> <s> those others who have tried to deal with housing matters in both houses have recognised for years that the private sector has not been making the contribution it could make to provide houses for rent and the reason is because they have been clobbered on every hand and it literally has not been worth their while to think in terms of such an investment <e> <s> i am hoping this is the point i should like to put to my noble friend that this is only a beginning <e> <s> i hope this is getting the toe in the door and really recognising that a great contribution can be made in regard to the housing shortage which is the real problem not the one about students and others <e> <s> there is a housing shortage which is <e>", "<cs> which is being kept as part of our problem because we have not given the encouragement that the private houseowner and landlord are entitled to have and which they did have for years until it was taken away <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so to the noble baroness who is one of my pin-ups i think i must say to her that she really must not be touchy because the object of parliament is to share minds on these matters and whether one has been in at the beginning of a debate or at the end if there is a contribution to be made it should be made and if there is a good point to be made then it should be made <e> <s> one has not to think of the susceptibilities of the noble baroness or of anybody else <e> <s> i hope that we are going to have the beginning of a real housing development one where the private sector will be able to make a real contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody knows better than the noble lord because he and i sat in another place that there are many ways of reaching the object <e> <s> indeed it was explained to me very clearly once by sir robert menzies who i suppose along with sir winston churchill was one of the outstanding parliamentarians of all time <e> <s> when he was explaining the sort of problem which the noble lord has put to me he said people who do not understand parliament do not understand that if you want to get from one point to another you cannot go in a straight line <e> <s> realising the parliamentary problems you go forward two steps back one <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my voice to that of the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> i hope not only that this will be looked at but that it will be looked at with sympathy with the intention of arriving at something like the wording of the amendment <e> <s> i do not know how many noble lords are aware of this but the interference of the rigidities of the fire precautions investigations today may serve a very good purpose in theory but in practice it perhaps does more harm than good in the way that it is applied in slowing up actual developments and improvements that ought to take place <e> <s> i should have thought that the words used by the noble lord in his amendment were fair enough and if the amendment is to be looked at again i hope it will be with a view to strengthening rather than weakening the intentions behind the words in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind the reply given by president reagan if not us who <e> <s> if not now when <e> <s> when we are thinking in terms of protection in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords while the subsidised arts are entitled to some sort of special consideration such as the noble lord lord jenkins suggested may i ask my noble friend also to remember <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that people who have studied the actual mechanics of the community will support his view that on the question of contributions and agriculture it means a long-term solution rather than a piecemeal and temporary one <e> <s> otherwise the general unity of the spirit of the community will suffer from time to time when it is considered <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the agricultural policy the contribution and the regions are agreements that should run together and that to try to separate them would only bring confusion such as we are suffering in this country at the moment where we have two agreements which are apparently in conflict and which have brought <e>", "<cs> although the mental health act commission is very important the operation of parliament and its work is perhaps even more important <e> <s> if there can be found a formula which does not interfere with the point i make all well and good but to put an obligation in such a mandatory form as this that it must be a report whether annually or biennially may well mean that we shall be overloading the parliamentary machine in a way which really will be dangerous <e> <s> there are innumerable ways in which parliament can service any of these matters for instance adjournment debates question time the consolidated fund <e> <s> if there is a real weakness or something that parliament ought to supervise and deal with there are innumerable ways in which it can be done <e> <s> but if we write into a bill that there must be an annual or biennial report that must be fulfilled and that will mean extra staff extra time and extra concentration upon theory instead of the time being devoted to the practical problems that arise <e>", "<cs> i do not think that my noble friend lord renton was making heavy weather of this matter there is a point that ought to be born in mind particularly at this stage <e> <s> as i tried to make clear in my last intervention i am interested purely in the machinery of parliament not in the actual merits of the bill relating to the mental health act itself <e> <s> i do not like clause for this reason if left as it is it will interfere with parliament doing its work properly <e> <s> as i said previously when there was a suggestion of an annual report there is no need for an annual report because it would take up time <e> <s> i should like to say to my noble friend lady macleod of borve that annual reports sometimes cover up information rather than give new information which could be helpful <e> <s> it is very easy in a report to cover over a point which if otherwise presented could be latched upon by parliament so gaining much more satisfaction in regard to something that was wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords keeping the last question in mind does my noble friend also take into account that the number of unemployed has been swollen by million married women who in previous years would not have ranked to be included in the statistics at all <e>", "<cs> my lords it was very uncertain guidance that the house received from my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> if we give this bill a second reading and it goes through the whole of its courses what would the government have in mind hinder or help <e> <s> would it perhaps eventually prove to <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether or not any member of the community other than ourselves has made the representations which apparently have brought about quite a happy response as he has announced to my noble friend lord bethell <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while there can often be a lot of merit in discussion and that up to a point one has to have that if discussion goes on too long you can miss the boat <e> <s> i should like to ask how which is the year as he announced when something tangible may be seen compares with what other countries in europe have in mind <e> <s> for example in what year do the french anticipate taking advantage of this new technological development <e> <s> one has to remember that when the last channels were allocated for sound broadcasting we did not earn a very good reputation <e> <s> indeed the story went around that when the channels were being allocated our representative happened to fall asleep and as a result we got the worst end of <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening a second time but in view of the last two questions will my noble friend bear in mind that if even before it has started we give the impression that we will surround it with all sorts of regulations and nannying from central government it may be that the finance which would be forthcoming from people who take up subscriptions will not be there <e> <s> let us accept that we will get the satellite scheme moving but not that we will tie it in with so much regulations and red tape as to make it unpleasant for people to operate it afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many people will be surprised and disappointed to learn that central government are not collecting evidence on this issue and are not sorting out whether it is good or bad <e> <s> is he further aware that the point made by the noble baroness lady birk should be confirmed or denied by the facts facts which would be available if central government took the trouble to get all the evidence collated <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what formula is adopted to adjudge what is half of their time and whether or not the unions ever make any contribution to the half-times for the cost of the work they do <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that since noble lords are responsible for the accuracy of questions on the order paper and one would imagine the implications behind them they ought to take greater care to see that there is some basis for suggesting certain things before placing the questions on the official order paper of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to publicity is my noble friend making full use of television through both advertising and news and documentary programmes in order to bring the schemes to the attention of possible recruits <e>", "<cs> my lords is my

schemes which sounded very attractive as he presented them have the effect of increasing inflation and not encouraging a reduction of interest rates that might have the opposite effect <e> <s> the

friend mr michael brown the member for brigg and scunthorpe and to the ingenuity and skill that he used in getting the bill through the other place so making it possible for it to come before your

drawn out of the ballot one is able to choose a bill that will add to and may improve the general legislation of the country <e> <s> it is also well known that if one comes out of the ballot beyond sixth place owing to the time factor the chance of getting a bill through is very remote <e> <s> my honourable friend mr brown was eleventh in the ballot and those who understand the procedures in the other place will know that in those particular circumstances it requires tenacity skill and charm in order to overcome the shortages of time and get through the labyrinth of procedure <e> <s> mr brown did that and he has proceeded with the bill to a point at which i think your lordships will find it acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that i have had consultations personally but i have had a letter which has given every indication that what is recommended in this bill would have their approval and they would find it very desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many people will be surprised to read his reply that this is a matter which should be left to the area health committees <e> <s> if there is any point behind this question surely it is a national problem

some way <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if it is the quality of the health service that brings students there is no other country in the world even when a scheme is in operation

move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords the only reason why i want to intervene is that i do not believe that the three speeches we have heard from noble lords that is with the exception of that from my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye represent in any

to interpret the historic exchange that has taken place have a copy of it as well <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many people hope that the government and future governments will

the final decision if there is anything that is considered to be not right <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend lord trefgarne aware that most observers would have to suspect the protests coming from the benches opposite when one compares the attitude they adopted when they had the responsibility of government with what they are saying now particularly in light of the fact that they have never moved from their claim for per cent <e> <s> which is above the figure of inflation and twice that given to the armed forces <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i did not quite

united states were just as adamant as they were when they were dealing with the community as a whole <e> <s> was any concession made at all in regard to the possibility of a bilateral agreement in

great respect to my noble friend may i point out that there have been four questions from the benches opposite critical to the government and only one question from this side <e> <s> i believe that is an imbalance which would not perhaps be in keeping with what we would expect when matters such as this are being presented in the form of a statement <e> <s> in these circumstances is it not correct to suggest that one more question should be allowed <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand from my noble friend that we have contact with the french government through the ems <e> <s> does that mean that although we are not members of the ems we do take part in any discussions arising within that organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords the spirit behind the amendment should commend itself though i do not think we should accept it because it is too specific in that it would hinder the police by for example referring to three or more which might prevent them from carrying out the job we all want them to do of keeping the roads clear <e> <s> however i hope the police can have their attention drawn to the need to use <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord does press the amendment i shall vote with the government but i hope that the government will heed the arguments that have been put forward <e> <s> i am not at all impressed with the matter being left to the home office experts without guidance on a scale that might be envisaged in the words of the amendment <e> <s> i shall explain why i am not entirely happy <e> <s> the example i am about to give is not completely analogous but it is enough to disturb ones confidence <e> <s> i remember a situation where application was made to erect a building that had to house inflammable materials <e> <s> in one area it was left in the hands of the local people without the sort of guidance that ought to have been coming from the top <e> <s> the answer was given that the building should have a concrete roof of a certain thickness that the doors and shelving must be made of steel <e> <s> that advice seemed very logical and sound <e> <s> the plans were prepared and the building erected according to that general guidance <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not think that if we are going to discuss the effect which gas has on the general economy we ought to remember history that when the cost of gas was going up it was a minister of the previous government who put all the extra cost on to industry which may well have helped to bring up the figures of unemployment <e> <s> ought we not to make up our minds as to where our priorities lie to help bring down unemployment by helping industry or merely to make propaganda points for the sake of getting them on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that

noble friend have any idea when the noble lord lord hatch will run out of irrelevant questions <e> <s> will she bear in mind that this one in the context gets very near to being an abuse of the

completely free to withdraw without any type of penalty being imposed <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if the words television and productions in the question can be deemed to mean mixing fiction with hypothesis and presenting it as fact that should certainly be discouraged whether it is for or against using nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords before we confuse ourselves by over-simplifying the problems of the world by suggesting that part of the school curriculum can overcome them will my noble friend lady young tell me how many international bodies educational or otherwise have ever solved an international problem <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the last question and answer does my noble friend not think that it would be a good idea if the activists at home were to hold their horses until they have made their contacts abroad and they look like producing something equivalent <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down did i understand him to say that as <e>", "<cs> my lords i am looking at the clock but i just wondered why the noble lord was so frightened of telling what he called the ordinary people that they have a contribution to make <e> <s> was it not their appetite that helped the borrowing which brought about these terrific interest payments which he says are the basis of all the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend leaves that point may i say that i have sat through the whole of the debate i have enjoyed it and i have learned a lot from it <e> <s> i have listened particularly because i wanted to

sorry that i am taking precedence over one of my favourite colleagues in this house <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that people recognise the catastrophic effect that the world depression is having upon this vital steel industry that they would like both houses of parliament on all sides to appear to be dealing with it bereft of any sort of party advantage or party propaganda <e> <s> is he aware

by asking if my noble friend was aware and that is a question <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the one point made by the noble lord the leader of the opposition is one which comes from all parts of the house and from all parts of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to quarrel with my noble friend but that was not the attitude adopted by all previous questioners <e>

has a very deep feeling about the consequences that can flow <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the one point on which there is unanimity throughout the country is that our partners in europe and our allies in the world should be forced to play their part in facing up to the world depression <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that while the strategy that is being adopted is the correct one it will not be accepted unless it can be felt that the contribution is being shared by all of the countries who will benefit once we have got over this difficulty <e> <s> i repeat the question what are the government prepared to do to insist that our allies and our partners play their part in helping the world to overcome this very disastrous consequence that is hitting at present <e>", "<cs> my lords on a further point of order if the noble lord is going to proceed with his question i think the house should give a clearer indication as to how it feels about that before the matter goes to the procedure committee because however one reads the question as a whole it is an expression of opinion and as the noble lord on the front bench opposite has said one has seen this sort of thing developing and it is something which is not in the best interests of the house as a whole <e> <s> therefore if the noble lord is going to try to proceed with his question i believe that the house ought to give its view as to what ought to be taken into account and i <e>", "<cs> my lords i formally propose that this house decides that this question be not heard <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of standing orders <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of standing orders and if it is the view of some of us that the self-discipline upon which the ruling of this house has previously been based is on the verge of breaking down it may well be that the view of the house as a whole as to whether that tendency ought to be allowed to continue should be put to the test at the earliest opportunity <e> <s> but in view of the fact that my noble friend the leader of the house has made a suggestion and as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones said it was the convention that we accept the ruling of the leader of the house i shall be happy to withdraw my motion in the hope that the noble lord lord jenkins will also heed what was behind the ruling of the leader of the house and not proceed with his question <e> <s> attention has been drawn to it and perhaps honour can be satisfied on all sides <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in all ranges of industry as a result of increases in rates many sections are having to face problems and painful difficulties and that the nation as a whole would expect the student fraternity to play their part in bringing about the essential economies that are necessary if we are to get back again to sound money and sound levying of taxes <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the bewilderment is not confined to one side of this chamber <e> <s> things are not as normal <e> <s> the argentines still claim that they are at war with this country at least they have not been prepared to admit that the war is over <e> <s> at a time when certain of our allies are recommending sanctions against friends it seems to me rather bewildering that they are prepared to give aid in this economic form to people

three and a half years ago but i have always tried to follow the results of the deliberations which the various select committees have carried out <e> <s> i have to tell your lordships that one of the reasons why i wanted to make a contribution to the debate today was to say just this that i hope the select committees will carry on doing their work because i can assure them that there is no report

ourselves on the back that literally is a fact <e> <s> the number of times that the results of the select committees reports are quoted in support of arguments or to further a particular point of view

the select committees to carry on in the same line in future as they have done in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand from the series of answers that my noble friend has given that while britain has a clean bill of health as it clearly has on this matter we are somewhat disappointed that some of our allies indeed our partners in europe do not seem to have quite the same attitude to this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> as a public company of which i am chairman has an interest in one licensed bingo club i declare that as an interest but i hasten to emphasise that the reason i am pleased to be taking the initiative in commending this bill to parliament is in no way connected with that interest <e> <s> i am doing it

covers the three main ingredients that i think a private bill ought to have <e> <s> it is extremely modest in its scope and it has the approval of the gaming board a statutory body set up by the government in <e> <s> the third reason is that it will add to the enjoyment of something like million people in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel a certain amount of satisfaction from that reply but i have to say that it is very limited <e> <s> we agree in principle that what is behind the bill if it could be implemented properly is satisfactory to the government <e> <s> we know that it is satisfactory to the gaming board <e> <s> i believe <e>", "<cs> my lords did my noble friends answer to the second supplementary mean that he was prepared even to consider having to wait for a parliamentary debate before the proper distribution of staff could be decided upon <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the arrangements being untenable is it not a fact that since every new prime minister whatever party they have represented has looked at it and has agreed the arrangement which stands today <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble and learned friend aware that many will be disturbed that a question such as this appears on your lordships order paper <e> <s> to imply however obliquely that the judges need guidelines from politically orientated governments is disturbing when one considers the importance of the impartiality of the judges in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords after having heard the most effective speech of the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale i wonder whether i have made a mistake <e> <s> i have decided not to pursue the two points that in my minutes i intended to make when i asked for my name to be added to the list because at the end of the day this is a debating chamber <e> <s> i think the effectiveness of parliament is by debate and i feel that there were one or two points which if allowed to go without some kind of antidote would do more damage in the long term <e> <s> therefore i hope that in presuming to do just that i am doing the right thing <e>", "<cs> but my lords we know the noble and learned lord well enough to know that of course he had an alibi up his sleeve <e> <s> that is why i referred to him as being experienced and astute <e> <s> but the main burden of the minutes that he took and which were very effective had nothing whatever to do with the gracious speech but had a lot to do with what he expected would be the problems we would be debating in the future <e> <s> there is no doubt about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the findings of that inquiry were that justice had not been done but not that timothy evans on the evidence that came before the original trial had been shown to be not guilty <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had met that point <e> <s> absolutely <e> <s> if the evidence that came out later in the following trials had been there for the original trial there is little doubt that he would not have been found guilty in those terms <e> <s> there is no doubt about that <e> <s> all i am saying is that it is not in accordance with the evidence that existed then to use that in an argument to state positively that we ought never to consider the possible reintroduction of capital punishment for any grade of crime in any way <e> <s> as i have said i believe that we ought to approach it in a more open-minded fashion <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will allow me that is precisely what i said <e> <s> i said that the matters that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones spoke on so eloquently and so effectively had nothing whatever to do with it <e> <s> if that had been in the gracious speech he would have been on to it like a shot <e> <s> this issue is anticipating a debate

are very good practical reasons why the discretion should be left to the minister <e> <s> is he not aware that one of the problems in parliamentary government is that we produce words which become firm and fixed upon which in this case the office of fair trading has to operate hut which by the very nature of things cannot always take into account all the surrounding circumstances whereas the minister can do that and that to that extent one is likely to get justice from the ministers discretion rather than from the rigid parliamentary word as laid down in the act itself <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that anyone who played any part in the last election would recognise that the nation was satisfied that the present membership of the house of commons truly represents the antipathy that they felt to the alternative policies offered by the government in which the noble lord served as a minister and which his present party supported and sustained during a difficult period and that this has to be in the real interests of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friends last reply to the noble lord that she did not want to be dragged into talking about increasing own resources does not reflect any weakening on the necessity of not agreeing to the increase in own resources until greater efficiency relating to the common agricultural policy has come into operation <e> <s> the statement today is in general terms but in the reports one has read in the newspapers one sees a couple of sentences from the foreign secretary which could give the impression that the government would agree to increasing own resources before the actual efficiency has been brought into operation <e> <s> a mere promise to do something is not good enough in view of the absolute necessity to clear away the wasteful surpluses which flow from the present way that the system is being worked <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that to adhere to what is suggested in this question would mean the government abdicating their responsibilities <e> <s> they won the election on the very clear understanding that they would preserve the tried and trusted system which has served this country successfully over very many years <e> <s> a referendum gives an alibi to a government and no government <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that to give a government an alibi by referring to a referendum weakens the power which a government can have <e> <s> they have a responsibility for success or failure which should be clearly seen <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the question he is asked is what changes of policy is he likely to recommend <e> <s> is he aware that the policy as announced has brought the credibility and the creditability of this country higher in the eyes of the world than they have been for a quarter of a century <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has received two sets of advice on what i think is the number one problem that is whether or not we agree to an increase in own resources <e> <s> he had the advice put in the form of a question from the noble lord lord bruce who suggested that we should not countenance an increase until such time as restraint has been shown in the expenditure on agriculture which flows from the common agricultural policy <e> <s> then he had the advice of the noble lord lord banks who suggested that it might be sensible to give an increase in own resources in return for breaking the log-jam on the others <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that so far as the theatre is concerned a sensible consideration of reducing the vat impost may very well produce extra financial resources for the chancellor and at the same time encourage the earning of invisible exports <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in this area of delay in granting applications to which the computer will not be the answer too many have a say in granting approvals and too many tiers of local government have to be gone through before you receive a practical reply and can get on with the job of building houses factories or anything else <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that for those reasons one hopes that the government will proceed with removing at least one of the tiers of government in order to speed up the process <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend approve of the order paper being used as a vehicle for denigrating the standing of people who have authority in these difficult circumstances particularly when we have open to us all approaches to ministers to examine any legitimate grievances which we may have <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the implied criticism over the sale of nationalised assets is concerned should it not be emphasised and re-emphasised that it does not mean that the nation has lost that asset <e> <s> if it is privately owned it is just as effective <e> <s> perhaps it is more effective if it is more efficiently run than merely having the shares and the ownership in the hands of the state <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble and learned friend say whether anybody anywhere has the power to tell the police to reduce what is called their input when they are carrying out their duty <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend not disturbed that with the exception of the last question which did not fall into this category all the questions on this subject so far seem to imply that the americans were wrong and that the russians did nothing very wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble marquess lord tweeddale said the arguments have been pretty well put by now <e> <s> however i think that one ought to examine the arguments that have been put to see how they fit in with ones instinct on this

may be difficult in another place but we would come out of it all right <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend emphasise the fact that the words used by our right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary when he said that he had doubts are very different from the word fraudulent which the noble lord lord hatch of lusby wants to use <e> <s> that word can only be divisive and hinder any approach towards getting an arrangement satisfactory to africa and to the whole world <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while the noble and learned lords question was very pertinent and should be taken into account the government must look at it in a wider sphere <e> <s> people are unemployed in other parts of the country because the rate burden on top of other tax burdens is making it impossible for firms to give the high level of employment that they could if greater efficiency and more stringency on spending came about <e> <s> it is not only a matter of local councils and the effect on certain authorities but the fact that the overall effect of high rates and high taxes is interfering with any attempt which can be made to reduce the high unemployment figures <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend recommend to his right honourable friend in regard to anticipating future problems such as this and dealing with them on an international scale involving more than one nation that when such matters are sent from the european commission and from the european parliament the council of ministers gives them a higher priority than it seems to have given them in the past for enabling regulations to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite certain whether my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is going to push his argument to the vote <e> <s> i hope that he does because i believe that we have heard a division of view which justifies the house as a whole coming to a conclusion <e> <s> i believe that the fundamental point made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter at the end of his speech was one that we ought to take into account <e>", "<cs> my lords before we develop a national inferiority complex on this subject when considering unemployment which is rife all over europe ought it not to be borne in mind that our schemes for alleviating it are becoming the envy of the other countries <e> <s> ought not the other side of the coin to be taken into account <e> <s> that is that per thousand of the population this country has more people in employment than has any other european country except denmark <e>", "<cs> my lords in coming back to the question may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware of any report anywhere which would justify a <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this question and answer are verging on becoming a constitutional matter <e> <s> is it not clearly understood that in the case of a report commissioned by a minister it shall be left to the minister to judge whether or not it

for improvement <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has not answered my question <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that most people would expect the extraction of oil to be brought about on merit to be efficient necessary and at the right price and not merely to provide employment <e> <s> employment should not be the main factor <e> <s> it is a very good factor which flows from successful exploration but that should not be the one that causes the amount of money to be spent which would be needed to exploit these new areas <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that although he has been congratulated on many sides for making the statement there could be a line of thought which would suggest that the statement is premature <e> <s> my noble friend obviously had nothing to say <e> <s> he had to admit that he does not know what it is all about and that many other things have to be produced before any real judgment can be formed <e> <s> is there not just a possibility that to

more efficient organisation for a very important part of our defence production <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the question as it stands could be looked upon in the minds of some

decision of this country and all nato members not to use force and to maintain peace and not the suggestion or idea of only one side <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware as i should have

unlawful or wrong in the conditions that then existed <e> <s> all they did was to negotiate an extra discount from the supplier <e> <s> if they had not been keen enough to negotiate that discount they would have done nothing wrong and so it would have made no difference at all to the government s contribution to the general payment <e>", "<cs> i apologise for speaking again but there is a vital principle here <e> <s> we may be dealing with a small clause and a minute amendment but it involves an important principle <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lady hornsby-smith in the sense that the

friend has done us a great service in letting us know of this but we now understand that the court has not yet given a final decision <e> <s> until such time as the appeal has been heard and the

<e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wedderburn in moving the amendment submitted that he wanted to make it clear to the layman <e> <s> we have heard only noble and learned lords on this point and so i come in as a layman <e> <s> as a layman i want to tell the noble lord that contrary to what he said his amendment makes it less clear to me <e> <s> without the amendment clause as it stands leaves the power and the discretion to the court which will have heard all of the points all of the evidence and will know all about it <e> <s> this amendment will put that in some sort of doubt <e> <s> what is a procedural irregularity it will be argued quite apart from the actual irregularity itself <e> <s> it would make a lot of good business for the lawyers because they could try to present every irregularity as a procedural irregularity which means that the courts full discretion ought not to be used as it will be used if it is left as it stands now <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that every reasonable person would have to concede that the statement he has made means that the prime minister has achieved better terms for britain that must be conceded with no help at all from the party opposite who did all they could to undermine her prestige and her general style when she was trying to get something even better <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the last supplementary question i should like to ask my noble friend whether he is aware that there is not such a thing as a compulsorily redundant miner <e> <s> it is only voluntary redundancy and jobs are on offer for any who want to move from one pit to another <e> <s> to give the impression that there is compulsory redundancy is not to state correctly the case as it stands at the moment <e>", "<cs> the speeches that we have heard so far on this amendment have all been very clearly anti-government and of course to kill the bill is their intention but i do not think the position as it stands justifies the kind of criticism we have heard or that which is contained in the amendments which have been put forward with that as their main intention <e> <s> the noble and learned lord in moving the amendment and he always does it in such a plausible way that even when he is wrong he frightens me to death because he sounds so effective said that this was nothing whatever to do with the abolition of the glc and the metropolitan boroughs <e> <s> we all know it <e>", "<cs> i have only just started <e> <s> the government since then <e>", "<cs> the noble lord ought to drag his mind away from proportional representation sometimes and i believe that this is an issue which is far enough away from that to be judged on its merits <e> <s> there is no doubt anywhere and i think it is accepted on the other side of this chamber that the nation by its vote instructed the government of the day to abolish this tier of government and they have set about doing it <e> <s> they have made it very clear how they are going to do it recognising as anyone who has played any part in government knows that these things have to be started very early in the life of a government otherwise they cannot be brought to fruition as was intended when the manifesto was brought forward <e> <s> it is the duty of the government <e>", "<cs> the noble lord opened with his typical show of smooth arrogance <e> <s> there was no need for that <e> <s> we have to listen to quite a lot of what he considers to be the truth put in his way <e> <s> if my style is not one that he finds acceptable that is a pity <e> <s> but it is the argument that i am concerned with and not the way in which it is presented <e> <s> i am saying that what is being done now in asking the committee to approve this paving bill is in accordance with the government doing their duty by carrying out what they told the nation they would carry out and what the nation gave them authority to carry out <e>", "<cs> i can see quite a problem developing if this attitude is going to be pursued <e> <s> as i understand the argument i see the point of it noble lords opposite are suggesting that because of what happened an hour and a half ago the thing is completely altered and we have got to pursue all the other amendments on the basis that this will not go forward as the government intended originally <e> <s> if that is the way they are going to deal with the other amendments then i think we shall get nowhere at all <e> <s> there are many stages through which this has got to pass before we can say whether or not the message of the first amendments defeat of the government is going to remain in that form <e>", "<cs> it is just as ludicrous to suggest that the bill as amended at this minute is as it will be if it becomes an act <e> <s> i thought that the arrangement made by the two front benches was that we should act on the assumption that more or less what the bill contains is likely to be the ultimate end <e> <s> but to work on the opposite basis can only be dangerous <e>", "<cs> may i make one short personal comment in order to keep a friendship outside the house if it is at all possible <e> <s> i believe in robust debate but i certainly do not believe in personal attacks which make for unpleasantness <e> <s> earlier in the debate when i was interrupted by the noble lord lord mishcon i interpreted part of his remarks as suggesting rather snidely something about my eloquence <e> <s> as a riposte i said that he exhibited a smooth arrogance <e> <s> it has been brought to my attention that the noble lord <e> <s> lord mishcon feels that there could be an interpretation put on the word smooth which is not pleasant <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while this house in committee yesterday did its duty according to its lights the result was to frustrate government action for which they had a mandate <e>", "<cs> under those circumstances is my noble friend aware that many of us will not be surprised if the other place quite legitimately as legitimately as our position will unfrustrate it in order to put themselves in the position where they can carry out their mandate and perhaps replace the existing words with the words put down in amendment no <e> <s> a by the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> if that happens it will not be the first time that the cross-benches have cut across the rigid partisanship which clouds an issue and have the real answer in the interests of the nation <e>", "<cs> i too hope that these words will not be added <e> <s> if they were included they could interfere with good management <e> <s> the example given by the noble and learned lord lord denning is very clear <e> <s> another example would be hotel kitchens where as part of good management it is expected that people will have their bags looked at before they leave the hotel kitchen otherwise all the staff in that kitchen are held responsible for any shortages which may arise <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord denning said the random check is accepted <e> <s> it is sensible <e> <s> if you have to suspect that somebody is a thief before you provide the necessary precautions in order to make certain that the hotel kitchen is properly run it will be to the disadvantage of everybody concerned <e> <s> these words would i believe cut across what is normal practice which is part of the test of showing that it is reasonable and sensible <e>", "<cs> we have had very sound advice from our legal colleagues <e> <s> the point ought to be reinforced by the committee noting the fact that one does not need legal training to see that clause is putting much too onerous a burden on the average magistrate <e> <s> one has only to read it to know that <e> <s> if it is necessary to consider all the evidence that is set out in the clause before permission is given for the search the person considering all the intricacies should be someone who is more competent than the normal magistrate <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning said that no doubt the magistrate would have his clerk beside him but the clause as it stands does not include even that protection <e> <s> it says that the magistrate sitting alone in his own house can make the decision <e> <s> we do not even have that protection <e>", "<cs> unusual <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house on what grounds he is able to suggest so confidently that a minister who introduces such technicalities as these necessarily knows what they are all about <e>", "<cs> i am rather confused <e> <s> i read clause quite differently from the noble lord <e> <s> i think that this is a protection for those who are employed <e> <s> this is to set up a commission to look after their interests at the end of the day <e> <s> the one month is written in to indicate that they have got to get down to looking after the interests of the employees very <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend allow me to intervene <e> <s> i really do think that the noble lord lord graham is absolutely wrong on this <e> <s> the effective thing is to have the commission set up and the commission having been set up they can then consult over whatever period they like <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady fisher said they took time to find out what it was all about <e> <s> i do feel that he ought to recognise as my noble friend tried to point out that with this particular interim measure there has been opposition to it expressed in very direct terms and if you leave it completely open-ended where you give the power to certain people to delay it virtually to have a veto on the setting up of the commission then you are not being helpful to the staff and the people who will be the victims or the beneficiaries of all that flows from the commission <e>", "<cs> this is the group of clauses which caused me to sit in on this committee stage <e> <s> i have a very clear view of this matter <e> <s> as my noble friend said there are precedents for it in normal circumstances <e> <s> the precedents are quite clear <e> <s> who is likely to disrupt the proper working of the bill when it becomes an act arising out of what has happened and not because of any prejudice <e> <s> i have a feeling that certain relevant councils may want to disrupt its working for political reasons <e> <s> it is much more likely that this will happen rather than that the minister will be dictatorial <e> <s> this is the ministers bill <e> <s> since he will want it to work he is unlikely to do stupid things by forcing upon enfield council or any other council people they do not want to employ <e>", "<cs> when purporting to read her amendment the noble baroness said <e>", "<cs> may i put a final question to the noble baroness who is very experienced as well as being very charming <e> <s> does she really think that any body which wished its response to be published would not itself have already published it <e> <s> is that not the way things work <e> <s> people who want their response to be published will take jolly good care to see that it is made public <e> <s> there is no need to put the state or the local authorities to the expense of doing what those bodies will already have done themselves <e>", "<cs> this is amendment no <e> <s> all over again <e> <s> that is precisely what it boils down to <e> <s> it is undermining the movement towards what is the main intention for which the government have a mandate <e> <s> it is the same argument all over again in another form <e> <s> i congratulate the opposition party on being persistent <e> <s> however on this occasion i think they are being too tenacious in view of the success that they think they had the other day on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my noble friend was asked whether there are any precedents for this <e> <s> i want to suggest to him that whether or not there are precedents the circumstances would justify setting a precedent if he is not able to produce any others <e>", "<cs> that is very helpful <e> <s> this is a step just a little further along than the example the noble lord has given but the circumstances would justify it <e> <s> officers deserve the protection that this clause gives them <e> <s> without it they are in a very invidious position <e>", "<cs> my lords is not my noble friend aware that immediately the national coal board provides the relevant facts from its special knowledge <e> <s> those facts are denied by individuals for reasons which are very much their own and are very partisan <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear from the statement and from the answers to questions that it was indicated that we would welcome a visit from mr gromyko it was stated in <e> <s> did his reaction give the impression that we are likely to have a visit <e>", "<cs> my lords rather than being led astray by the anti-profit question as put by the noble lord lord bruce of donington is my noble friend aware that extra profits invariably reflect extra efficiency and that it is extra efficiency that we want at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that as we have received three positive expressions of support it may well be helpful to have a negative <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that there will be acute disappointment that the government have capitulated so soon <e> <s> will my noble friend bear in mind that the house on second reading gave a majority of to show that the general line was the one the house wanted <e> <s> to capitulate merely on the result of the first amendment when we have still the report stage to go through is too early a capitulation to bring about happiness among the people who thought that the government were right <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the grudging acceptance of his statement by the benches opposite is so grudging that he has not got out of the problems <e> <s> could we still retain our final decision until the end of the report stage when the house as a whole could give its final decision rather than capitulating now so early <e>", "<cs> following the courageous example of the noble baroness speaking as a magistrate i wonder if i again as a magistrate may add a reaction to this amendment <e> <s> i have always looked upon the processes for getting justice and the machinery for getting it as a series of sieves <e> <s> one has the magistrates who provide the first stage <e> <s> the case goes through that stage then it gets to a higher court and eventually it gets to what will be the final one where the final decision is taken as to what in the ultimate the punishment will be <e> <s> i should have thought that one must take the judgment of the lower sieve as accurate having taken into account all the evidence rather than having to have all the evidence repeated again <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend think that the terms of the communiqu augur ill or well as regards the chances of spain with our support <e> <s> joining the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we ought to be concentrating upon the first amendment moved by the noble baroness because that is what is likely to be put to the test first <e> <s> i could not help feeling what a consummate actress the noble baroness was when she was moving that amendment <e> <s> she was quite superb in the way she presented a case which has no substance in it as though it was serious <e> <s> a lot of it was humorous in a way <e>", "<cs> my lords in a minute i will show the noble and learned lord what i mean by quoting <e> <s> the noble baroness spent a lot of her time saying that the timetable for getting alternatives could not be done in months <e> <s> she even went on to suggest that it would take years <e> <s> those of us who have been in parliament for any length of time know perfectly well that the timetable is what parliament makes it <e> <s> she talks about two years to do these things <e> <s> we know perfectly well that if the will is there and if the general desire to move forward is there on all sides it can be done in any period one likes to lay down <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i have just got on my feet <e> <s> next the noble baroness said that there were no precedents for this <e> <s> then she half gave way on that and said there were precedents for extending the life but there was no precedent for its happening before the main bill and what it stood for had been gone through <e> <s> but if we had to be tied so deeply into that as a precedent there never would have been a precedent in the first place <e> <s> in order for there to be a series of precedents to rely on in the future someone has to set a precedent at some time <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> then what did the noble baroness say <e>", "<cs> my lords what did the noble baroness say <e> <s> she said that even if there were precedents we ought to ignore them <e> <s> i took down her words <e> <s> she said that even if there were precedents they ought not to be followed so where is the sanctity of precedent in this argument having said that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am making perfectly clear what i have always felt and i have said it on all occasions because as i said in my last speech on the committee stage i have actually operated what is suggested and has been suggested by the government up to now <e> <s> there is no question of stepping into the dark and not knowing what will happen <e> <s> what we have suggested in the terms as i have understood them is that we shall go back and will operate more or less the system that existed before the local government act which brought the metropolitan boroughs and the greater london council into being <e> <s> i have reminded your lordships that or smaller authorities all of whose members were elected got together and had to organise the regional health service and that sort of thing <e> <s> all that has been suggested here is that we should revert to something that has worked <e> <s> it is not only words but something which has actually been in operation and worked successfully <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that it is obvious that the time has passed when the unemployment question should be treated as a party political football <e> <s> it is a problem which is shared by the whole of the western world and one that must be faced up to by all of the european countries <e> <s> but in this country per of the population we have more people in employment than has any other european country except denmark <e> <s> with that as a beginning we must have a partnership with other countries because this is a problem which faces all of us <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the dangerous statement that he made in answer to the supplementary question before the last one <e> <s> is it suggested that parliament by carrying out its proper duty of examining anything which is in the public interest does not have trust in either the officials or the ministers of the day <e> <s> does giving that kind of an answer indicate that there is some conflict of view as to what are our various functions <e>", "<cs> my lords could i re-echo the point that has just been made and was made by my noble friend <e> <s> does my noble friend the minister realise the dilemma of ordinary members of your lordships house when he makes a situation such as this <e> <s> here we have most eminent lawyers who really are expert in their field and one has in mind particularly the noble and learned lord lord denning putting a point of view very clearly and very forcefully <e> <s> then my noble friend with his brief i have no doubt well supported outside the chamber gives a completely opposite point of view in terms of what these words really mean <e> <s> i have no doubt that my noble friend on this occasion will not be pushing this to a vote but i would like my noble friend the minister to bear in mind that it is stretching ones loyalty if one can put it like that to the very extreme when we are asked to accept his explanation put as it always is with courtesy and clarity from his point of view but it goes so much against the practised and experienced voices that we heard exposing another point of view entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that despite his last answer his answers to the questions that he has been asked over the past few minutes are rather like a replay of what we had when we were considering whether or not we would sign the treaty of rome <e> <s> it appears that we present having agreement on lots of details but a great doubt about whether there is real agreement on fundamentals <e> <s> one would hope that the lack of affinity that exists between the ten is not going to be made worse by having an extension which would mean that the possibility of affinity is made even more remote <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that despite the questioning to which he has been subjected most reasonable and unbiased people looking at this problem accept the line being taken by the government as outlined by my noble friend in answer to questions as being both reasonable and sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that as privatisation is a very important part of the governments policy in order to avoid the misconceptions which have been shown in the questions which he has been asked so far ought not the profits to be shown in terms of profits per share <e> <s> until the return on a share justifies people investing we shall not get the investment and it is investment that we need in order to deal with the unemployment figures <e> <s> ought not that presentation to be looked at as a way of making quite clear to the public the true nature of the business dealings <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gladwyn certainly has second sight in having tabled his unstarred question at a time when something quite important was unexpectedly thrown into the general discussion <e> <s> i should have thought that the government would be very grateful to him for having this little discussion on it so soon after the weu announcement <e> <s> the secretary of state made his statement on it only on th october which is only a few days ago and here tonight there are comments being put on the record by people who certainly ought to be listened to the noble lord lord gladwyn who was one of our eminent ambassadors in a country which is vital in matters that can flow from this weu announcement and an ex-secretary of state for defence who is in a better position than any of us to have some sort of views as to how well based that announcement may be <e> <s> so this discussion is timely and i have no doubt that the government will appreciate the sharing of ideas at this very early stage <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very sound <e> <s> but i thought from the way he made the statement to begin with that the noble lord had doubts about whether or not it could be made to work as effectively as something new would <e> <s> i feel there is some advantage in reactivating something that has a historical base rather than adding as the noble lord lord kennet said to the many other organisations which over the years have been put into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the heat in the supplementary question put from the front bench opposite are we to understand that that leakage has only taken place over the past five years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put my supplementary question again <e> <s> has the leakage which has been admitted on all sides taken place only during the period of the conservative administration <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to understand that the noble lord is saying officially from the front bench opposite that he is prepared to consider compromise on the question of sovereignty because the same thing also applies to gibraltar <e> <s> are we to understand that the labour party is prepared to think in terms of compromising sovereignty in the falklands and in gibraltar <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to avoid our developing an inferiority complex about how we make use of the eec machinery <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that the criticisms from the opposite benches may well have been true four years ago but that the knowledge that we have the use that we make of the machinery and how we take advantage of it for national reasons are so much better now that the implications behind the questions put to him are unwarranted <e>", "<cs> my lords following upon the question put by the noble lord lord shinwell may i ask is this not the time to consider the possible benefits that could flow from there being a joint committee of both houses <e> <s> this is a matter that affects both houses <e> <s> rather than have discrimination and difference of view would it not be better that my noble friend the leader of the house should perhaps think along the lines of a joint committee so that the matter can be considered with the extra authority that such a joint committee would give <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but is my noble friend aware that in relation to the question that the noble baroness has just put although he says no decision has been taken a general indication seems to have been given that gas is to be expected to hang back in order to help the other authorities <e> <s> his answer has not cleared a way <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend saying that he thinks we can get away with it and that the other place could not <e> <s> is that the burden of his argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to respond to the compliment paid by my noble friend although we are on opposite sides of the fence on this occasion <e> <s> when this subject was again put on the order paper the thought crossed my mind almost instinctively that this was a case of physician heal thyself where we can as a second chamber carry out for ourselves what is our real function in terms of parliament as a whole <e> <s> our only power and we use it i think effectively and with good value to the nation is to give to another place time for second thoughts <e> <s> it is a great power and one hopes that when one gives that extra time it is usefully used <e>", "<cs> my lords i was listening intently because it is a vital matter <e> <s> it is perhaps the last chance that we have <e> <s> it is vital that we should listen to what it is all about <e> <s> of course my noble friend quoted the leader of the house in the other place <e> <s> in addition however when my noble friend reads <e>", "<cs> my lords the interjection is that they turned it down by one vote <e> <s> it was a case of votes which in terms of actual figures is twice the which has been quoted as regards the power we ought to exercise here <e> <s> so the other place turned it down in and it turned it down in <e> <s> in it turned down television and suggested sound broadcasting as an experiment <e> <s> the general impression left upon both houses then was that broadcasting would be looked upon as an experiment to form a judgment as to whether this outside media ought actually to come into the chamber of either house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is vital that constituents should know their member of parliament and should turn up to their meetings to cross-examine them to find out all there is to know about them but to do so through their own eyes and to make their own decisions on what they see and hear not what some editor with a camera chooses to let them see or some sound broadcaster chooses to let them hear <e> <s> that is the vital difference <e> <s> i am of the opinion not that it would be done deliberately that the distortion and the twisting that would inevitably come would have the effect of giving constituents a wrong view of what their members of parliament are really like <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not on the record that my noble friend the chairman of committees said that this is the lowest intensity that can be accepted so the lighting cannot go lower and it could in order to get a clearer picture go higher <e> <s> that is all i wanted to confirm <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that with a question so wide-ranging as this the answer he gave was the only one <e> <s> but is it not possible that special thought could be given to say the theatre where a subsidy is given back whereas the removal of vat would have the same effect without all the expensive bureaucracy that comes in the middle <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to being asked to produce evidence is my noble friend aware that the people who do this have admitted it on television in full view of millions of viewers and that there is no question about it <e> <s> whether it is right or wrong is another matter <e> <s> but the evidence is there from their own mouths <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the licensing act in relation to orders for extended hours at premises providing entertainment and in relation to special hours certificates <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that keeping in line is not a very attractive argument to people who believe that competition is the way to help everyone in bringing prices to a level that can be afforded <e> <s> keeping in line is not in keeping with the privatisation theory as i understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of any advisers who have greater experience and more prestige for giving advice to the government in the fixing of a price at which these shares should be put on offer than the advisers who were chosen and whose advice was accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that on the other side of the coin the result of the broad aggregate has been more jobs and that the percentage per thousand of the population has provided more jobs in this country than in any other european country except denmark <e> <s> is that not one of the results that we ought to keep in mind when offering criticism <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many people will agree with his reluctance to accede to the suggestion that on what were called privy counsellor terms the secret parts of the report should be made known to selected people <e> <s> apart from the very sound reason he gave that the more people who know about it the less secret it becomes from the parliamentary point of view it has always been accepted that it interferes with a full probe <e> <s> if selected people in a special position are privy to something it means that they cannot use that knowledge gained by that special privilege in a way that might be necessary in having the probe fully extended on such matters <e> <s> that has been the case with leaders of opposition in the past who have refused to accept invitations to share such knowledge because of the restrictions it puts upon them in doing their duty later <e> <s> i make that point simply because if we set a precedent of this sort on such a matter it may grow and for it to grow to any great extent may be damaging to what we call our free parliamentary society <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while his first reply is very commendable in many respects many people will hope that this obsession with computers and such-like will not interfere with paying real attention to developing the natural talents of reading writing and arithmetic in the young people of today <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour and after such a list of speakers it would not be unreasonable to think that all that should be said has already been said <e> <s> however there are still one or two points which ought to be covered <e> <s> the first one i should like to mention without wanting to over-egg the pudding is purely a domestic one to this house <e> <s> what is this motion doing on the order paper <e> <s> this motion has been treated by most noble lords as though it were a serious exercise that there might be in some high-class debating society where they put forward points of view <e> <s> it is not <e> <s> i do not complain about the motion because it gave my noble friend lord gowrie an opportunity to make an excellent speech <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord lord beswick for his tactical success in getting it on the order paper a clear blatant party political exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall willingly withdraw the congratulations but in order to show that i have not said what i have said without some thought let me give the chronology <e> <s> of course the conclusion could be wrong the long arm of coincidence is often present <e> <s> however the reason that i say it on the chronology is this <e> <s> we had a debate on th december and the speeches made then were identical <e> <s> almost the same speeches have been made today by the people who spoke on that occasion <e> <s> they did not have to do much preparation for today <e> <s> three days later on th or th december it was known that today would be the first television day and two days after that on th december the noble lord lord beswick got his motion on the order paper <e> <s> it may well be a coincidence but i submit that that added to the advice that i read from <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course entitled to his view and i very much enjoyed his contribution <e> <s> however he has been here a very short time i have been competing in this kind of thing for years and with the same people as i am competing with now <e> <s> therefore i can perhaps recognise things that my noble friend may not be able to recognise and that is quite understandable <e> <s> but in answer to my noble friend let me say that the chronology is quite true <e> <s> the debate was on th december the announcement that we would be having the cameras was on th or th december and the motion of the noble lord lord beswick identical almost to the other one went down on th december two days later <e>", "<cs> my lords i would rather not because of the clock i have already taken longer than many people wanted me to i am very well aware of that <e> <s> the national debt went up from billion to billion <e> <s> the interest alone on that has averaged out at something like between billion to billion a year and the total income over that same period from north sea oil has been about billion to billion <e> <s> the last government put north sea oil in pawn before we came to office <e> <s> i want to know how many times they will spend the north sea oil revenue <e> <s> they put it in pawn years ago now they want to use it again for investment in this and investment in the other just as though that indebtedness to which we had been committed before we came to government did not exist <e> <s> we should remember that when this government came to power in addition to the national debt the overseas borrowing had risen to billion <e> <s> during the five years we have been in office we have repaid half of that we have repaid billion <e> <s> is that something that ought to be remembered or denied when we hand out the credits and the criticisms of what happened in those five years <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that people listening to the statement and the comments upon it will have to come to the conclusion that both the courts and the government are acting in an exemplary way <e> <s> it is very good <e> <s> it is important that they are not trying to patch up this difference of interpretation they are going to bring in new legislation <e> <s> that is very good and it is an example that i hope people will follow <e> <s> but i was a little bit puzzled at the last sentence about the retrospective element <e> <s> i should hate the principle of retrospection to be brought in here <e> <s> i think retrospective legislation is bad and unfair <e> <s> although this may have elements in it which would perhaps justify a certain element of retrospection i hope the government will forgo that for the benefit of the higher principle of not having retrospective legislation <e>", "<cs> if i understand parliamentary language my noble friend on the front bench has made it clear that the government are not satisfied with clause either <e> <s> he has made it perfectly clear i think with the words that he used that they are prepared to look at this again and to take into account what has been said <e> <s> if that is the message that he intended to give i should like him to know that from some experience connected with small companies if the eventual bill does not convey the message which is contained in subsection the last subsection in amendment no <e> <s> it will not be satisfactory to me and i do not think it will be doing true justice <e> <s> subsection in amendment no <e> <s> says <e>", "<cs> on the basis of the

other directors should then be automatically discharged under the clause as it now stands <e> <s> under those circumstances would not the noble and learned lord agree that the situation ought to be either provisional or permanent <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the speech of the noble lord lord graham is one that ought to be listened to and one that i hope will be taken into account <e> <s> i think it was a pity that he spoiled it with just one sentence <e> <s> why did he talk about the government trying to smuggle something through as though somebody had made a wrong decision and was deliberately wanting to pursue it to the end because they had some special interest in doing so <e> <s> i see no evidence of the government wanting to smuggle anything through <e> <s> however i hope that they will take into account the excellent points that were made by the noble lord lord graham and indeed by the noble baroness lady fisher who comes from the same part of england as i do <e> <s> the speeches are full of <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of eec funding for any of this does my noble friend take into account that the evidence so far seems to indicate that there would be a better chance of getting eec money to help regional development than there would be for a central project such as this <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that a second reading be given to this licensing amendment bill <e> <s> i venture to suggest that this is an ideal amendment to existing legislation which should be dealt with under the private bill procedure <e> <s> it passes all the tests as to how the private bill procedure should be used <e> <s> it is modest in its scope it is easily understood and it merely brings england and wales into the same position as now exists in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very refreshing and i shall certainly see that it is underlined in my biography to have been accused of being unduly modest <e> <s> i do not think that in either house i have had that charge thrown at me before but <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the majority view throughout the country i think would be that people want to see a few of the taxes removed and not one or two more added to the long list of those which we have already <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the noble lord has said that it is generally believed that certain people have become puppets of somebody else <e> <s> to justify the generalisations that he is now making can he give evidence at this early stage in his speech as to where the powers of independence that the arts council has had since it was formed have been in any way reduced or removed <e>", "<cs> my lord before the noble lord sits down may i ask him why he did not keep his promise to me of minutes ago when he said that he would produce evidence to justify that the arts council had lost the independance granted to it when it was set up and to justify his charge of the council being puppets and such phrases as that <e>", "<cs> is my noble friend aware that many businesses that are looked on as being in trouble would not be if they could ignore the cost of servicing their capital expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee upon it <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question <e> <s> my noble friend may already have given the answer <e> <s> is every batch of blood in the bank tested <e> <s> the point that puzzled me a bit is this <e> <s> i accept what my <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the figure he has given includes subsidence from limestone workings as well as mining subsidence <e> <s> this is a problem in the middle of england which is just as acute <e>",

can be anything other than appalled at the events which have brought about this statement from the government today <e> <s> does she not agree that it is perhaps a pity that in the statement greater emphasis was not made of the fact that the official south african government have set up a judicial inquiry with the intention of finding out the true facts in detail so that we can then form a judgment not from an immediate reaction as given by all the media sources but from the investigation itself <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether his department has power to make the white paper compulsory reading for everyone engaged in education <e> <s> if teachers get their view from the jaundiced version that we have had from the liberal bench and the rather surprising one

hinted by the noble lord lord mishcon the minister had a general election in mind when he decided upon the committees timescale may i ask this question <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that minutes ago it was clear that the labour party also had an election in mind <e> <s> their official spokesman formally announced that if ever the labour party came to power it would take steps to ensure that all old-aged pensioners would not pay the licence fee and that those on supplementary benefit would pay a reduced fee <e> <s> the fact that that would cost about million was not mentioned <e> <s> clearly the labour party had in mind the possibility of an election and it sounded to me like squalid electioneering <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to support my noble friend lord mottistone on this the government are taking a line which gives the appearance that they are absolutely sure <e> <s> but i do not think that they are taking practical experience into account <e> <s> the practical experience is embodied in the words that my noble friend lord mottistone has used <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a lesson to be learnt from the glowing account that my noble friend has been able to give about antarctica <e> <s> that is perhaps because of the absence of people <e> <s> most troubles in the world are due to people <e>", "<cs> my lords although there is nothing wrong with the statement indeed it sounds a good statement all the schemes that have been mooted over the past seven or eight years have intimated that there would need to be an element of government guarantee some think that it should be greater than others do <e> <s> has it been made clear to the people who will be likely to be putting in their schemes by the end of the year that there will be no government guarantee at all <e> <s> that is not in keeping with the various suggestions made in the past when schemes have been submitted for general approbation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the two white papers and the statement will be accepted as a sober and constructive attempt to face up to this problem <e> <s> but in dealing with the more sophisticated ideas that are shown in the white papers will my noble friend see to it that we do not overlook the very important point of literacy in its earliest stages <e> <s> those of us who tried to operate the young worker schemes and who did so with some success found all too often that young people in for example the hotel industry who were bright and keen in every other respect were not capable of writing down the name of a newspaper or the name of a resident in order that people could be given service the next day <e> <s> that sort of elementary illiteracy is something which ought not to be overlooked when we are looking at overcoming some of the bars to getting people into work <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that not everybody would be critical of the associations decision to change the venue of this match <e> <s> something as traumatic as that needed to be done to draw attention to the depth of the problem which was growing almost every week that there was a football match <e> <s> i do not think that suggestions of it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him this <e> <s> while he has made clear that on party political grounds he does not like the present government does he think that the inhibitions the difficulties and the regulations which inhibit business doing its job today should be reduced or not <e> <s> will he make that clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord does not want to reduce them then <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon but there are some of us who do not feel it right that we should enter into the london controversy as we have no knowledge of london <e> <s> but the metropolitan counties are a different matter <e> <s> we have views on them from personal contact <e> <s> i should have thought that to avoid confusion the two amendments ought to be taken completely separately rather than my noble friends intervention on amendment no <e> <s> while the argument will be confining itself to london on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend give way <e> <s> one is interested in the metropolitan counties and what will flow from any alteration <e> <s> my noble friend is using the words may happen and he went a little further and said would probably happen <e> <s> will he tell me what did happen before we had the metropolitan county boroughs interfering <e> <s> it worked then what is the reason why it will not work in the future as it did in those days <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the real danger arises from the message behind the question of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> surely we must not give the impression that any board or group is sacrosanct and cannot be commented on by parliament <e> <s> that is the very reason for having a parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down does he not agree that the old adage of half a loaf being better than no bread is very real in these circumstances <e> <s> i believe that we won a good battle when we obtained permission for the officials of the community to have their vote <e> <s> one recognises the reaction in another place which at the end of the day will and should have the last word <e> <s> if this amendment has the effect of removing the half loaf that we have i cannot think that it is a wise way of wanting to use the powers of this house <e> <s> even at this late minute rather than put that at risk by having a vote on the record it would perhaps be better not to proceed to lose the half loaf that we already have <e>", "<cs> since my noble friend has said that in the light of the debate he is going to look at this again to see which words will figure at report stage i cross swords with the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal when she suggests that district councils and indeed the smaller authorities generally are not capable of dealing with the re-establishment of derelict land <e>", "<cs> there is nothing new in this <e> <s> they were perfectly capable of doing this before we had the metropolitan boroughs they did it and we have much evidence that they did <e> <s> my noble friend ought to bear in mind that we must not have bigger extra tiers to carry out something that was done most effectively and satisfactorily by the smaller authorities before the bigger one was put in their place <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is the turn of this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that he did not completely answer the noble lord lord cledwyn when he said that we are having a meeting of the officials of gatt <e> <s> of course everyone hopes that france will eventually join but are we to understand that if they do not join if they remain adamant the talks will go on or will they not <e> <s> if they are not to go on there is no point in the officials meeting <e> <s> could i remind my noble friend that there is some significance which should bring satisfaction to this country and to this government in the fact that all the other governments seem to have accepted a basis of improvement in the worlds problems founded upon the lines already being taken by our government and that the implied criticism from the front bench opposite and the sdp bench does not fit in with the acceptance of all the other nations that our line of approach to overcome the worlds problems seems to be the right one <e>", "<cs> i absolutely agree with that but in order to avoid any misinterpretation of what he has said can my noble friend not give a categorical answer to my noble friend lord molson <e> <s> i would have thought that we have given the reserve povvers to the minister because in the last resort he is in a position to put right any perverse result that may flow from smaller authorities having taken different decisions <e> <s> there has been so much criticism of the powers given to the minister that i would have thought we should advertise and show some pride in one of the things that he could do in order to overcome some of the feelings that have arisen on this subject <e>", "<cs> this seems to be a move towards pushing this to a vote but i wonder whether from our point of view if ought to be done <e> <s> it is not for me to give advice to the sponsors of this amendment but this is the sort of thing which ought to be brought up on report <e> <s> we have a large part of the bill still to go <e> <s> we can get many indications as to government thinking in this particular line of country <e> <s> if this is pushed to a vote now we inhibit ourselves in the sort of thing we can put on the order paper on report <e> <s> my advice if i can give advice to the sponsors of the amendment would be do not put it to a vote now but keep yourselves clear to do something about it later <e>", "<cs> that was perhaps a slightly emotional and unrealistic response to my noble friends speech <e> <s> i do not accept at all his interpretation of what was said and the grounds on which he based his words <e> <s> of course my noble friend will have a general idea as to what sort of criticisms would be made <e> <s> if the noble lord had served in government he would know that governments do try to anticipate debates particularly when they are putting forward a bill which they have to defend and explain <e> <s> i doubt whether any of the contributions that were made very effectively by many noble lords were very new in relation to what had been discussed when the whole of this bill was being put together <e> <s> it is not just drawn out of a hat and i would have expected my noble friend to come with something like a prepared answer to the obvious questions <e>", "<cs> i will withdraw the word acumen if the right reverend prelate does not find that to be a fair reflection of what he has in mind but he has just repeated the point and it is a very proper point if that is what he believes <e> <s> he believes that the local authorities are not so likely to be able to come to the kinds of conclusions that would be right or to give the guidance that he thinks ought to be given as would be this permanent authority <e> <s> on that i venture to disagree with him and i would hope that noble lords who have themselves served on local authorities might perhaps be on my side <e> <s> i have every confidence about the acumen and i now use the word as i would wish to use it and the far-sightedness and the desire of local authorities to do the right thing <e>", "<cs> i should have liked my noble friend and perhaps on these matters i talk with as much if not more authority than the noble lord he may be an expert economist but i do not know how many local authorities he has served upon to understand the inner workings and the way in which local authorities carry out their business <e> <s> however the criticism that i would put to my noble friend is this i should have liked him to go a little bit further in explaining how the expertise might be preserved <e> <s> i should have thought the one point that is generally accepted is that we do not want to disperse and lose the value of this expertise which is there <e> <s> i gathered he said that he had been impressed with the need to preserve it and that he would come along with some sort of suggestion when we get to the report stage <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way <e> <s> the noble lord

is the noble lord speaking <e>", "<cs> that is out of order <e>", "<cs> i agree absolutely with nine-tenths of what the noble baroness said and i think the committee on all sides would do so <e> <s> the importance of looking at the matter of disposal and collection of waste is very important to the nations health and general wellbeing <e> <s> the committee will remember we went through a period when as a result of the dustmens strike we saw rats running all over leicester square as a consequence of waste disposal not being carried out <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was perfectly clear <e> <s> he said that we must not have all these changes <e> <s> he said that we had made a lot of advances and that the present position is satisfactory <e> <s> if that does not mean that he feels we have reached the position where we need not bother and that there are no alternatives i do not know what it means <e> <s> i have had experience in local government over very many years and i believe that

baroness and i come from the same parish <e> <s> her experience is almost identical to my own <e> <s> any evidence that i could call would be the evidence that she would be in a position to call <e> <s> my answer very clearly from my experience in the west midlands is that i am satisfied that the joint authorities made up of the smaller local authorities were efficient before with the knowledge that was then available to all of them as it is with the present metropolitan boroughs and there is no reason after all these years to start throwing mud at the excellent service that those local authorities gave before and would be in a position to give in and beyond <e> <s> i believe that of the two alternatives the local authorities are most likely to produce the best results <e>", "<cs> if i gave the impression that i thought local authorities were working perfectly before i should say that i have never found any authority local or national which i think works perfectly <e> <s> all of them leave room for a lot of improvement <e> <s> that is the whole point of debate in parliament to find out where it is not working perfectly and to try to move a step towards improvement <e> <s> in removing this unnecessary tier i think we are doing just that <e> <s> what i am saying is that from my personal experience which covered to years where joint authorities made up of nine or ten local authorities got together to make decisions which covered a wide area it worked and worked well <e> <s> i defy the suggestion made by the select committee by the noble baroness and by the noble lord lord ezra <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble earl on that point <e> <s> those who have the authority and the power to dispose always have the benefit of the expertise that the laboratories give to them <e> <s> if they disregard the expertise and make no note of it that it questioning their acumen in being able to carry out their disposal powers <e> <s> i am saying that the fact that they dispose does not mean that they cannot engage the expertise <e> <s> they therefore have the knowledge which the experts make available to everybody including the people who dispose of it <e>", "<cs> but their knowledge is made available to those who have the disposal powers <e> <s> so it comes to the same thing <e> <s> that is what i am saying <e>", "<cs> i was very impressed by the theme of the noble lord lord jacques <e> <s> he said how important it was to be consistent <e> <s> consistency was the great word that he used <e> <s> there is a lot in it and i was very impressed <e> <s> this house must be consistent <e> <s> when we gave a second reading to this bill we said that we wanted to get rid of these intermediate tiers <e> <s> if we start by dealing with little bits and if we do the opposite to the message that came from the second reading debate we shall not be very consistent <e> <s> i would beg the committee to pay attention to what the noble lord lord jacques has said and to be consistent with its own decision when the principle was discussed and voted upon on second reading <e>", "<cs> of course it is and the noble lord as i have said made a most effective speech <e> <s> however it was on the wrong basis that is what i was trying to say <e> <s> the object of this committee stage is to share minds <e> <s> we are sharing minds and the noble lord lord jacques has said that we should be consistent <e> <s> i am saying the same be consistent and make the amendments consistent with the message which we gave on second reading <e>", "<cs> i think that this is the first time on the committee stage that i have presumed to come in on anything to do with london <e> <s> i have come in on matters concerning the metropolitan counties because i have had some experience of them and i am entitled to express a view on them <e> <s> however the reason i now come in on this matter is because i think there is a parliamentary consideration which has been raised

committee <e> <s> if i may say so it does not altogether satisfy me because i received the impression that the whole point of his contribution was that one is more likely to obtain better results if there is certainty if the knowledge that they are stabilised and firm is there <e>", "<cs> yes i accept that and i am rather inclined to agree with it <e> <s> that is why i adhere to what is in the bill <e> <s> what the bill is saying is that although we have had a general look at all other facets of government we have preserved for the time being the ilea which would seem to be what the noble lord wants <e>", "<cs> i only wish to ask the noble baroness whether she is not playing on words <e> <s> when as she put it you have gathered them together and when they are in the statute you have set them up <e> <s> what is the difference <e> <s> you have gathered them together and in the process of gathering them together you have set them up <e> <s> it is therefore a play on words to say

concerns the constitution <e> <s> i do not think it can be brushed off as the noble baroness brushed it off <e> <s> the evidence we were given by my noble friend lord home of the hirsel should be pondered on <e> <s> to go deliberately into conflict on a principle and a convention as important as this would be dangerous <e> <s> but i will leave that because what the noble baroness has done and she is so able in doing it is to use an argument against one point to pretend that another is as she said a sensible thing to do <e> <s> she rather suggested that the effect of the amendment is that an ordinary proper thing ought to flow <e> <s> it is that aspect with which i should like to deal that i have seen from practical experience <e> <s> i shall keep in the background the overriding constitutional point <e>", "<cs> i just wish to make the point first about the expert guidance which the separate committees want <e> <s> every time my noble friend lord molson has spoken in this committee he has shown <e>", "<cs> i shall but other people want to speak <e> <s> of course i shall give way i always do but i can save the time of the committee by saying that i believe that however one tries to smooth it over it could be almost another general committee similar to the one that the bill intends to remove <e> <s> that is not looking at it in a sensible way it is being partisan <e>", "<cs> the only reason i rise again is to say that i was right not to give way originally <e> <s> the noble lord did not want to ask me a question he wanted to make a speech <e> <s> now he has made his speech and he has confirmed every point that i tried to make <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will know that i have a lot of sympathy with the case put forward for the film industry <e> <s> with the noble lord and others i attended a committee where the case was put very strongly and effectively to us and so i have a lot of sympathy in terms of wanting to help that great industry which is a very important part of our countrys economy <e> <s> so there is no argument about that <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that to do justice to the two questions which the noble lord lord beswick has put on the order paper would require at least a two-day debate and that the circumstances would require information which will be available only about two years from now <e> <s> is it not a misuse of our question and answer procedure to put such wide-ranging questions on the order paper in this way <e>", "<cs> i so admire the noble lords energetic and enthusiastic style <e> <s> it is attractive and i can well see that it may be very attractive to many noble lords who have not made a final decision on these amendments <e> <s> but where he was fundamentally <e>", "<cs> i am not very good at rolling over and wagging my tail so i would agree with that <e>", "<cs> but the noble lord has said something which we ought to face up to <e> <s> the two houses are not equal <e> <s> the two houses have vital parts to play but in terms of authority we are not equal <e> <s> at the end of the day the other place is the sovereign part of parliament <e> <s> our function is and we have

<e> <s> i think it is vital that we should do that <e> <s> but to push it to the point where we use our voting muscle in order to upset what they have done as blatantly as we are doing with all of these amendments so that we virtually retain the central authority i believe will be damaging to parliament as a whole <e> <s> i also believe that it will interfere in the long run with the relationship which should exist between the two houses and the relationship which in the past has been very valuable because each has known its place without in any way rolling over and wagging tails as was suggested <e>", "<cs> i do not know how accustomed the noble lord lord somers is to dogs but if he can guarantee that every time he says sit <e> <s> they sit i would say that there was some point in his intervention <e> <s> i am saying that we are getting to the point where if too often we tell the other place that they have to sit when we say so and it is against their own will we will have a breakdown in the relationship of the two houses which will not be to the advantage of parliamentary government as we know it <e> <s> what i think is perfectly clear and cannot be denied <e>",

give her the same answer today <e> <s> i did not think that it was perfect then <e> <s> i thought that there was room for a lot of improvement <e> <s> i think that they ought to have done things better than they did <e> <s> i opposed my right honourable friend when he brought in the metropolitan counties <e> <s> i could not see that that was the right way then <e> <s> all the things that i

noble baroness lady david <e> <s> she said that we in this chamber could perhaps proceed to the extent that the amendments take us whereas the other place could not <e> <s> what did she mean by that <e> <s> it can have meant only that because we are not an elected body we can ignore the general view of the electors and the people of the country more easily than can the other place whose members

"<cs> that is out of order <e>", "<cs> i come to a different conclusion from the noble lord on this <e> <s> i have every sympathy for what he is asking to make the law clear and for everybody to know

community <e> <s> is it not still at the stage of a meeting of nations and that they have not yet got to the point where the affinity is such that one can talk as though it is one body making a decision <e> <s> is not slowness the only way of getting to the point where the whole thing will work <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware in support of what the noble earl lord perth has said that it is not only statements which are sometimes repeated when they need not be in this house but for example this week we had the answer to a private notice question in another place repeated in this house in the form of a statement <e> <s> if private notice questions and statements are going to be taken here that could well interfere with the general work that this house ought to be doing <e>", "<cs> my lords following the line that my noble friend lord molson has taken which i think is a proper interpretation of the atmosphere of the house i should like to say that in addition to the detail of the amendments there are other aspects which we as a house ought to take into account apart from the interpretation of the amendments and my noble friends answer to them <e> <s> we as back-bench members have a role distinct from that of the executive the government <e> <s> at this stage of the bills journey to the statute book that difference ought to be taken into account <e> <s>

available and have the right answers on some of the tricky questions that will arise on environmental and other matters of that sort <e> <s> we want to ensure that we get it right <e> <s> on the question as to what we want to attain there should be absolute unanimity <e> <s> but it makes a difference whether the oppositions solution as to attainment is the right one <e> <s> i do not share their solution but i share their aspirations <e>", "<cs> my lords precisely <e> <s> that is what i was trying to say <e> <s> but may i make it clear <e> <s> i am grateful for the intervention <e> <s> what i was trying to say was that it could well be that if they see the spirit of how we envisage the next step flowing from the fundamental changes that may make them more ready to accept our changes rather than removing them which otherwise would be the case <e> <s> i am talking now to those who believe in the changes for myself i do not think we ought to have made the changes they are not the right ones in the light of what we set out to attain when the bill first came to us <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> nobody knows better than the noble and learned lord that parliament is a talking shop <e> <s> parliament is not a good parliament unless it is a talking shop <e> <s> the general idea of parliament is for individuals of all types and from all walks to put their general view and for the government or the executive to take the best of it and discard the worst of it <e> <s> the suggestion that i am making to the noble lord is that if having won some battles in the fundamental changes already made one is then going to go into dictatorial detail one may not be able to retain that advance which one thinks one has made <e> <s> that is all i am saying <e> <s> there is all the difference in the world between saying well have nothing whatever it is no good the noble baroness trying to wave me down <e> <s> i have tried to wave her down often and she has never fallen for that

after having made one speech not me <e> <s> but at the end of the day i hope we can maintain the spirit that was <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that most people would expect both him and the government to disregard the mud that is being thrown even before the bill is on the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that everyone would expect these appointments to be based not on sex or on party allegiance but on ability <e> <s> we hope the government will keep to that criterion <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the bill upon which these questions are based is not yet a statute and that it is still within the realms of this parliament to discuss these matters in debate <e> <s> is it not wrong for questions to be asked on such detail which cannot possibly be answered when the bill is in the process of going through the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that people would be surprised and it is inexplicable that an opposition which puts unemployment figures on the top of its list should be so sour and lukewarm about the help that the government have been able to give in that particular field <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend seemed rather hazy about what is likely to flow from the important question of the provision of engines <e> <s> would it not be reasonable to expect that at any rate the joint cars that were sold in britain and europe contained the british constructed engine and those sold in the rest of the world perhaps contained the honda engine <e> <s> my noble friend said that the discussions were still going on <e> <s> i hope that in those discussions as a minimum he will push for what i have suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord somers i have a great deal of sympathy with what i know the noble lord lord strabolgi has in mind <e> <s> we want to maintain and if we can improve the arts in this country but i do not think for one moment that the noble lord who moved this amendment expected it to be accepted <e> <s> he knows that in purely parliamentary terms as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has said it is too open-ended <e> <s> you do not know to what you are committing yourself <e>", "<cs> my lords i can well understand the voluntary organisations being apprehensive with all the propaganda that has been thrown about about the awful things that will happen to them if this bill goes through <e> <s> i can understand their being apprehensive and worried <e> <s> but this amendment and particularly the speech of the noble baroness reflected once again that they have no confidence that the smaller district authorities particularly outside london are capable of voluntarily and willingly getting together and working out a scheme <e> <s> my noble friend lady faithfull obviously feels that from the words she used and the examples she gave when she made her trip north <e> <s> i have lived in the midlands the whole of my life and i do not accept that <e> <s> i am convinced that whatever political differences there may be in various parts in the interests of their areas the smaller district authorities are capable of getting together and will do so <e> <s> in the past before we had the metropolitan counties or the greater london council they got together on many things <e> <s> i do not believe therefore that my noble friend the minister ought to undermine the general confidence in the whole of the bill by this one section giving the impression that it has to be mandatory that the confidence in their doing what is right is so weak that it has to be written down in the form of a statute <e> <s> i believe it would undermine the whole spirit of acceptance of this bill as a whole and not only with the voluntary bodies that we are talking about in this particular amendment <e> <s> i believe that we must be consistent if we want this bill when it becomes a statute to become effective and helpful to the whole of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i have never heard the convention that is being suggested by the noble baroness put seriously before <e> <s> the amendment is on the marshalled list <e> <s> the meaning behind it is clear to those who understand the subject <e> <s> to suggest in either house that one has to sit through the whole proceedings when there are so many demands on ones time is a convention

both sides <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the position that if the media really want to play a part in these humanitarian endeavours they should give headlines to the point brought out in this question which must be news to many people who would not have thought it possible <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while the house has great respect for the noble baroness lady burton there would be reluctance in the country i believe to have any more criminal offences added to the statute book <e> <s> nowadays it is almost criminal to wake up in the morning <e> <s> there is no need to add to that otherwise the free society that we talk about will soon be non-existent <e> <s> will the minister put the criminal offence answer to the problem very much at the bottom of the list and not at the top <e>", "<cs> my lords at the bottom <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that most people will support the sober and realistic attitude that she is adopting on behalf of the government <e> <s> i think that the same people will deplore the blatant anti-american attitude which is contained in questions being tabled these days from the labour benches <e> <s> the american are our main allies as we are theirs and this undermining of mutual confidence can do nothing but harm for the future peace of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords in those circumstances i formally move amendment no <e> <s> aa as it stands on the marshalled list today <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord rochester cannot think it is very important or he would want to pursue it at the earliest possible moment <e> <s> the reason i am moving an amendment to which i have not put my name is the silence from the official opposition benches <e> <s> the dog has not barked and i cannot help feeling that the tactics behind their refusal to propose the amendment are perhaps more important than the amendment or what will flow from it <e>", "<cs> because i believe that there are such tactics behind this that they <e>", "<cs> my lords my tactics are very clear <e> <s> my tactics are that this house shall carry out its proper function that it shall examine the proposed legislation and revise it if we think that is <e>", "<cs> my lords those noble lords who were in the house will remember that at the end of the committee stage i personally placed on the record my apprehension as to this possible development <e> <s> noble lords who were in the house heard me say at the end of the committee stage that i hoped that the withdrawal of many of the amendments from actual voting did not mean that they were merely to be kept in reserve to waste time on report and third reading <e> <s> that is on the record <e> <s> i rather suspected from the general attitude that i had seen adopted that that might be happening <e>", "<cs> my lords that very intervention from the noble lord the leader of the opposition is part of the tactics <e>", "<cs> my lords now that i have my prologue on the record i am happy to confine my remarks to the actual amendment itself <e> <s> i believe that this in its way is an important amendment <e> <s> it is important because the time factor insists that the doubts that it seems to express should be cleared away at the earliest possible moment <e> <s> up until this amendment was put on the marshalled list i had understood that the government had made arrangements to safeguard the future of employees who will be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend a question <e> <s> would it not be helpful if we could know more of the details of the negotiations which she has said are going on <e>", "<cs> my lords why not <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that the government have taken every possible step to bring the staff and their unions around the table and i am sure that as we have gathered from my noble friends speech in the absence of such contact the arrangements made are fair and equitable so far as we can see today <e> <s> i also accept that if this amendment as it is now worded were accepted it would introduce almost insurmountable problems in giving effect to the bill when it became a statute <e> <s> for all those reasons i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i were inclined to be controversial which i never am i think i would open up on the basis that if we were in another place and acting under certain rules we could be accused of tedious repetition because these arguments if one looks at them are precisely the arguments we have had on every major amendment that we have discussed <e> <s> it is another way of trying to replace the glc and the mcc with something almost the same but marginally different <e>", "<cs> my lords i am on a very narrow point <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will be able to come to an arrangement with the noble earl lord cranbrook on this <e> <s> i must say with my experience in parliament and business that i am a little loth to put in a fixed date if it can be avoided <e> <s> if it cannot be avoided for good reason i understand that <e> <s> but i find that if you write a fixed date into a statute in this case st march for all sorts of reasons that one cannot envisage one may not be in a position to come to a right conclusion in time <e> <s> if you have written in st march you are really hidebound and may be giving yourself unnecessary problems <e> <s> if it can be sorted out it is not a point on which we are far enough away from each other to quarrel i would myself try to avoid putting in a date which might be an embarrassment for reasons which at this moment we cannot envisage <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the general view <e> <s> again i hope that this can be sorted out <e> <s> the difference is so narrow and everybody seems to want the same thing <e> <s> the only contribution that i want to make is this <e> <s> i think that by leaving in the words that the amendment seeks to remove you are likely to make the report itself more responsible than it would be without them <e> <s> if it is known that what could flow from the report could affect whether or not the secretary of state will make the order then in the making of the report there is just a chance that the report will be in a more responsible form marginally than it would be if it were felt that the report would not <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask a question which could be of help to the noble lord lord tordoff and which might meet to some extent the point made by my noble friend lord cranbrook <e> <s> if the words in question are left in it would mean that the ministers discretion will be limited to having good reasons for disagreeing with something in the report <e> <s> this means that he would have to justify not agreeing with what he was being asked to do by saying it is this in the report which i do not think would allow me to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i just want to come in in defence of parliament <e> <s> the noble baroness seems to think that if by statute a document is laid before parliament then that is the end of it <e> <s> it means nothing <e> <s> once it is there it is up to parliament to use all the facilities that it has to comment on it if there is anything in it worth commenting on <e> <s> i do not think that the noble baroness should leave it on the record that the words literally mean that copies of the scheme will be laid before parliament and nothing could flow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come in <e>", "<cs> my lords without accusing anyone of anything as the noble lord the leader of the opposition said and bearing in mind that the whole purpose of the amendment as explained by the noble lord lord tordoff is to have a letter sent to the noble baroness lady stedman put on the record i am glad that my noble friend lord home with his <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not agree more <e> <s> it is a pity that this matter has been introduced at the tail-end of an innocuous amendment <e> <s> however the noble lord who raised it is a significant figure <e> <s> it is clear from the words used by the noble lord the leader of the opposition that the matter is to be looked into <e> <s> i believe that any reactions from all parts of the house should be on the record at the earliest stage <e> <s> i am merely saying here that i do not believe that rules or conventions have been broken <e> <s> but we have gone pretty near to it <e> <s> i hope that no words used by the noble lord lord shackleton will encourage this development to go even further and perhaps over the line <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot understand why the words are so limited in view of the arguments that have been adduced by the noble and learned lord lord silkin and by the noble lord lord irving <e> <s> how can the relevant authorities which they would leave in the bill co-operate if the officers do not <e> <s> that is exactly like saying we will let you fight with both hands provided they are tied behind your back <e> <s> i should have thought that if it was considered desirable that there should be any cooperation among local authorities for these sorts of reasons it would automatically and should automatically include the officers <e> <s> my experience is different to that of the noble baroness <e> <s> i have not found a reluctance among officers when they have not been surrounded by all the political overtones that exist here to do their duty even though in terms of their own employment or position it has been marginally to their disadvantage <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should be grateful if he would clear up one point which puzzles me <e> <s> in the noble lords exchange with the noble lord lord mayhew at the beginning of his speech he seemed to be distancing himself from the official amendment proposed in another place by his party <e> <s> was he then speaking as a peer in his own right or was he speaking as leader of the labour opposition which would make his statement official <e> <s> it would be helpful to know exactly what the situation is <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the whole burden of the excellent campaign of the noble baroness who will speak for the consumers <e> <s> is it not rather more important to ask who will listen <e> <s> is it not the experience of all of us that private enterprise is more able to listen and act than are the nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that anyone who understands procedure would recognise that the proposals of my noble friend lord cockfield are as stated just proposals <e> <s> until they are examined by everybody likely to be affected by them would not the government be well advised to remain as the noble lord lord ezra said muted on the topic <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i do not know how the noble baronesses lady birk and lady stedman the noble baroness lady fisher is in a rather different category can support these amendments and keep a straight face <e> <s> the noble baroness lady stedman put it perfectly when she asked is london a special case <e> <s> through all the hours and days that we have been debating this bill the opposition and the alliance benches have been saying that london is a special case <e> <s> the whole of their argument for getting something done has been based on the fact that london is special and should therefore be dealt with separately <e> <s> it is hardly fair that they should now suddenly switch the argument round and use it as a weapon to beat the government for being neglectful <e> <s> i have not accepted that london is all that much of a special case <e> <s> but your lordships house did so and voted accordingly <e> <s> now very properly we must accept the decision of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend keep in mind the very wise suggestion made by the noble lord lord cledwyn as to the necessity for any proposals to be put on the table beforehand so that proper consideration can be given to them by all members <e> <s> will my noble friend keep it in mind that many people will think that the prime ministers instinct in not wanting the conference that was suggested and which now has to take place was very sound <e> <s> is there no way of reverting to the old traditional practice of the diplomatic sources sorting out the points of difference before the heads get together instead of giving the impression of a total breakdown at the top by attending without having made the necessary preparation to achieve progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little puzzled <e> <s> the amendment contains the words for the avoidance of doubt <e> <s> putting in those words has created a doubt that was never previously there <e> <s> it is perfectly clear to everybody who knows anything about this matter that the regional tourist boards are non-profit-making non-statutory and fall very clearly without any doubt within the scope of clause as it stands <e> <s> i believe that it would be a mistake to indicate by these words at this stage that there was a doubt in the matter when there was no doubt at all <e> <s> it weakens rather than strengthens what the noble lord wants <e>", "<cs> well my lords the english tourist board was wrong as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord henderson is not on the right beam on

get through both houses over recent years <e> <s> he said very properly that these dealt with the tip of the iceberg and that they were only tiny and insignificant in their scope <e> <s> the reason

recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is not a lone voice on this side of the house <e> <s> i imagine that most people who have any understanding of business at this level would agree with the minister absolutely in his statement <e> <s> this seems to be a case where any final decisions ought to be made by the people who are running the company <e> <s> it is right that they should seek all the information that they can obtain <e> <s> it is right that the government if they have any interest at all should let that interest be known to the company <e> <s> but the final decision ought to be made by the company which is in full possession of all the details regarding employment and the general techniques it adopts <e> <s> i suggest it would be deplorable if we started allowing

retail shops the noble lord has owned or had to operate <e>", "<cs> just a minute the shambles arose because the inspection of the terms of employment in shops was unfairly applied <e> <s> on one

the noble lord lord graham has proved himself to be over the years that we have been in parliament together should think for one second that an amendment such as this would be inserted in a bill by any responsible parliament <e> <s> why should this be granted only to the people who work in the retail trade <e> <s> the report would contain an assessment of whether they have had their right to worship interfered with what their remuneration is whether their working has increased prices or affected them and about the interests and wishes of the consumers <e> <s> if this one industry was

official records which one hopes they have confirm or not confirm the evidence and the facts brought by my noble friend in her opening speech <e>", "<cs> my lords are there any records <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not question my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely said while agreeing with the points just made that i would not question my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any need to spend a great deal of time on this amendment because i understood the noble lord lord graham to say that he intended it only as a probing amendment <e> <s> he really wanted it discussed <e> <s> therefore we need not spend a great deal of time on it <e> <s> if we are going to probe it and have something on the record we ought to accept the common sense of the noble and

council <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the theatre is one of our biggest industries both as regards employment and exports that this library is the seed from which most of the theatre productions flow and that to allow it to be damaged or disbanded would be a real tragedy in the long term <e> <s> will he nudge the arts council to continue the very modest a year to avoid this happening to an outstandingly important industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that to have a policy on anything does not mean that one has to promise legislation <e> <s> it is just as clearly a policy to announce that one is not going to introduce legislation it is equally effective <e> <s> as i understand it a policy is not always calling for new statutes <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether it would not be a good idea to let the television companies know that they may be wasting their money <e> <s> we may decide not to continue televising this house and the change would involve a waste of money if and when we came to that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in circumstances like this the one thing that is a killer is uncertainty <e> <s> for that reason the suggestion to put a deadline on people who say they might be interested to make their decisions early in march is absolutely right <e> <s> from the point of view of the workforce the ownership of the shares comes second a very poor second to having an efficient competitive industry with which to work and in removing the uncertainty you are moving in that direction <e> <s> people who are interested in delaying it for what are often pure party political reasons should be completely ignored <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i must say that after listening to the comments so far on these various amendments and from my years experience as a member of a local authority i honestly do not see dangers of the magnitude that has been expressed <e> <s> however from the experience of the last to years i believe that some sort of guidance which could take the form of the right sort of code is necessary <e> <s> local authorities have done things which have been shown not to be in the interest either of the local authority itself or of the nation as a whole so something ought to be done <e>", "<cs> i am glad of that intervention because i was going to

speech on his bill next wednesday i cannot see anywhere in clause anything which even alerts one to thinking in terms of whether the statute is giving anybody permission to charge <e> <s> i see no reference to it or any possibility of it having anything to do with the clause to which the noble lord was speaking <e>", "<cs> it is the last words of the noble baroness that disturb me <e> <s> i do not see what those comments have to do with clause <e> <s> if there is anything in her comments that is based upon newspaper reports and general allegations which as i understand it have no foundation

allegations the noble baroness must know that even in the roundabout way she refers to them to do so from the dispatch box gives credence to something that may not be true which is not very good <e>

is my noble friend aware that as his answer indicated there is some contradiction in this house asking the government to encourage the museums to use their own initiative to increase their fundings

more important than the technicalities of the law and the argument about what words should be used <e> <s> the minute that the people of this country think that the united kingdom courts are not supreme as regards matters that happen within the united kingdom then i believe that we risk weakening ordinary peoples acceptance of parliament with all its statutes <e> <s> i believe that there is a risk of that happening <e>", "<cs> let it go on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with every word said by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> it is a pity that a matter which is of supreme importance as was said on second reading should be dealt with at such a late hour both on second reading and now <e> <s> i believe a fuller house at second reading might have given a different view than the one we are saddled with now <e>", "<cs> i gave notice that i would oppose the question that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> in order to avoid any confusion i shall not push that to a vote because i feel that having obtained a second reading tiny though the attendance was when we gave the bill a second reading the convention should be adhered to of not interfering in committee with clause when it is a fundamental part of the bill <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will read the debates when the act was still a bill and passing through the house he will see that it was my noble friend lord eccles who placed it on the statute book as the minister in charge <e> <s> he will find that the whole burden of that act was a tidying up of four establishments which did not

clearly that people who are in work have been infinitely better off over the last six years than they were before <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord st john of bletso i come in to this debate without having my name on the list of speakers which means that it is my duty to be brief as indeed he was <e> <s> i come in because there is one point which i do not think has been made <e>

question of what the french charge internally to industry or to anybody else is something of a red herring <e> <s> the lesson that we have to learn is that the french have proved that energy from nuclear power is cheaper and as efficient and we shall neglect that knowledge at our peril <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask my noble friend whether it was not inevitable in the face of the wishy-washy reaction on monday of european foreign secretaries who refused to do anything by way of economic sanctions to help that america would have to think in terms of defending its citizens when libya had proclaimed that it would murder american citizens in any part of the world in which they were found <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the question asks what her majestys government are doing about increasing exports <e> <s> is not that a matter for private enterprise exporters to deal with and it could well be that government intervention would be counterproductive <e>", "<cs>

noble lord says held this vote <e> <s> is it the one standing outside the victoria and albert with placards trying to prevent the trustees doing what they think is right <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness give way <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down i should like to know where i stand <e> <s> she used the word we on so many occasions in defending the bill <e> <s> is it a private members bill or is it an official opposition bill <e> <s> the noble baroness is the spokesman for these matters <e> <s> she is speaking from the dispatch box and from the front bench <e> <s> is it a private members bill sponsored by the noble lord lord jenkins or are we dealing with the official opposition who believe that the trustees should not have these powers who believe that the commitment should be made by the chancellor to cover all of the expenses that might occur <e> <s> i think we ought to know where we are particularly since the noble baroness has already indicated a point which i do not think is fair when she said that what had happened at the victoria and albert museum had already shown that it was losing out <e> <s> the report from the trustees issued only last week said

ask a question of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that people are more likely to risk their capital if they can feel it is still the policy of the government to reduce taxation if that risk proves to be successful <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend very quickly went over a most important point <e> <s> is he aware that unless he defines what is a reasonable time his motion will give permanent authority for this house to be televised <e> <s> if we want to be certain that it comes back to the house when time can be allocated to it the period after which it has to be brought back again should be included and it should not be left in the hazy phrase a reasonable length of time unless that is defined <e>", "<cs> my lords but may i <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend may well be aware that it is my view that we are accepting something almost unwittingly on this very important point <e> <s> my noble friend talks about the house eventually deciding <e> <s> unless he can guarantee that those who may want the house to give consideration to the matter will be given parliamentary time for a decision to be made it is in no way effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if anybody has tried to use question time to spit out propoganda it has been the noble lord who has just asked a question <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be constructive and positive sometimes to concentrate on employment as against unemployment <e> <s> is it not a fact that per of the population there are more people in employment in great britain than in any other european country except denmark <e>", "<cs> i must say that i have not followed the proceedings of the committee on this point and i have only just come into the chamber <e> <s> i have such a respect for the noble lord lord graham solid reliable but i must say i have never heard a more ridiculous speech than the one he has just made <e> <s> i mean that <e> <s> if in a time of crisis we would not expect the bbc to act responsibly which is what he said whether or not their actions are based on any <e>", "<cs> my lords the few words that i want to say are in no way critical of the four speeches which have been made on the passing of this bill but i feel a certain concern about the way the house as a whole has dealt with the third reading <e> <s> i have been in your lordships house some years only but i have seen a deterioration even in that short time in what i think and i hope it has been inadvertent has been the misuse of our ability to produce amendments at third readings <e> <s> it is very proper that this house which is usually the last port of call before a bill become an act should have that ultimate power that the other place does not have of moving amendments on third readings <e> <s> however i think it is up to us to use that power a little more circumspectly than we have been using it today <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kilmarnock and my noble friend lady cox and the special amendment that had to be drawn from the government all of those <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the existing training facilities to do with tourism has any thought been given to the possibility of conjoining the efforts that are to be made with regard to the new litter teams that are envisaged so as to help tourism <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend is talking to his right honourable friend about the imbalance in rates between scotland and england will he press upon him that what we desire is for the scots to have their rates brought down and not for the english to have their rates put up <e>", "<cs> what the minister said is borne out every day with people who have to run businesses particularly small businesses <e> <s> when one is thinking of opening a department in another town particularly when people have to handle money and one has to pay for the stock which is to be put into the shop one must be satisfied with the people who will be handling money without day-to-day supervision because one cannot always transfer top responsible management to a new department in another town <e> <s> the employer must feel that he has some sanction which will ensure that the business is being properly run as regards the cash that comes over the counter <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> the noble lords interpretation of what i said bears no relation at all to the words that i used <e> <s> what i said and i repeat it was that i believe that a contract made between the employer and the employee is all that is necessary <e> <s> they both agree that in order to get the efficiency that they both need they are prepared to pay for discrepancies which common sense shows are there <e> <s> there is no question of fining anybody <e> <s> the kind of interpretation which the noble lord put on it shows the bias with which he approaches this question that the employee can never be wrong but that there are dirty employers who always want to be wrong <e> <s> that is the wrong attitude here and the noble lord reflects it far too often <e> <s> but he must not reflect it by misinterpreting my words <e>", "<cs> i find frustrating the lack of realism shown by the noble baroness whom i so much admire in respect of this matter <e> <s> was she being told the noble baroness asked that by putting in statute that there should be four weeks holiday this was putting it in a straitjacket <e> <s> if this was the only worry that small employers had to contend with there would be no problem <e> <s> the noble baroness has to remember the innumerable other instructions in statute or near statute that have to be takan into account <e> <s> when we consider all of these we find that it is the straw that breaks the camels back <e> <s> it works much better when employer and employee have a relationship which means that they can make a mutual arrangement and dispense with statute especially when that statute may not accord exactly with the type of work they perform <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will not be diverted <e> <s> this is another example of statutory obligations that make it almost impossible to run many small businesses <e> <s> i am certain that it can be dispensed with without any hardship to anyone <e> <s> i am convinced that people in employment nowadays are well aware of their rights and that they are capable of negotiating a mutual agreement that will be much more suitable than a quickly drawn up statute passed through this house <e>", "<cs> i am not saying that we should have a statute that says people cannot have a holiday <e> <s> i am saying that they can have a holiday that they have mutually negotiated <e> <s> they know more about it than anyone else <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while one understands not wanting to interfere with the domestic arrangements of the commission the government ought to be interested up to the point of seeing that the nationality balance is kept for that is not always the case in all of the commission appointments or at least it does not appear to be so <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that anyone who travels to other countries on occasions and then comes back here would not recognise this country if he listened merely to the description of it given by the noble lord lord beswick <e> <s> it bears no relation to the true life and the true reactions of our people at this time <e>",

detriment of the pupils <e> <s> since he is responsible for the pupils and not for the local authorities what is he doing to try to get local opinion in those areas to put the matter right in the

question which has just been asked by my noble friend <e> <s> the more restrictions that one puts on allowing real competition without government interference the more it is bound <e>", "<cs> my lords

deal with all the industries <e> <s> i think they have interfered with full employment and i believe their interference in carrying out their job has in many instances done a great deal of harm <e> <s> i am not saying that on specific occasions they cannot perhaps right a grievous wrong in an individual case but the overall interference we have had is i think on the debit side rather than on the credit side as regards wanting to help the revival of our industrial strength <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not pretend to understand the technicalities behind this amendment <e> <s> i have hardly understood a word about the x factor and so on taken in the context of the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me i have sat with him for years in another place and here <e>", "<cs> may i just answer this question first because it is rather personal <e> <s> i have sat with the noble lord and gone through this sort of exercise again and again and if he will allow me to say so and i have a great respect for him we are friends outside as well as inside it is not what he says that i pay attention to but what he does <e> <s> and what he has done in relation to this bill leaves me in no doubt that he does not want this industry privatised and all his moves are in the direction of trying to prevent its being privatised <e> <s> certainly i will give way <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to the noble baroness on that i concede that the noble lord now sits on a different bench from that when i first knew him <e> <s> i have not seen such a change as the noble baroness describes but i am prepared to kill the fatted calf for him yet <e> <s> i have not seen in his actions or in the way he approaches the politics and the economics of this country so great a change as the noble baroness seems to think has taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords will the regulations be applicable to vessels owned by nationals other than british nationals <e> <s> one can understand that policing can be carried out in regard to boats that are berthed in this country but what will be the position regarding foreign owners of boats <e>", "<cs> the factor that makes this special is that there has to be premeditation <e> <s> many other implements are used which are frightening the public now and with very good reason <e> <s> it could well be that one could have the weapon and various items but not necessarily with the intent of using it for a purpose that falls foul of the law <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while it is right that the contract that is entered into as to what the artistic directors can and cannot do and receive in those capacities should be rigorously looked at it is wrong that the artistic directors in this case should be blackguarded because they have produced a success <e> <s> the return that they have obtained under the terms of their contract could not have been as high as it was if they had not produced successful productions and rather than blackguard them for doing it should we not encourage them to continue producing successes of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just ask a procedural question concerning the noble lord lord dean <e> <s> both noble baronesses said that this was an intricate statement and they found it difficult to comment on it even when they had the statement in front of them <e> <s> i understand that <e> <s> however it looks as though the noble lord lord dean who sits on the back benches has got a copy of the statement <e> <s> is it fair that the back-benchers on one side should have a statement when back-benchers on the other side do not <e>", "<cs> it is very difficult to be against the arguments that the noble lord who introduced this amendment has put forward <e> <s> if it is the view that things could happen if certain people were prepared to move from the proper standards one can always in theory find a good reason for saying that nothing is safe anywhere at any time <e> <s> i therefore do not and cannot argue against the particular points as they have been put by the noble lord and supported by other noble lords <e>", "<cs> if one has in mind computers i do not think that legible is the right word <e> <s> i think that something a little more in keeping with what we mean by the use of a computer ought to be found if at all possible <e>", "<cs> or even the word identifiable if it might be identified by picture by computer or whatever it is <e> <s> i do not think legible is the right word <e> <s> doctors would not have a chance <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend able to say what the position will be if they do not reply to the letters <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that saying the government will attempt to seek agreement falls short of using the powers mentioned by my noble friend lord bethell and what we could do <e> <s> is my noble friend in a position to say that if there are no replies or if the replies are unhelpful we will use the powers referred to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord cledwyn said that on this occasion this house ought to be objective in its approach to this and we would all agree with that <e> <s> on the basis of being objective and weighing up the merit of the argument that we have heard so far there are two special matters which we ought to keep in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i was a little puzzled by an answer which he gave to an earlier question when he said that a previous incident had not been inquired into because it was obvious what had happened <e> <s> surely somebody looked into it and there is some report somewhere even though there was not a public inquiry <e> <s> may we have a little further explanation as to why if an incident happened there was not an inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend tell the house what british representation there is on the fao investigatory team <e> <s> are they putting on pressure to see that all the facts that concern this country will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> i would not have thought that there was any need to give advice in statute as to what a senior police officer should have regard to <e> <s> i feel that there are certain dangers in trying to find words that separate the risks <e> <s> the noble viscount referred to the wicked man who may disguise himself <e> <s> let us suppose

<e> <s> does she come within the ambit of the possible discretion that the police officer should use <e> <s> it may be that the wicked <e>", "<cs> that is precisely my point <e> <s> if somebody wants to effectively disguise themselves that does not necessarily mean that they have to put on funny clothes <e> <s> there are many ways of doing it <e> <s> but even when they have put on the clothes the police officer forms some kind of a judgment from what knowledge he could have he would not know entirely <e> <s> similarly with dyed hair or the growing of a beard the fact that we make reference in a statute does not make it easier for him to recognise the situation <e> <s> at the end of the day if we accept the amendment it is still left to the police officers discretion having taken this point into account whether he feels that there is a danger involved <e> <s> i do not like writing unnecessary words and giving too much guidance from the benches of parliament to the people on the street who eventually have to do the job <e>", "<cs> i do but i am saying it is already covered by normal usage <e> <s> we have no need to spell out the detail that the police officer must look for <e> <s> we ask him to use his experience and knowledge to have regard to the general situation <e> <s> to write in these words does not give him the power it helps him to arrive at a decision as to whether the power should eventually be used <e> <s> i am saying he does not need that guidance from the distance that parliament always is from the actual incident that would be involved if there were any disruption <e>", "<cs> i accept absolutely the message given by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> we want to preserve the right to process <e> <s> i do not know how many noble lords in their political career have processed <e> <s> i have often done so <e> <s> when we had elections in the midlands where politics come from the heart we processed <e> <s> sometimes we were advised not to walk in procession past the labour club and the labour procession which came afterwards was advised not to run past the conservative club because of the risk of the things that may grow out of that due to all the emotions that were there <e> <s> but the ordinary procession we must preserve <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon said it is part of our way of life and it is an event attended by many other people <e> <s> it it not that sort of procession that we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my noble friend may well have satisfied the legal purists particularly on the other side of the committee but i do not think that he will have given much satisfaction to the general public <e> <s> the general public particularly those who are the victims of these persistent professional interventionists in processions should like to think that someone who is seen to be doing this persistently ought to have it dealt with as a misdemeanour by the court itself <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the principle of the green belt is not necessarily weakened by ironing out many of the quirks that have been seen to exist with the boundaries as they now stand <e> <s> it may well strengthen the principle if the obvious quirks as i call them are dealt with rather than if we look upon every appeal that is granted as being a retreat when in point of fact it is really doing what is sensible in the changed circumstances of the time <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend think that so long as there are more tenants with a vote than there are landlords with a vote we shall ever allow the private owner to invest in a private enterprise building scheme for renting on the scale that we need <e>", "<cs> my lords before directing all our criticism towards the government and the size of the legislative programme should we not occasionally look at our own weaknesses <e> <s> it seemed to be recognised when i first came to parliament years ago that when a point was made in this house it was not repeated by other noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before i tickle the conscience of one or two who very much practise what i am describing cannot we establish a position that used to exist whereby there is no need for six or eight noble lords for whatever reason party political or self-indulgence to go on repeating one point <e> <s> if that was done we could possibly overcome the logjam that we are grumbling about so much today <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord williams is not disagreeing with leaving in the words or agreeing <e> <s> that is something which is fixed <e> <s> but the or offering seems rather nebulous and uncertain <e> <s> offering in writing <e> <s> by word of mouth <e> <s> what does offering mean <e> <s> agreeing means something <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams seems to produce a neater paragraph than the one set out in my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to raise a point which perhaps my noble friend will keep in mind on amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i understand the general advice but not the specific <e> <s> can one not give specific mention as an example of what one means by ones general advice <e> <s> would that be in breach of what one is allowed to achieve <e>", "<cs> not for the first time i think the noble and learned lord lord denning has given the committee very wise advice <e> <s> there is no doubt that the kitchens and the provision of food as in hotels and other establishments which do that can be separated and can be seen to be separated from the general hospital service <e> <s> that is why i think the government were right in specifying that the food-providing section should be included in the bill <e> <s> however when that is extended to the wards the laboratories and the private offices that are part of the general office administration much more thought ought to be given to it as a general proposition rather than adding it on as an ingredient in this bill which was not originally intended to cover that scope <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord saying that he would be prepared to accept a regulation saying exactly the same as the words that he wants taken out <e> <s> if that is what he is saying he appears to have said it a minute or two ago why not leave the <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a little premature to have questions asked and answered on the provisions of a bill that has not yet been approved <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if all sides agree that immigration rules are necessary most reasonable people would say that in applying those rules it is much better that they should be applied at the beginning rather than at the end of the process when expense and difficulties have been allowed to accumulate <e> <s> with regard to the question of whether or not people feel inferior when they have a visa i wonder whether the leader of the labour party felt inferior when he had to have a visa attached to his passport before he could enter india a month ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be wrong but the questions that the noble baroness has asked so far seem to bear no relation whatever to the statement <e> <s> they are general arguments on the whole picture <e> <s> should we not confine our questions to the statement itself when it has been passed on to us from the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if the opposition want to debate the subject they can have a debate by giving up their own time <e> <s> they are allocated time and they can choose to take this subject <e> <s> i rather suspect they will not use their time for it because my noble friend has repeated an excellent statement which reflects so much credit on the government that the opposition are not likely to want to emphasise that <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that quite apart from the public accounts committee people in every street in the land invariably have knowledge of some flagrant abuse of the social security system as it stands <e> <s> is he also aware that those self-same people are asking today what the government are doing about it <e> <s> this questionnaire is a way of doing something about it which need bring fear only to people who are abusing the system <e> <s> those who are not abusing the system have nothing to fear <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware that people hope that he will not be put off doing his duty by silly talk about massaging figures for electoral reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords the opening sentence of the speech of the noble lord lord ezra caused me some disquiet <e> <s> i had not intended to intervene although i have a point that i want to put to your lordships <e> <s> his opening sentence was in effect that we have had our referendum it was decided and that is that as though that was the end of the matter and we automatically go forward with everything that now flows from brussels and strasbourg just because in the referendum at the time we had a majority <e> <s> i hope that that will not be the approach of this government or any other government when they are dealing with these matters <e> <s> that was far from being that

into account the parliamentary interchange between the two houses <e> <s> i think on this occasion it is very important that we do that <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has correctly pointed out the marginal nature of the difference <e> <s> the general principle the general view that this house included in the bill in its earlier stages has been generally accepted by the government <e>

suggests <e> <s> if the minister was committed to making a report of his decisions it would have to be done as a report with all the paraphernalia within departments that goes with a report <e> <s> i do not think it is as simple as the noble and learned lord suggests and in most cases it would put an unnecessary burden on the department that had to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not a good example of how something we do not like and do not want could have been resisted if we had not given up the veto in favour of the qualified majority <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that his amendment made the wording more precise <e> <s> i do not believe that is a proper description of what the amendment would do <e> <s> there would be rigidity every month this would have to be done <e> <s> that rigidity would create a lot of unnecessary work <e> <s> taking all the amendments together we are very near the point to which the noble lord lord bruce of donington objected on the last amendment the point where particularly if one felt in a liverish mood it could be deemed an unnecessary criticism of the bank to the extent perhaps of being marginally offensive <e> <s> at the moment as the words stand regular intervals mean having to be kept informed when there was something to be informed about <e>", "<cs> may i just finish this point <e> <s> to say that you do not trust the bank to interpret regular to mean that and to tie it down to monthly is a rigidity that stretches behind the point <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord and i agree <e> <s> it is in the judgment of the bank to interpret the word regular whereas the amendment says monthly tying it down <e>", "<cs> i am suggesting that the words that the noble lord has in his amendment make the bill offensively rigid <e> <s> as it stands it recognises the responsibility of the people who have to decide the regularity of reports <e> <s> a bank is no different to running ones own business <e> <s> where the board of any business which meets at irregular intervals says that it wants a weekly or a monthly report and that this shall not be at the discretion of the executive who has to give it that can give the impression that you do not have a lot of confidence in your executives <e> <s> it can imply that you do not think they can decide that sort of thing <e> <s> i do not know what my noble friend will do <e>", "<cs> i suppose one can put what interpretation one likes on the word regular but the point of my intervention is that you are letting the bank itself decide the necessity and to decide what is regular <e> <s> i think that is right <e> <s> if you have confidence in it to do the job you have given it to do it ought to be in a position to decide just that <e>", "<cs> i think that all that needs to be said has been said by the noble lord lord obrien but i get a little disturbed by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> he said it is right that there should be direct contact with

<e> <s> they have contact with both <e> <s> as regards the possibility of ending their membership and not wanting the bank to be in a position to give any indication on that they are the ones who would know whether it is desirable to dispense with their services <e> <s> the noble lord lord obrien talks with greater authority than anybody as to whether or not the bank of england is likely to be sensitive but i think that once again this is to some extent by implication downgrading what we think is the role of the bank and we ought not to do that <e> <s> it is bound to be detrimental <e>", "<cs> surely the noble lord recognises that his amendment as it stands is unnecessary <e> <s> if parliament wishes to know the reasons it does not have to wait for a report from anybody <e> <s> parliament has the power to ensure that it gets the reasons <e> <s> if the noble lord is concerned that parliament should eventually know in the circumstances that he has described parliament will know <e> <s> these words are therefore unnecessary and there is no reason for the implication which the words carry even with the explanation which the noble lord has given since parliament has all the power which he wants it to have <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him in view of the general tenor of his speech and his special experience whether he subscribes to the criticism voiced by the right reverend prelate that the existence of the independent lay members is a disadvantage and particularly that the appointment of an independent lay chairman is the wrong way of approaching the matter <e>", "<cs> this is a great place to live and learn and to be demoralised particularly when we have someone so lucid and expert as my noble friend lord elton <e> <s>

either in the other house or this and i have sat in one or another of them for years <e> <s> if the convention is as the noble lord has said then i shall apologise but hope that heed will be taken of what i have said <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one point on which i think we ought to try to clear our minds <e> <s> the noble lord lord wigoder said that it was the house of lords that was not able to fulfil its complete duty as he saw it by using statutory instruments <e> <s> i accept what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i do not see how we could carry through the amount of legislation we do without having the assistance of statutory instruments <e> <s> however i think that he was being perhaps a little insular in thinking that the present system does not give protection against the wrong thing being done <e> <s> whether or not under a convention or a rule the house of lords cannot amend or turn down a statutory instrument the other place can <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> i thought that it had the power to amend too but apparently i am wrong and i withdraw that remark <e> <s> parliament has the power to reject and so the fact that one part of parliament does not have the same amount of ultimate influence as the other part does not remove the point that parliament has the power <e> <s> that is what we are part of and that is where the power is <e> <s> i do not think that the benefit of having the statutory instrument in terms of saving time space and printing should be criticised in the way the noble lord did just because the ultimate power of parliament having the last word is vested in the other place and not in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords will the point raised in this question be included in the general reappraisal as to the framework governing the national health service which we are told is now under consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it never has been the case nor would it be sensible to say that every report on every matter would automatically be published before it has appeared <e>", "<cs> my lords are we not going against the agreement that we made on a previous occasion when we interpreted our standing orders and decided that on report after the minister had replied there would be no more detailed debate <e> <s> if we are going to have that we shall never get through the bill <e> <s> i think that we ought to have some self-discipline <e>", "<cs> my lords at the beginning of the report stage can we know where we stand <e> <s> there should be no question of saying anything which would cause the minister to reply again <e> <s> advice was taken and the agreement accepted on all sides was that on report after the minister had spoken there should be no detailed debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lords remarks are in breach of our decision as <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the question from the liberal benches about gambling being the thin end of the wedge can my noble friend tell us how much of the income from the biggest gamble of all premium bonds goes to the national health service and other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is a feeling in some quarters that the united kingdom is not as adept at obtaining grants as are some other parts of the community especially france <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the effects on the balance of trade is my noble friend in a position to say what the output per man has been over the past five years <e> <s> has that figure gone up or down <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the exclusive nature given until the end of april is in conformity with common sense <e> <s> it is not always the best policy to put a company up for sale by auction <e> <s> as regards getting the terms and the price you require to give that exclusive offer is much the best way of getting the type of answer that is most desirable <e> <s> at the end of april another situation arises <e> <s> but until then the line being followed seems to be in accordance with common sense and with normal practice in such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may refer to that section of his speech in which he said that the government executive had interfered with criticism from the press and other media <e> <s> is he saying that the government ought silently to accept unfair and damaging criticism when they believe that it is to the detriment of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend think that that very satisfactory position will continue in the next months or is the budget too imminent for him to make a forecast <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the sour grapes reaction of noble lords opposite will not be shared by most people <e> <s> they find this particular grape very sweet <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether it is a minority or a majority but i know that many families do <e> <s> i know that enough families do that for me to say that we ought to take their views and needs into account but i do not think there has ever been a gallup poll upon the point <e> <s> i know that in the part of the country where i have always lived and still live sunday is a day when people go to the pub in a family group more than they do during the week <e> <s> it is within my knowledge that our neighbours as well as ourselves as a family get into the motor car and travel into the country to have a drink in a country pub or go to a local hotel <e> <s> it is within my knowledge that most people i know do things a little bit later on a sunday than on a weekday so that where two oclock might on a weekday fit into the normal pattern of lunch when the family is together it is different on a sunday <e>", "<cs> the noble lord confirms the reply that i gave to my noble friend <e> <s> i do not know the precise figures <e> <s> i do not think it matters <e> <s> i do not believe that on every piece of legislation we pass we have to work out whether there is a majority of one in the country for or against it <e> <s> our job is to reflect the normal pattern of life of the country and to try not to obsruct it too greatly <e> <s> if one is creating an obstacle to the normal pattern of life one risks bringing the law itself into contempt because people will want to subvert it if they think that what they are doing is right <e>", "<cs> am i to assume from what the noble lord has said that he is going to vote against the bill as a whole <e> <s> i say that because if there is any point at all in the argument that extra hours will encourage drunken driving which none of us want and which anyone with any sense is opposed to the rest of the bill means that from monday to saturday people will have the entire afternoon <e> <s> therefore i find difficult to understand how one can produce an argument that that danger is there but that it only happens on a sunday between the hours of two and three in the afternoon <e>", "<cs> that was a very adept and satisfying reply from my noble friend <e> <s> he said that it was a modest and uncontroversial bill and i agree with him <e> <s> within this modest and uncontroversial bill amendment no <e> <s> is certainly a modest and uncontroversial amendment <e> <s> if i have the agreement of the noble lord lord peston and the noble earl lord attlee because of the tone of my noble friends reply i would beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however i understand that that is not agreeable to the noble lord lord peston <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend <e> <s> it is a matter of translating the real meaning of parliamentary exchanges <e> <s> if i interpret correctly the exchanges this afternoon it looks as though the government could not support in any way amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> but the language used by my noble friend and it was as far as he could go in view of the commitment in another place was that the government do not recommend in quite such strong terms against amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if that translation of what was meant is correct the suggestion which i was making to the noble lords who joined with me in putting down amendment no <e> <s> i was to be grateful for small mercies and to say that we recognise that we shall not get the support likely to make amendment no <e> <s> a winner <e>", "<cs> i am certain that the government are right from the point of view of how the licensing laws are applied <e> <s> like the noble lord i was a licensing justice for something like years until age ruled me out <e> <s> i had to preside over many cases of the kind to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> i never felt that it was my job as a licensing justice to provide the complaint <e> <s> i felt that it was my job to adjudicate upon the complaint by the people who were being injured perhaps by noise for example <e> <s> if there is a disco or something of that kind on licensed premises which is a nuisance to the surrounding area and there are complaints to the police the police have to do something about it <e> <s> they do something about it normally by trying to get the noise stopped at once <e> <s> if the noise is persistent the police with the support of the local residents who are the victims lay the complaint and the licensing justices have to listen to both sides in the case and adjudicate upon it <e>", "<cs> it is my fault i suppose but my noble friend still does not have my point <e> <s> indeed the department he represents did not have the point when i argued this by letters <e> <s> i hope we can clear it up <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may press my noble friend a little further <e> <s> i should like to ask him to look at the practicalities of the issue <e> <s> let us suppose that a company or an individual is contemplating building a leisure centre and calculates its potential before spending the kind of money involved <e> <s> it may be that a good part of the money must be borrowed from the bank which must be satisfied that the necessary income from the investment will be met <e> <s> we are talking of bricks and mortar and not something which can easily be put up and pulled down <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is clearly a genuine feeling throughout the country that the national health service should be treated fairly and up to a point generously <e> <s> does he know that the nation is aware of certain groups which are trying to turn that feeling into a weapon of party-political propaganda <e> <s> does he agree that his right honourable friend should take that into account so that the conclusions to which he comes will be based upon efficiency and fairness <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that the supplementary questions so far seem to bear no relation whatever to the question on the order paper <e> <s> as regards the question itself is it not highly dangerous to ask the government to commit themselves on what another government may think in circumstances which cannot be identified <e>", "<cs> my lords the mover of this amendment said that he hoped that the government would perhaps look at it between now and third reading to see whether they could find words which would cover the problems that he has outlined <e> <s> is not the minister in a position to say that the government will look at this and see whether they can find such words <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend and the government are satisfied that this is a good deal under all the circumstances for the company and for the workforce will he give a complete assurance that he will not allow any interpretation by the european commission to sink it <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said that it is up to the orthodox churches to make this decision <e> <s> what for example has the greek orthodox church to do with the date we celebrate our easter <e>", "<cs> my lords while no one would wish the government to come to an ill-considered decision may i ask whether my noble friend is aware that the apparent delay in making a decision gives the impression that there are vital differences within our own departments <e> <s> if that is so and they are allowed to grow by further delay it will mean that the decision whenever it is made will not have quite the same force that it would have had if it had seemed to be more acceptable generally to all the departments concerned <e>", "<cs> i was disappointed to hear what the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside had to say <e> <s> i remember that he and i battled together when there was a suggestion of separating parliamentary control of scotland <e> <s> i believe that he recognised as we then argued that there was one unit and that we should not separate parts of the united kingdom on the basis that the benefits that they could receive were different <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me what good it would do to publish these figures at the end of the year when it is too late to do anything about them whether what has been done is for good or for ill <e> <s> the only people who understand these matters will carry on making guesses about what is being done and its results whatever figures are published months after the event <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he is not playing the game and that i think he knows that he is not playing the game <e> <s> he is making the longest speech in the debate at this hour in the morning when all other speakers have confined themselves to the length of time that was suggested would be reasonable and proper <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord that many of the points he is making are committee and report stage points <e> <s> he is not playing the game <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene on an important point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that wages had been reduced <e> <s> did he mean that the overall wage payment by companies had gone down or that the individual wages of the operators had gone down <e> <s> i find the latter hard to believe <e>", "<cs> my lord this amendment is the best example that i have seen to justify having amendments on the third reading of a bill <e> <s> that is a procedure which is allowed in this house but not in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask my noble friend this question before he replies <e> <s> if something is attached to the voting paper which is nothing whatever to do with it it ceases to become a voting paper <e> <s> if one has a voting paper in the booth in the normal way one does not have a propaganda sheet connected with it <e> <s> a voting paper with an attachment to it which alters its character is not a voting paper within the meaning that the bill intends <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend pay special attention to the question asked by the noble lord lord wyatt <e> <s> if the situation is allowed to fester on as it is now it could well stop other people who would want to bring investment to this country in order to service europe <e> <s> that makes it a problem for the nation quite apart from an immediate problem for dundee <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend likely to come to any conclusions from reading mrs castles <e>", "<cs> diaries <e> <s> will he take care to read dick crossmans diaries also so that he can get the proper balance on that particular see-saw <e>", "<cs> in a sentence so it will not be lost perhaps i may repeat the point made by my noble friend lord st john of fawsley <e> <s> when we pass the amendment as i hope we will how do the government envisage that people who have had the instruction will be tested <e> <s> the multi-racial nature of schools will make that difficult <e> <s> that difficulty should not mean that those who are christian in their approach and who have that teaching cannot be tested in some way <e> <s> what thought have the government given to that point <e> <s> it will help in future amendments if we can have some indication <e>", "<cs> i do not think that my noble friend lord beloff was at all remiss in asking the mover of the amendment to give us his view of the bill as a whole and the national curriculum in particular <e> <s> at the committee stage of a bill one ought not to look merely at the words on the marshalled list <e> <s> one has to try to take into account the motive behind the words <e> <s> i believe that it is essential that the noble lord should answer my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down it may help the debate on the following amendment if he advises his noble friend that when he puts down an amendment with the idea of it being a probing amendment which is healthy and good he ought to say so <e> <s> this was presented as a formal amendment intended to be part of the statute <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware as my noble friend who tabled the question made clear that the taxpayer has been bitten in the past and as a consequence there is a need for the utmost vigilance to ensure that things that are offered in the future are the right ones <e> <s> ought we not to be careful not to sour the atmosphere so completely that we frighten off people who may have genuine products which could bring good to this country in terms of employment and general profitability <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords whilst i apologise for asking a second

give <e> <s> he spoilt it a little by saying he was sad that there was no english word with the same meaning <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams said that he did not know what the word entrepreneur meant either <e> <s> i do not have much difficulty <e> <s> by entrepreneur i mean two easily understood english words the risk takers <e> <s> they are the ones who are prepared to take the risk <e>

decides whether the business is a success or failure in terms of employment and profitability <e>", "<cs> that is their decision <e>", "<cs> my lords if a citizen does not adhere to the law passed through parliament in order to avoid paying his proper dues that is his decision <e>", "<cs> my lords with the possible exception of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby this second reading debate has been delightfully free of viciousness and spleen <e> <s> it has been constructive and noble lords have expressed views which are quite out of keeping with the fire and brimstone which the media said

her answer <e> <s> the parents would <e>", "<cs> it is my instinct that the noble lord lord stewart of fulham let the cat out of the bag about what was behind all the amendments that have been withdrawn and with which we have not had to proceed <e> <s> he was wanting to suggest some kind of inconsistency in regard to our wish to enlarge parents choice and how it would fit in with the testing period <e> <s> how he presented the argument showed the real feeling behind all the amendments <e> <s> as i detected it from opposition speeches they want to whittle down parents choice <e>",

further what she means in terms of getting the bill through to its next stage <e> <s> my noble friend said that she will take into account what was said by her noble friend in moving these amendments <e> <s> my noble friend said that she will give further thought to them <e> <s> does she mean that she hopes that at a later stage the provision can be inserted in the bill in some way which will perhaps make specific the points that have been made during the course of the debate <e> <s> is that the interpretation to be put on what she said <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the very clear innuendo behind the question put by the noble lord on the front bench opposite is there any evidence at all that the national audit office enquirers asked questions to which answers were refused <e>",

with under the european treaty <e>", "<cs> noble lords may remember that i have always opposed this kind of amendment quite apart from the bill and the reasons connected with the bill that have already been given <e> <s> it is easy for the committee to pass a measure setting out by statute the need for a report whether or not there is anything to report and for that to become an act <e> <s> once that measure is on the statute book it means that people have to produce such a report <e> <s> that entails expense and manpower <e> <s> it entails all kinds of investigations from which nothing

separate <e>", "<cs> my lords can we be sure that trained policemen are not being used to read the computers who could be better employed on the beat <e> <s> are civilians being used for that purpose

noble lord who has just spoken carry considerable weight <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will be in a position to assure the committee either that the risks outlined do not exist or that he intends to do something which will eradicate any risks which he may have to admit exist at the moment <e>", "<cs> i support the very reasonable point raised by the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> having spoken to his right honourable friend if it is agreed that no sale will be allowed that ends the matter <e> <s> however if he returns with what he considers to be a reasonable answer which does not completely close the door but leaves it marginally open i think that this committee ought to have a chance to debate that proposal before we accept it <e> <s> if it were not satisfactory he may not have my vote and that is important <e>", "<cs> i believe that the undertaking given by my noble friend as regards a previous amendment covers this amendment <e> <s> i believe that this is one of the aspects he had in mind when meeting the points on the previous amendment about whether information should be made public <e> <s> if at the end of the day the position is that which some members of the committee prefer that the information is not available at all for general distribution then even with this amendment the name on the register would not apply <e> <s> i believe the undertaking given by my noble friend covers this amendment and i hope that the noble lord takes into account the point which he made before he moves against what was suggested in the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> in addition to the specific point made by my noble friend i must say that i hope the committee will turn down the amendment on the general procedure aspect <e> <s> when amendments of this type are moved it is always suggested that we should have an annual report from whoever must do it as though the making of an annual report is merely a matter of writing a letter in two minutes and that is all there is to it <e> <s> as my noble friend said it puts an unnecessary and extra burden upon the officers who have to write such reports <e> <s> further it may well be that in so doing one is taking time from other jobs which are more important and which ought to be concentrated upon <e> <s> i do not like the procedure <e> <s> i do not believe that an annual report just for the sake of satisfying someones doubts on a matter which is not likely to happen is a good way to prepare a statute <e> <s> for that reason apart from the detailed ones outlined by my noble friend i trust that the committee will not accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the discussions which my noble friend has said are taking place have industry and commerce been consulted in those discussions <e> <s> those who are having to run the show find it difficult enough when one government put their oar in <e> <s> if of them do so we may well be interfering with the whole of the business community in the european community <e>", "<cs> almost by accident we seem to have discovered a procedure which i think will help everyone in trying to arrive at the real purpose behind the bill <e> <s> however it must be said we have arrived there by accident <e> <s> can we not have when there are many intricate details which need explaining as shown by the amendments on the marshalled list a detailed explantion of the clause as my noble friend has just given which anticipates some of the queries that may arise <e> <s> it would save a great deal of time <e> <s> this in no way precludes members of the committee pursuing their arguments in greater detail rather they would be pursuing them as part of a picture which is generally understood <e> <s> as i said we have arrived accidentally at this position <e> <s> indeed i had begun to think that there was quite a lot in the arguments put forward by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> when one wants to arrive at the right conclusion there is bound to be such controversy <e> <s> however when i see the explanation inserted into the total picture as my noble friend has just done it makes the whole concept much easier to understand <e> <s> it is a procedure we have dropped on by accident <e>", "<cs> paragraph of schedule seems to explain the position <e> <s> i return to what the noble lord lord monson said <e> <s> if the matter gets to the magistrates court and the magistrate finds out that one spouse has an income of a week and the other has a part-time income of or a week is the magistrate in a position to allocate according to income each spouses responsibility as a proportion of the payment of the debt <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume that the government have made up their mind as to their priorities <e> <s> it may be that they want to obtain the best price that they can for this asset and that is fair enough <e> <s> they have built up from nothing an asset which now has a value <e> <s> if they want to turn that asset into money now because they are not in a position to expand it any further and make it more valuable there is nothing wrong with that <e> <s> however should they want to sell at the best price i hope that they are not thinking of cluttering the transaction up with too many conditions and terms which will weaken the freedom of those people who will have to diversify and expand in the future which as my noble friend has said is something to be hoped for <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from my noble friends answer to my noble and learned friend that it could be that the two houses may come to different conclusions and as with television we shall have a different view <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case would it not <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> is the minister saying that if when the matter is reported to the house the house comes to a different conclusion it could be a separate decision <e> <s> if that is so his answer to me does not appear to

power to the secretary of state to do his duty <e> <s> the amendment says <e>", "<cs> does the noble earl recognise that if this protection were given to scotland it would have to be given to wales and perhaps to parts of england or does he think it can be separated <e>", "<cs> my lords ought we not to wait until after the american presidential election before we presume to start telling the americans what their defence and foreign policy should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i react against this amendment <e> <s> it is the old story of not having confidence in the impartiality of the secretary of state whoever he may be <e> <s> i cannot imagine anyone likely to hold that office who in operating the statutes would blithely ignore the advice of this group <e> <s> to suggest that someone else should step in to see whether the secretary of state has departed significantly from what was recommended to him undermines the whole purpose of parliament saying that the secretary of state shall be the final court of appeal <e> <s> we should not undermine that <e> <s> to say that the matter must go through both houses of parliament with negative orders and so on is using a sledgehammer against something that is hardly likely to arise <e>", "<cs> my lords it is unreasonable to think that a governing body would not consult the headmaster or teachers before reaching a decision <e> <s> to give them the power in the commonsense knowledge that they would acquaint themselves with all the circumstances before reaching a decision seems very sensible indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords if the view expressed is that the government should find some way of meeting the spirit of this amendment and if it is meant that this should be done by way of statute i am certain that is wrong <e> <s> this is not a matter that can be dealt with by statute but by educating the general public particularly people who sit on local authorities <e> <s> they should be encouraged not to show partiality because it is not in the interests of the education service <e> <s> people with merit and knowledge are required to do what is necessary but to try to find words to put in a statute would be inadequate <e> <s> it would also be setting an example <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been many attractive and appealing speeches made on this subject and ones immediate emotion would be very much on the side of what the speeches were asking for <e> <s> however if we are going to be responsible parliamentarians i do not think that we ought to ask for such words to be put into the statute without knowing the cost involved <e> <s> indeed we ought to know what it will cost to place such a duty on the government <e>", "<cs> my lords far from the words which the noble lord wishes to delete having no effect i think it is vital that they should be left in <e> <s> it is the general practice in industry that a change in ownership of an enterprise to a new employer means that the conditions and the terms are exactly as they were before <e> <s> the employees are not entitled to redundancy or other concessions that normally would be the case <e> <s> i think that that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend not surprised that at a time when the industrial development in this country is obvious so many well-informed people who have previously held office and who should have a real understanding of the matter should want to draw attention to the odd quirk which of necessity is bound to exist at some time <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that we admire the tolerant way in which he has accepted the wholesale criticism regarding the management of the house <e> <s> is it not time that the house itself looked at the mote in its own eyes <e> <s> recently the leader of the opposition

very much <e>", "<cs> i must point out that the amendment does not state a company it reads to any person <e> <s> as the wording stands it means that the person could be vetoed from taking office

him <e> <s> however the noble lord said that he ought to have a copy of the statement in view of its importance to this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that he would like to have a copy as it may affect the way in which he would deal with later amendments <e> <s> that is a request that i have never heard of before and one which i have never heard being complied with <e> <s> however it was complied with <e> <s> the noble lord held up a piece of paper with words printed on it and said i have now got it <e> <s> i did not see the noble lord leave the chamber i did not see my <e>", "<cs> i should like to say one word and then i shall not pursue the matter further <e> <s> the noble lord has confirmed everything that i have said concerning the rules of procedure regarding reading

friend aware that the potential both in terms of money and national prestige that is available from the film industry and the theatre is very great <e> <s> perhaps it deserves a slightly more positive approach from the government than his answer seems to indicate <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend answers the details of that speech there is a general matter which should be clarified or confirmed <e> <s> has the noble lord just announced a new policy of the labour party which does not appear in its recently published programme <e>", "<cs> i think that he has because he said that if potential purchasers of these shares knew that the labour party would be buying them back in some form or would be taking them over in the form of nationalisation they would not buy the shares in the first place <e> <s> however that is not as i understood the programme of the labour party as it has been announced publicly <e> <s> i do not understand it to be as suggested at this late hour in an insignificant sort of an amendment to a bill namely that the labour party will take back these privatised shares with no compensation and without the proper price being paid <e> <s> that is what he said <e> <s> if the industry is taken back into public ownership if ever the unpleasant time comes when the labour party is in a position to do that there is no threat if shareholders receive the market price <e> <s> they cannot lose so there is no deterrent <e> <s> therefore i should like to know whether i have taken the noble lords comments differently from what he intended or has he just announced that the labour party will nationalise in some form or another with no compensation being paid for the shares <e> <s> that is the clear message from his speech <e>", "<cs> in that case perhaps we can get this absolutely clear <e> <s> do i understand that people can buy shares in the privatised water industry with the full knowledge that they will not lose in regard to value even if we have the unpleasant experience of a labour government coming back <e> <s> can we therefore go on safely buying the shares and be sure that the threat made by the noble lord is quite without foundation <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the granting of automatic bail as is suggested in the question going too far <e> <s> should it not to some extent depend upon the degree of co-operation from the people involved on all sides <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was vague on another part of my noble friends question <e> <s> he seemed to indicate that the director general ought to ask for representations to be made if someone genuinely thought that there was something to make representations about <e> <s> is he in favour i hope that he is not but if he is i trust that my noble friend will not agree to it of encouraging the authorities to ask for people to make representations against a point that is put forward in all good faith in the first place <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord peyton has a point <e> <s> as it stands it looks as though the government expect that there will be differences of view between the secretary of state and the director <e> <s> it would be better to have it made clear

opposite to happen <e> <s> i do not believe that that is good <e>", "<cs> i agree with the words of my noble friend as he expressed them in moving the amendment rather more than with the words of the amendment itself <e> <s> i agree absolutely with my noble friend that the decision to refer a matter to the monopolies and mergers commission should rest with the secretary of state <e> <s> the amendment states that <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend can give a satisfactory reply to the main point raised by the noble lord <e> <s> the only reason why i made a point of being present in the committee when these issues were discussed was because i do not share the supreme confidence that the monopolies and mergers commission has the special knowledge and aptitude required <e> <s>

indicate anything which would enable anyone to find out what it is all about <e> <s> i should have thought that it ought to have been delayed until some agreement had been made with the financial institutions on what is involved as has come out in the various questions <e> <s> after paying tribute to my noble friend for the delightful way in which he always reads statements i ask him what was the point of making this one if there was nothing new to say <e>", "<cs> it is amazing how people who are at the same event have recollections which are entirely different <e> <s> the noble lord lord mellish said that no opposition was expressed from any side when this scheme was introduced to give exemption for life from the normal hazards of living and working <e> <s> in fact there was a considerable amount of opposition <e> <s> there were some of us who felt at the time that for any government to pass legislation that gave exemption in perpetuity for advantages not allocated to everyone else was a mistake and that it could not and should not last <e> <s> i do not think it right in approaching these amendments that we should look at the matter from the point of view that the bill represents a drastic move away from a scheme that was universally accepted <e>", "<cs> what an ingenious advocate the noble lord lord mellish is supported by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s>

noble friend confirm that whatever commitments may follow the so-called obligation local authorities in the areas concerned will still have powers to give their views as to what should happen in the development of the site <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put a small practical question to my noble friend regarding the slopping out system that was mentioned <e> <s> if an aircraft with its limited space and all its problems can overcome the situation as efficiently as it does why cannot that system be applied in the prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that most of his supporters would be very disappointed if he were to be satisfied with the state of the economy <e> <s> there is always room for improvement <e> <s> he has done an excellent job as a member of a

express <e>", "<cs> my noble friends points are sound when taken separately but he did not face up to the one point made by my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil <e> <s> i agree that power in these matters should be given to the secretary of state to meet the eventualities to which my noble friend referred but i find it difficult to accept that million it can go up to twice that amount should be available to a secretary of state without parliament even having a chance to give a nod or a wink in connection with it <e>", "<cs> i believe that this is a point which at some stage ought to be clarified if the government want people to make bids <e> <s> if something is altered as a result of government action and it results in additional expense being incurred i believe that a claim for compensation ought to be looked at favourably <e> <s> i believe that there is a precedent in planning <e> <s> if one has planning permission to develop a site and for some reason before the plan has

alerted the government and their colleagues in this house and i hope in another <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a good second reading speech or a good eve-of-the-polls speech <e> <s> however i think we should look at the matter in the practical way in which my noble friend has looked at it <e> <s> i felt that the noble aroness lady david was a little grudging in the way in which she reacted to the efforts made by my noble friend to keep the matter alive <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with that <e> <s> but the point i am making is that the conversations which my noble friend has had and the letter which the noble baroness received show that the department is still looking for improvements if it can get them in the general administration of the provisions of the bill when it is enacted <e> <s> the comment i make is that the noble baroness criticises the point being made at third reading but i think this is an ideal time at which to make it <e>", "<cs> my lords following the great compliment paid by the noble lord lord peston a moment ago although it was right for my noble friend to say that he has no plans for winding up the commission now i hope that he will not close his mind to the fact that it may well need to be amended and improved in many ways in the future in the light of modern circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords what evidence is there to show that the take-up of family credit has <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that if there is an anomaly in guildford everyone would wish the situation to be looked into <e> <s> however is he also aware that if he widens the london boundary for grants he will be opening a very wide door indeed and not only for students <e>", "<cs> that point ought to be made clear <e> <s> it would be wrong for one or two people for reasons which have nothing whatever to do with whether or not the grant should be made to be able to frustrate it because they may not want to pay a contribution as the system now stands <e> <s> if the improvement is deemed to be desirable and the majority of the people involved think so it ought to be made clear that that cannot be frustrated by one or two for reasons outside the need for improvement not wanting to make a contribution <e>", "<cs> i should like to add to that comment and perhaps the noble lord will answer both questions <e> <s> what are we after <e> <s> we wish to provide safeguards for the spending of money in the correct way <e> <s> once one has established that the tender has been proved by the test of tendering to be the right one why should anyone but the people who have to accept the work when it is done choose who should carry out the work <e> <s> if the estimates are within the correct financial range those people should decide who carries out the work <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord saying that it is not possible for a second firm to come along accept the terms of the bill of quantities and the specifications as laid down and carry them out as effectively as the first one <e> <s> it is possible to inherit the obligations and the standards that somebody else has tendered for <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to understand from the answers that my noble friend has given that the reason we are being prosecuted at present when others are also falling short and are not being prosecuted is because we are more efficient in our book-keeping and with our general organisation <e> <s> is that what he said <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has said that he recognises the problems that have been set out but that after great consideration it is not intended to do anything about them in this bill <e> <s> do i understand from that that there are other means which the government have in mind where the same point may be made but not as regards this bill <e>

something <e> <s> if the suggestion of the noble lord lord northfield were adopted all the strictures included in the noble lords speech would be met <e> <s> why does he not say just that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say to my noble friend that i think he ought to go an inch or two further along this road and not allow the issue to be pushed to a vote with the impression that that would give as to the beliefs of both sides of the committee about the principle behind what is proposed when it is quite clear that all are agreed on the matter especially as regards the comment made by the noble and learned lord from the cross-benches <e> <s> he should go further along that road to show that serious thought will be given to find the right words which are not there at present <e> <s> we have only received a promise of a leaflet in that respect <e> <s> if he were to do as i suggest it would be a sign that at any rate there is a possibility of the points which have been made on all sides of the committee being implemented <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord recognise that what he is asking for would be granted if the tribunal was satisfied that it would be right to grant it <e> <s> the tribunal

question <e> <s> i am rather confused <e> <s> surely a member pays his trade union contribution in order to get help from his trade union in circumstances such as that <e> <s> if the trade union does not undertake that obligation having received the prescription that means that it does not think that there is a case to fight <e> <s> is that not the real situation <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friends spirited defence of the present situation an indication that despite the strong evidence being produced by questions the government are not likely even to think of doing something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that after the mover of the amendment has spoken and had been answered the question was not open to general debate under the rules we have agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords are we not being a little too pedantic in our approach on report to this series of amendments <e> <s> i consider that the battle has been won <e> <s> to write this point into the bill is one thing and

lords why not withdraw the statement until the noble lord can confirm it <e> <s> would that not be a better way of sorting out the different views <e>", "<cs> my lords did we not agree that after the mover of the amendment had spoken the debate could not continue on report <e> <s> is that not one of our rules <e>", "<cs> my lords as always the noble baroness shows good sense and there is logic behind her argument <e> <s> however that is not what we shall be asked to vote on if the matter is pressed to a vote <e> <s> as my noble friend said the amendment brings in this almost unbelievable idea that there could be a conscientious objection <e> <s> while one sees the force of the argument of the noble baroness i do not believe that that applies in considering whether we can accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment carries the nannying state a little too <e>", "<cs> my lords i read the amendment very carefully <e> <s> it was becaue i have personal experience in some of my own businesses that i reacted to the amendment <e> <s> sometimes the machines used for massage on people with rheumatism stop <e> <s> the top has to be taken off in order to get at the slight

counter-productive to have to listen to the conclusions of various reports which are quoted such as that by the ark group merely because they fit in with the preconceived ideas of the people who quote them <e> <s> is there any evidence at all to show that people who have to make the decisions have deliberately ignored any evidence for or against the desirability of having or not having nuclear power <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask my noble friend a question as i find this particular manoeuvre rather interesting <e> <s> is it suggested that the officers of the council are a party to this sort of arrangement which is a way of getting around the general principle behind the regulation in a rather underhand way <e>", "<cs> my lords since noble lords are responsible for the accuracy of any question that they put down has my noble friend evidence to demonstrate the fact that even now the official opposition would support a ban irrespective of the effect that it would have upon our defence capabilities during this period of change <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one point which i believe should be kept in mind <e> <s> noble lords in their strictures talk about the government having done this and having done that <e> <s> these alterations are the result of what parliament the other place thinks about it <e> <s> on a question such as this the house of commons has a greater authority or should have for putting its point of view as to <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the self-congratulation for the supposed great success are we being fair to the other place <e> <s> we are partners in working parliament and its members who went into greater detail than we did <e>", "<cs> they decided upon something quite different <e> <s> ought we not to keep in mind the fact that the only reason the cameras are present in this house with their powers to sweep round and so forth is that we were being used as a trojan horse in order to get the cameras where they really wanted them <e>", "<cs> the other place is well aware of the dangers which we do not have but which it should take into account <e> <s> are we being fair in our supposed laudatory evidence about the correctness of having the cameras present <e>", "<cs> my lords since this is a very personal matter for coach passengers can the minister say whether we have to do everything via an ec directive <e> <s> as the noble baroness asked cannot we deal with this matter in our own way and to our own requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that the committee had suggested that british management should to some extent copy the japanese <e> <s> did the committee look into the position relative to trade unions <e> <s> in the shipbuilding industry for example how far do the unions decide who will do what jobs as compared with this country <e> <s> did the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord gave us a very clear indication of the recommendations of the committee after its deep research <e> <s> i am asking him about the recommendations as regards the trade union element <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord lord hatch given a previous example of a bill that has been produced at the same time as the queens speech announcements <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that both the question and his answer contain a misnomer <e> <s> there is not a european parliament there is a european assembly <e> <s> to attribute to that assembly parliamentary powers as we understand them in this country can be dangerous <e> <s> is not the council of ministers the proper force to ensure that the commission is scrutinised and kept in order <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the picture that can be painted from the questions that my noble friend has answered should it not be made clear that alongside the situation in america germany france and our main competitor countries our directors salaries are very low indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may suggest to the noble lord that the tory opposition did its duty in pointing out that the bill was hybrid so that it was possible to remain within the rules of order and terms of reference <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the general desire to give assistance to poland in particular is very widespread in this country <e> <s> has he any details as to what machinery has been set up to bring this about

noble friend told my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that he was quite right was he saying that each individual workman working for a private contractor will have to give a written undertaking just as civil servants do <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that one of the contributions that the government could make is to be more forceful in regard to other nations which are critical of what this government are doing and to persuade them to make a contribution themselves to alleviate some of the problems that have arisen <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend say whether the current war widows pension is tax free or whether tax-free status is confined to the grant that has been announced today <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend and the government take into account what is said in this house and the other place when they are considering future actions in response to the statement <e> <s> i hope they will not feel that some of the implications behind the questions and comments are accepted universally <e> <s> i doubt that the implications behind some of the questions will be accepted by a majority of people outside parliament and in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords before probing the matter in this house should we not wait for the report of the official committee which was set up in another place which has the power to get to all of the facts <e> <s> we would then be probing on the facts and not on guesswork <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend gives good figures in terms of the amount invested <e> <s> however is he satisfied that the facilities and the expertise are available to exploit it to the full <e> <s> i ask that because there has been some suggestion that the availability of the necessary expertise has been disbanded and spread out and therefore will not be available to enable full use to be made of the investment about which he has told us <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> he seems to have said with some confidence that the committee approved this line <e> <s> does he think that if at that time the committee had had in front of it the statements that both the governor of the bank of england and the president of the bundesbank were recommending against that action at this time because of the great risk it would have been as adamant as he suggests to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i coupled his name with that of the bank of england <e>", "<cs> my lords i never know whether it is an advantage or disadvantage for ones name to be at the end of a list of speakers <e> <s> the disadvantage is that everyone has made the points that one would have liked to have made in ones own way and with ones own emphasis <e> <s> as one would expect this has happened in this case <e> <s> i have signposted the points that i should like to have made but they have already been made effectively <e> <s> it would be wrong and presumptuous to repeat them <e> <s> however there may be some ad vantage in considering the issues that have been raised in the debate to try to interpret some of the parliamentary language that is not always understood outside the house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may finish this point <e> <s> i shall then be delighted to give way <e> <s> the noble lord having made the point added the two or three conditions that he said he would wish to follow <e> <s> these are identical to those which the prime minister has said she wants before taking the next step <e> <s> i did not recognise a great deal of difference <e>", "<cs> my lords no i was listening intently <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one condition with which the prime minister may not agree <e> <s> as regards the others he required the exchanges to be right he said that the inflation position must be right <e> <s> those are precisely the points that the prime minister is making <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not realise that the debate would continue for or years and that the time between being on and off the escalator was too long <e> <s> but i have not done badly i am not complaining on that score <e> <s> all i am saying is that the speed must be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly the point that i was making <e> <s> i was saying as the noble lord lord greenhill said with much more authority that the events in eastern europe are bound to have affected the situation <e> <s> therefore one can mean only that one ought not to sign the contract in the analogy that i gave until one has considered the difference that the events will make <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble lord was not on to that point before he began <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very proper <e> <s> perhaps i may answer that point first <e> <s> i absolutely agree <e> <s> that is what i wanted to do <e> <s> the first person i approached to make the point was the chairman of the sub-committee himself the noble lord lord allen <e> <s> he said that there was nothing he could do <e> <s> i then approached other leaders of the house who have the necessary contacts <e> <s> i was told that if i wanted to put the matter on the record there was no way of breaking in <e> <s> the debate that we are having now is an opportunity for the issue to be put on the record <e> <s> i am now doing so in the light of advice i have received <e> <s> it may have been wrong advice <e> <s> for those who are listening i hope that they will take the advice and not repeat in future what happened last week <e>", "<cs> my lords i have <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall not withdraw the allegation <e> <s> the noble lord has a job to do and he is following it as a member of the front bench as indeed has my noble friend <e> <s> this matter is addressed to the people who organise the business of the house <e> <s> i have given the dates and they will now be on the record <e> <s> if the noble lord will look at those dates and see how they follow on he can come to his own conclusions as to whether or not the impartiality and objectivity which it is vital that our committees should have were helped or hindered by the way in which this particular matter was dealt with last week <e> <s> he can come to his own conclusions <e> <s> i have come to mine <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that this house is not in a position to comment on taxation <e> <s> is that not the sole responsibility of another place <e>", "<cs> as a matter of general interest which may not fit specifically with these amendments i am interested that we are speedily giving effect to convention decisions made only a year ago <e> <s> are other countries doing so <e> <s> the concluding words of the noble earl in explaining what these amendments meant were that the changes enabled us to co-operate with other countries to achieve what the convention had in mind <e> <s> do other countries need to enshrine that in their legislation as we are doing today <e> <s> have they done it <e>", "<cs> i do not doubt for a minute that the last observations made by the noble lord are right <e> <s> whatever system eventually comes into being by virtue of this bill there will be good and bad and almost good and almost bad whichever consideration you apply <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that i had made that point clear but it is obvious that i had not made it clear to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> the point i was trying to make had nothing to do with licensing law <e> <s> i was trying to make the point that the lawyer in the same profession as the noble lord who has sat for many years in the courts mainly on the prosecuting side may not have appreciated the defence point of view <e> <s> i agree with what the noble lord said <e> <s> it is nothing to do with licensing <e> <s> the psychological point made by my noble friend should be taken rather more into account than the rigid legal points that the professional lawyers have made in the many speeches that i have heard <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend judge from the tone of the questions from the other side of the house that they are an encouragement for laggards not to pay or an encouragement to laggards to think again and pay their proper dues <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what effect the fact that there is a picture being taken of everyone will have on the merit or demerit of any statement <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a laymans reaction to what could flow from this <e> <s> by and large the ordinary citizen who must tolerate the results of these decisions feels that there are occasions when a matter should be brought to an end <e> <s> there is a feeling that it has been examined in detail impartially and objectively and that a judgment has been given but that if a way can be found of extending the matter further then it goes on and on <e> <s> one sees many examples of that within the american system where sometimes cases continue for years <e> <s> i do not believe that that is in the best interests of people accepting what is sound judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not have been generous on the part of the noble earl to withdraw this question in view of the time that will be spent on the same subject matter as a result of his amendment later today <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord taylor has as usual been succinct <e> <s> we have his point <e> <s> he has been correct as many who have contributed to the second reading debate have not <e> <s> i do not believe that i have listened to a second reading debate in which more committee stage speeches have been made <e> <s> a good example was the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> he stitched together six or seven committee points and presented them most adeptly as a second reading speech <e> <s> i believe that i know why he did that <e> <s> he did it because had he followed the rule of discussing the principle behind the bill he would have found it difficult to oppose the second reading especially in the light of his speech on his bill a few weeks ago when he made it clear that he believed that we had reached a stage with regard to government and finance where everyone recipients employers and the government should contribute <e> <s> that is what the bill achieves <e>", "<cs> my lords what a delightful cover-up that is <e> <s> is the poor innocent in any doubt as to what the amendment is <e> <s> there is no doubt that the amendment is a type of wrecking amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord rose to the charge without being serious about it <e> <s> if the amendment were carried there is no doubt that it would have the same effect as voting against second reading <e> <s> although technically the noble lord would not be voting against second reading it would be the equivalent <e> <s> i hope that my noble friends will take that point into account because should we lose the vote on this measure the effect will be to damage the governments general standing at a time when it is important that it should be maintained <e> <s> i do not expect that to make any impression on noble lords opposite but i hope that what i say may make some impression on my noble friends on this side of the house <e> <s> let us make no bones about it that would be the effect of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i refuse to be pushed off this point <e> <s> like the noble lord i have gone through the parliamentary procedures for years and i can recognise a manoeuvre when i see one <e> <s> i am able to recognise the effects that can flow from such a measure <e> <s> the noble lord knows perfectly well that while this is not a second reading vote the effect that would flow if the amendment were successful would be equivalent to that <e> <s> i maintain that that would be very damaging <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not suggested for one moment that anything is out of order <e> <s> we would not have reached the stage that we have if that were the case <e> <s> however what i am interpreting for my noble friends is the fact that although the amendment is in order in technical terms its effect would be equivalent to a vote on second reading from this house <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord examines what i have said he will perhaps recognise that effect because he is an experienced politician <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is or at least was the leader of a group in this house <e> <s> which issue does she think would hit the headlines tomorrow <e> <s> will it be the second vote on second reading which is just a straightforward procedural matter or will it be the defeat on the amendment <e> <s> which issue does the noble baroness think would hit the headlines <e> <s> which would have the greater effect on the country <e> <s> i have no doubt in my own mind on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has sat in this house for many years and seen the changes that i have seen <e> <s> in this house it used to be the case that when a point was made it was rarely repeated it was on the record <e> <s> debates were over in two or three hours whereas now as the noble lord lord taylor has said because of repetition the debate has lasted seven or eight hours <e> <s> that tendency <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that even if the assumed rate of inflation was replaced by the actual rate of inflation many local authorities are still well above what their expenditure should be based on past experience <e> <s> is he further aware that many people in this country are disturbed at the consequences of that and expect such authorities to be capped without undue delay <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that the statement seems too relaxed bearing in mind the nature of the report in front of us <e> <s> fortunately that can be rectified <e> <s> this is a first reaction and i have no doubt that after comments have been made in both houses actions can be taken and extra thought given to the matter <e>", "<cs> i do not know what experience the noble earl has of another place because the whole of his speech argued the case for powers for another place to use <e> <s> those who have experience of another place over the years can tell the noble earl that providing parliament is alert the difference between an affirmative and a negative resolution is infinitesimal <e> <s> there is no difference at all between them <e> <s> it depends upon the alertness of parliament itself as to whether or not the negative power would be used <e> <s> in order to avoid silly waste of parliamentary time the negative procedure has many advantages <e> <s> if the issue at stake is flippant and not of major importance another place would not use its powers to obtain time to use the negative resolution procedure which is the alternative <e> <s> however if the significance of what would be done is of the importance that the noble earl has in mind those in another place will see to it that their parliamentary time is allocated for the negative procedure <e> <s> the fear that an affirmative resolution has a greater power of being discussed than the negative procedure depends per cent <e> <s> upon the decision and the alertness of parliament itself <e>", "<cs> nobody is more aware of the real meaning of parliamentary words than the noble lord who has just moved this amendment <e> <s> he is a past master <e> <s> i believe that he and mr crosland were perhaps the two most effective back-benchers in the other place for many years <e> <s> the noble lord spent time being poetical about cardinal newman and then he took up part of his minutes by giving my noble friend lady young a basin of broth he ended by hitting her on the head with a spoon <e> <s> however the effect of this amendment would be to negate the decision which we made on second reading <e> <s> it is a negation of the principle to which we agreed on second reading which was the right time to do that

have to take for granted i hope that it is true in most cases although we all know that it is not true in every case that people satisfy themselves as to what the issue is before voting <e> <s> i do not believe that the second reading of this bill was any different to other second readings over many years and under different governments <e>", "<cs> at second reading we voted on the principle of when the scheme would start <e> <s> this amendment would make it impossible for it to start at the time set out when we gave the bill a second reading <e> <s> that is a negation of the decision made at second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend as concerned as i am to notice on occasions such as this the eagerness with which noble lords opposite seem to enjoy denigrating any contributions we make to the outcome of any of these conferences <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to put forward what i presume to suggest is a parliamentarians point of view <e> <s> i have listened to debates on the bill during most of its stages <e> <s> at the beginning the lawyers approached their task rather truculantly and the general atmosphere that they created mitigated against their success in obtaining certain changes <e> <s> however when earlier they put forward this proposal they received a reaction from the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor which indicated that he was sympathetic to their general point <e>", "<cs> i wonder what kind of answers we expect from the government front bench on some of these amendments <e> <s> this matter has been drawn to my attention by the attitude which the committee has adopted <e> <s> perhaps i should modify that by referring to the attitude adopted by the noble earl lord russell on the last amendment <e> <s> very pertinent points were made concerning it and my noble friend answered them very clearly <e> <s> he said that he had given answers clearly as he saw the issue but that there were still matters of doubt and issues that needed to be looked at <e> <s> he said that he would look at them and come back at a later stage <e>", "<cs> is my noble friend under an obligation to give the committee the information that it needs <e> <s> when considering intricate matters such as those concerned with this bill if we are not careful we shall be destroying our procedures <e> <s> that would not be in the best interests of good government <e>", "<cs> i wish to make a point on the fantasy described by the noble lord <e> <s> if those circumstances arose and it was in the interest of the country that such action should be taken is not the flexibility that he says is being left to the advantage of the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords while in no way deviating from the principle behind the community charge which is sound and fair does my noble friend agree that this is an anomaly which will be examined when a revision takes place next year in order to straighten out some of the quirks which will arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord used a particular phrase because i am certain that noble lords will completely disregard any case which is based upon the premise that a government have been deliberately vindictive <e> <s> that approach to a problem such as this puts the whole matter out of court regarding our attention <e> <s> the motion is a good and fair one <e> <s> it is the kind of motion that we should have in mind at the beginning of the imposition of the community charge with the idea of returning to it as the measure progresses <e> <s> the speech of the noble baroness in support of the motion was per cent acceptable to all sides <e> <s> however she could not help herself in speaking with a certain prejudice as regards per cent of her speech <e>", "<cs> i have not heard one single argument without the duke of westminster being brought into it <e> <s> what does the duke pay towards the cost of local government expenditure from which everybody benefits <e> <s> we all have our little machines so we can work it out <e> <s> we have access to the blue book which will tell us whether or not the formula that we work to is the correct one <e> <s> i should like to put on record one or two figures which could answer the noble lord lord hughes if he is prepared to listen <e> <s> however i do not believe that the noble lord lord stallard will accept them

were worked out by machines and confirmed by my own accountant <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at the figures i think that he will change his mind <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while the condition of prisons and their general management are of outstanding importance and perhaps the most vital issues this statement concerns a prison riot <e> <s> with that in mind will he pay special attention to the comment made by the noble lord who drew attention to the risk of copycat actions arising in other prisons <e> <s> when he is setting the terms of reference for any inquiry will he consider the possibility of examining whether the television cameras reflecting all that they see is a good thing <e> <s> it was quite clear that in this instance the people on the roofs were taking certain actions and searching for publicity <e> <s> the risk of copycat action could arise from that <e> <s> will that matter be included in the terms of reference <e> <s> the presence of

might discover how many hospitals could be built out of the interest being saved from not having to fund the national debt <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness is right in saying that it is the governments job once a general point has been made to find a specific answer that will fit in with the bill <e> <s> if the noble baroness and her friends are satisfied that this unfairness exists and if they cannot find words which will straighten out what they consider to be unfairness why should it automatically be the job of the government <e> <s> it may well be that this point in the view of the government is well covered in the bill already <e> <s> it may well be that what is already there could be properly and sensibly applied <e> <s> i do not accept the noble baronesss point that because an attractive proposition is made in general terms a government who introduce a bill have an obligation to provide the wording when noble lords opposite had every opportunity to do so both in committee and on report <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the last question which came from the front bench opposite does my noble friend understand that the official policy of the opposition now is to reduce vat from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> ought he not to ask them to explain how they will make up the leeway to finance all the other measures that have

world is so obviously in a state of flux is it not a nonsense even to suggest that we make a full disclosure of our defence intentions and our general position <e>", "<cs> my lords i must interrupt the noble lord to say that as he has reminded the house the last debate was in government time and so government supporters were justifying their policies <e> <s> now the debate is in opposition time

amendment <e> <s> however as the amendment is so fundamental we should come back to it if we possibly can <e> <s> as i understand the position the point that the noble lord lord mishcon made is extremely important and fundamental <e> <s> he has said that it has always been the case and should remain the case that the final word on nationality should come from the secretary of state who represents parliament and the nation <e> <s> that has always been the case and that is how i personally would like it to remain <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord says a final word about his decision perhaps i may point out to my noble friend that he said that he had already given the matter much consideration that the circumstances had not changed and that therefore it would be waste of time to give the noble lord an indication that there might be an alteration <e> <s> perhaps <e>", "<cs> it would be possible to hold the point of view expressed by the noble lord lord wyatt but to be opposed

state is not the right way <e> <s> none of us is oblivious of the strong feelings that were expressed and de bated prior to the publishing of the bill now before us <e> <s> if circumstances should

circumstances and the strength of feeling as regards whether we could afford to have them and whether it would be right to do so <e> <s> even if the circumstances envisaged by the noble lord lord wyatt <e> <s> arose the amendment should not be accepted enabling the secretary of state to raise the figure by order <e> <s> the issue would be greater than that and we should not pass this amendment however we view the possibility <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord think that it should be done by order even if those things happen <e> <s> is not the proper way to proceed through parliament because of the fundamentals behind the change <e>", "<cs> i do not think the noble lord is fair in putting his argument in the form of closed mind <e> <s> in terms of stability there is the stability of this country too to be borne in mind <e> <s> of course we want stability in hong kong and we hope we have arrived at the point where we have been able to achieve that <e> <s> but it has taken a long time
