["<cs> my lords in answer to a question yesterday my noble friend lord belstead set out the guidelines which will govern any future use of baton rounds in great britain <e> <s> in northern ireland baton rounds have been available to the security forces since <e> <s> in circumstances where there is risk of loss of life or of widespread destruction of property the chief constable and the general officer commanding consider that baton rounds are the most effective means of controlling riots consistent with the principle of minimum force <e> <s> the government agree with that view <e> <s> i hope the decline in rioting following the end of the hunger strike will continue thereby reducing the need for such forms of control <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be for the convenience of the house if with the leave of the house i now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for northern ireland <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord blease gets up i should like to apologise to the house for not being in my place as i should have been <e> <s> i was advised that this order would come on substantially later <e> <s> but it was my responsibility and i am most sorry <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate my noble friend on the <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have noted the resolutions passed by the european parliament about the use of plastic baton rounds <e> <s> the security forces are subject to strict provisions of the law <e> <s> they are required to use no more force than is reasonable in the circumstances and the application of that principle to methods of riot control is under continuous review <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the departments no <e> <s> northern ireland order the draft of which was laid before your lordships house on th may be approved <e> <s> on nd march we debated the departments northern ireland order <e> <s> this as your lordships will remember established a new department of finance and personnel in northern ireland <e> <s> that first phase of the reorganisation of departments following detailed reports on their organisation in the spring of last year was completed by st april this year and strengthened the control functions of the civil service <e>", "<cs> i wish at the outset to thank noble lords opposite and particularly the noble lord lord wedderburn for their kind act in welcoming me back from the deep peace of the northern ireland double bed to the hurly-burly of the industrial relations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill he now read a second time <e> <s> the bill seeks to give effect to such proposals in the governments recent white paper as require legislation <e> <s> the governments policy is summed up in the title of the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to stand corrected by my noble friend lord brookeborough and to qualify what i said admittedly and in fairness to myself in a slightly different context and at an earlier stage by saying that of course no change would be made without the consent of a majority of the people of northern ireland and as i said at the same stage also to the noble lord lord monson even if there were to be the consent of a majority of the people of northern ireland to a constitutional change that constitutional change would have to pass through both houses of the british parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords a similar amendment was moved in committee and the noble lord lord mccarthy acknowledged that <e> <s> noble lords opposite made the point then as the noble lord has now that all unfair dismissals are to be equally condemned and that if limits for awards of compensation are to be raised at all they should be raised for all cases <e> <s> i agree that all unfair dismissals are to be regretted and there is no difference between me and lord mccarthy on that <e> <s> as i pointed out in committee we believe that certain kinds of unfair dismissal merit the substantially enhanced levels of compensation which the bill provides and the reasons are simple <e> <s> first we are dealing not with dismissals which have been carried out because of some altercation between employer and employee or vice versa but with dismissals which have been carried out in open defiance of rights specifically and recently passed by parliament and that is something we wish to deter very emphatically <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> did the party which he supports break the mould of politics when they doubled unemployment <e> <s> is not this some indication that levels of unemployment are beyond the control of individual governments whatever their policy <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> can he elucidate a little bit further on this issue of the nations purchasing power which is bothering me <e> <s> there is no evidence whatever that there is any great depression of the purchasing power of the nation <e> <s> purchasing is rather buoyant at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if i now repeat a statement on unemployment statistics which has been made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment <e> <s> my right honourable friends statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be for the convenience of the house if at this point i repeated a statement which has been made in another place by my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for northern ireland about the bombing at ballykelly co londonderry <e> <s> my honourable friends statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords in november my right honourable friend announced in another place his decision to abolish of the industry training boards <e> <s> at the same time he said he would review the position of the hotel and catering industry training board early in <e> <s> we have therefore recently asked the manpower services commission to carry out a review of training arrangements in all sectors currently in scope to the board <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft financial provisions northern ireland order be approved <e> <s> this is the latest in a series of such orders which have been presented at intervals of approximately two years to deal with miscellaneous matters of a financial nature <e> <s> the last order in the series was the financial provisions northern ireland order <e> <s> the main purpose of these orders is to increase as necessary limits imposed by northern <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft appropriation northern ireland order which was laid before this house on th february be approved <e> <s> this order is being made under paragraph of schedule to the northern ireland act <e> <s> its purpose is to appropriate the spring supplementary estimates and the vote on account of northern ireland departments <e>", "<cs> my lords the youth training scheme will guarantee the early offer of a high quality training place to all unemployed -year-old school-leavers <e> <s> some employed -year-old school-leavers will also be covered <e> <s> sixteen-year-old school-leavers entering employment who are not covered by the scheme may receive training but that will depend on the employer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than conventionally grateful to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for causing us to debate this afternoon this topic of the relationship between her majestys government and the nationalised industries <e> <s> give or take a month or two there must be a general election within a year <e> <s> our constitution is of course a free one and it allows the political parties the chance to compete in offering clear choices to the public <e> <s> nowhere is the choice clearer surely than over this issue of the right approach to the nationalised industries by government <e> <s> in my view the social democrats whom the noble lord supports are ambivalent in their approach <e> <s> on the one hand they recognise that all is not well with the industries and here they are quite close to the government <e> <s> on the other hand they make great play as the noble lord did of the need for continuity and stability and they shrink from making changes <e> <s> their motto seems to be dont shoot the pianist he is doing his best <e> <s> that is not an unreasonable policy and i shall try to deal with it in a little more depth in a few moments but it is not one which is liable to give us much in the way of a concert <e>"]
