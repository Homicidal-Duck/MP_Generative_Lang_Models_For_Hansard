["<cs> my lords i hope that the house will forgive such an early intrusion into its counsels but mindful of the need to be non-controversial and with my experience in another place in business management and the usual channels the temptation presented by a debate on this report was irresistible <e> <s> i was delighted when the noble lords lord denham and lord ponsonby agreed to act as sponsors for my introduction into this place because i had what my noble friend lord dean of beswick assures me is a noble prial of chief whips <e> <s> if anybody does not play brag then i apologise to their lordships <e>", "<cs> i do not feel that it should be only scots who speak in this debate because i believe that the question of devolution for scotland is a matter which affects the whole of the united kingdom and the implications should be carefully thought about <e>", "<cs> my lords anyone who has been a public representative at council or parliamentary level or in some other capacity will know that the problems of housing and homelessness are the most intractable and the most frequent that have to be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords i much enjoyed the speech of the right reverend prelate the bishop of chester and also that of the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead <e> <s> i shall refer to the remarks of the right reverend prelate later in my speech <e> <s> as regards the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead the only slightly discordant note that struck me was when he referred to obscure cricketing records <e> <s> i must say as the holder of one such obscure cricketing record i should not like them to be disparaged <e> <s> the first over that i bowled for the lords and commons cricket team was hit for runs <e> <s> i was assured by sir eric bullus as i came off the field that it would go into the club records as the worst performance up until that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that my noble friend lord ponsonby is on the front bench <e> <s> had he not been i should have felt obliged to draw to his attention the remarks of the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls because so detailed was the advice on how the opposition should conduct itself that i felt he might well on reflection consider co-opting him as an unofficial member of his whips office <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that forthcoming reply and ask him to accept from me that there is widespread concern about this matter <e> <s> there have been allegations that our regulations are among the slackest in western europe <e> <s> therefore i hope that the noble earl will pursue this matter with the utmost urgency <e> <s> perhaps i may have his assurance that it will be so dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord said that there is such a substantial body of evidence to be studied before a decision can be reached will he undertake that his decision will not be announced during the long summer recess but will await the return of this house in the autumn <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the response there has been to my modest little effort which i may say has been much warmer than the response i had from bristol university in the early s when i first began to promulgate this idea <e> <s> in addition to being a fount of radical proposals as the noble lord lord trafford said i am also fairly obsessional when i get a bee in my bonnet <e> <s> that is why i thought that the hats might be a peg on which to hang it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to present a petition from tenants of withywood <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl and the committee for all the work that has been done and also for the most comprehensive way in which he introduced the report <e> <s> despite the decision of the house over a year ago that maiden speeches should not be trailed which seems to be honoured more in the breach than in the observance i should also like to say that i am looking forward to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord bridges <e>", "<cs> my lords one advantage of speaking in a hybrid debate of this nature is that if one chooses the less well-used topic of the day there is less chance that ones paltry points will have been pirated although one is well down the batting order <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend lord stoddart <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl care to reflect on the remarks of his colleague in another place the minister for roads and traffic who recently said that a small number of people sitting down on westminster bridge could bring traffic in the whole of central london to a standstill <e> <s> does not this negate his remarks about st thomass hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend for introducing this debate and i should also like to reinforce the remark she made about how easy it is for young people particularly when they move away from home to sink swiftly into a morass of debt through the enticements which are offered <e> <s> but we live in a borrowing society <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the minister has said about the transport and general workers union does he mean that when in future the government are contemplating changes of any kind only those whose views are not known will be consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow what the noble lord has just said and support what has been said from both the front benches because in this particular case not only the post but the recipient merits the money <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has shown great courage in tackling a matter upon which most of us who would hesitate to go into a detailed legal debate nevertheless support in principle what he is trying to do <e> <s> we also feel that in our support we are buttressed by very many people in this country who are deeply uneasy about the existing situation but do not have the specialist knowledge to underpin their views <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ross of newport for this further opportunity to discuss this important subject <e> <s> his homelessness bill of was very much a trail blazer <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister made reference to jobs for life i began rapidly to identify with him because i believe that this chamber above all others is well versed in that field <e> <s> when he mentioned bobbing off home when there was no work to be done the sense of identity became even closer <e> <s> i was somewhat at a loss to find our equivalent of ghosting until the noble lord lord crickhowell mentioned people sitting about watching other people doing the work <e> <s> then i thought that perhaps we had a hat trick after all or what might be called a full house <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend says that it was an all-time record <e> <s> i would have to look closely at my own period in government before i acceded to that completely although i think he may well be right <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be extremely brief because my noble friend lord stallard has admirably outlined the purpose of the bill in moving the second reading <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord lord lucas was a little unfair on the other place because the private members bill procedure there is very sophisticated <e> <s> the fact that a bill receives a second reading on the nod means that there is not one out of the members of parliament who wishes to raise an objection <e> <s> a bill can only receive a second reading on the nod if there is no objection at all <e> <s> one member shouting object <e> <s> is sufficient to block its further progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> in order to get the matter into perspective would he suggest to the university authorities that it would be helpful if at the end of the long vacation they produce a return which shows how many units of accommodation were used for other purposes over what duration and what proportion that represents of the total <e>", "<cs> my lords given the remarkable events in eastern europe i think it perfectly natural that many of the speeches this evening concentrated on that aspect <e> <s> the noble viscount lord hanworth observed that there is very little to say that is new <e> <s> that is probably correct if one takes that limited european scene <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister able to say what proportion of beds in the hospital which will replace westminster hospital will be devoted to the treatment of aids <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister use some of those resources to endorse the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord hatch must have thought out the implications on employment should thorp close <e> <s> will the minister write to the noble lord asking him for his alternative proposals for the employment of those people who would be displaced if thorp were to close <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will welcome the concern that the right reverend prelate has shown in this matter <e> <s> will the government approach the church of england estates commissioners to make sure that the substantial property interests of the church of england are being fully utilised to help solve this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i have found this to be quite a fasicinating debate because throughout it and throughout all the lobbying which has taken place we have seen the academic establishment closing ranks <e> <s> indeed even today we have had a veritable milky way galaxy of academic expertise put at our disposal <e> <s> in such a firmament an extremely highly powered telescope would be needed to find me <e> <s> i say that because i went to bristol university on an ex-servicemans grant and received a second-class degree <e> <s> it will not surprise your lordships to know that it was a lower second-class degree and while some people may regard that as an attendance certificate i like to think that it combines the optimum conditions of both brains and brawn <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> does she agree that there is a difference between a fair profit and exploitation <e> <s> the brewing industry has always justified the high price of those beers which by definition carry no excise duty by saying that they are expensive to produce <e> <s> will the minister consult the january edition of <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in two months there is to be a major stamp exhibition in london to celebrate the th anniversary of the issue of the first postage stamp in the world the penny black <e> <s> is he also aware that the gratuitous knocking of the british postage service at this time does no good to this country or its benefits from tourist earnings <e>", "<cs> my lords others more experienced and expert than myself have dealt and will deal with detailed matters of social security benefits and kindred issues <e> <s> i should like to speak for a few minutes about the gap between the rich and the poor because we often take for granted manifestations of the class differences in this country which are apparent to visitors <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord who moved the amendment for not hearing his initial argument <e> <s> i must tell your lordships that however persuasive he may have been i should not have changed my mind if i had heard his remarks <e> <s> the amendment enshrines in a piece of legislation that students should go away from home in order to study <e> <s> i have recently referred in your lordships house to a conspiracy about higher education to conceal the facts from the public <e> <s> the plain truth is that there is no piece of research that shows an educational advantage in studying away from home <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister will have noted that intervention <e> <s> my remarks are addressed to the reference to the mmc of this bid for a per cent <e> <s> holding in the <e>", "<cs> my lords in my short time in this house i have become very conscious of the conventions and i respect them <e> <s> normally when i take part in a debate i try to be assiduous in observing the convention that if one speaks one should also hear the other participants <e> <s> therefore i apologise to your lordships for the fact that later this afternoon i must leave to attend a state function and i shall not be able to listen to the latest speakers nor the winding-up speeches from the front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to reinforce the point made by the noble lord lord jakobovits and also by my noble friend lord mason that if the house were to accept the amendment tonight that action will not be understood abroad <e> <s> people will not understand the niceties of our procedure <e> <s> the action will be interpreted by well-meaning honourable people in entirely the wrong way and it will be used by people who are malicious as a weapon to foster and nurture anti-semitism <e> <s> therefore we have to look beyond the barren legal arguments and consider the impression that will be created by any such decision tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not give way because there are so many other noble lords who wish to speak <e> <s> i am very sorry <e> <s> it was never suggested during that trial <e>", "<cs> my lords it was never suggested that the evidence was not good <e> <s> i was in this house when a number of your lordships congratulated the noble lord on his success <e> <s> nobody mentioned being surprised that the verdict went that way because of the time that had elapsed and the difficulty of obtaining evidence <e> <s> not a bit of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i close my remarks on that aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords they are admirable citizens but i would not regard them as a representative cross-section of the population of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords tom ponsonby was one of my sponsors when i was introduced into your lordships house <e> <s> my other sponsor was the noble lord lord denham <e> <s> i was proud and privileged to be introduced by two chief whips <e> <s> i asked them both to introduce me because that epitomised to me the importance of the usual channels in the running of the parliamentary system <e> <s> i got to know tom well through the usual channels long before i came here through my work in another place <e> <s> i was not only struck by his great good humour but also by his tolerance <e> <s> long before i came to your lordships house he taught me the importance of the usual channels in the system particularly in relation to your lordships house and the essential part they play in the running of our constitution <e> <s> i wish to extend my tribute to him and to his work <e> <s> i also wish to extend my sympathy to his family <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first apologise to the noble earl lord caithness and my noble friend lord cledwyn for not hearing their opening speeches <e> <s> it was due to a long-standing appointment at the home office <e> <s> i was fortunate enough to hear the two maiden speeches and i add my congratulations and felicitations to both speakers <e>"]
