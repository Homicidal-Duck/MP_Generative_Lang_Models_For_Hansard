["<cs> my lords i am deeply conscious of the privilege of addressing your lordships house for the first time and also of the difficulty of making a non-controversial contribution to a debate on an inevitably controversial subject a prospect which some of my friends have regarded with a combination of incredulity and merriment <e> <s> i deliberately do not want to attempt to speak on the subject of discrimination on grounds of sex <e> <s> i do not think that a representative of the church of england would find that very easy just at the moment <e> <s> i agree that the church has its difficulties <e> <s> i would not want to hide behind the exemptions granted in the act to the churches i can only assure the noble baroness lady seear who introduced this debate and who was generous enough not to mention this particular subject that we are persevering some of us <e> <s> i should also like to reassure the noble baroness lady birk that bishops wives suffer from the same disability as do the husbands of noble baronesses <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the indulgence of your lordships as i rise to support the right reverend prelate the bishop of worcester in calling attention to this case for greater european co-operation in these matters humanitarian cultural and spiritual <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord beloff for those cautions grounded in historical scholarship <e>", "<cs> my lords as a newcomer to your lordships house i did not have the pleasure of meeting tom ponsonby <e> <s> yet in addition to what we have heard i have been taken aback by the clear sense of shock and deprivation which other noble lords have mentioned making it quite clear that he was a person who was held in the highest regard <e> <s> i know that he was a man who never allowed differences of political view to cloud personal friendships <e> <s> he was highly respected both outside as well as within his own party <e> <s> i am told too that he held your lordships house in great affection <e> <s> i know that he will be greatly missed for his sagacity and his good humour <e> <s> it is an honour for me as a newcomer to pay him tribute and likewise to extend my sympathy to his family <e>"]
