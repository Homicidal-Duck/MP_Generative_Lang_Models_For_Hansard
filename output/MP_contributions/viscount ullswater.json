["<cs> my lords i should very much like to add my congratulations to those of others before me on the maiden speech of my noble friend lord fairfax <e> <s> he has shown us a glimpse of his agile brain and with his barristers mind he will be able to enlighten your lordships on divers subjects in the future <e> <s> i am sure we would welcome that <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord greenwood of rossendale for putting down the motion before us tonight <e> <s> the noble lord has put the case for acceptance of this report most succinctly and has picked out really all the salient points the committee discussed from the report <e> <s> i had the honour to be a member of that committee and i think it came to the only conclusion that was possible <e> <s> i would just go over one or two of the opinions they gave <e>", "<cs> i intervene for only a short while to support the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton in these two amendments especially where they concern section which deals with those under the age of <e> <s> in this case it is inappropriate and very unkind on a young offender albeit taking into account the seriousness of his crime <e> <s> if a long period is specified this is at a time when his character is changing a great deal <e> <s> he is maturing and growing <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady faithfull said at the beginning that she was speaking to the three amendments together <e> <s> clause deals with imprisonment for default <e> <s> it also says that no court can commit a person unless there is no other method of dealing with him which is appropriate <e> <s> in default of a fine somebody can receive a prison sentence but there is no way of providing that another form of alternative sentence is available <e> <s> for instance community service orders are not available to the originating court because it would not be an imprisonable offence if only a fine could be imposed <e> <s> i would like to clear up whether instead of being sent to prison for default of a fine a community service order could be instituted <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the noble lord lord gallacher for asking this unstarred question this evening as it gives the government the opportunity to make comments on this rather important if slightly esoteric subject <e>", "<cs> my lords to have witnessed the tragic fire at bradford city football ground in may must have engraved on the minds of those present an indelible image <e> <s> the rest of us saw the horrifying pictures of the fire on our television screens and read in our newspapers the heartrending reports of the families destroyed and injured <e> <s> we have been made aware if we were not already aware of the considerable hazards presented by packed stands of spectators and of how a sweeping fire can engulf such a stand within minutes <e> <s> for those reasons alone we must welcome this bill and i am sure it will receive a second reading today <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start this evening by adding my congratulations to the noble duke the duke of somerset on his maiden speech <e> <s> i know that he has joined the european communities committee and i hope that he will be contributing to the reports of that committee and also to the debates in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the news that the government have set up tests to investigate the use of bst in dairy cattle but will they pay attention to the results of those tests unlike the findings of the committee set up by the ec under professor lamy to look into the use of growth hormones in these cattle which were totally disregarded <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend sits down i should like to ask one more question <e> <s> it is quite possible for parents to have great difficulty in producing children and to seek other means of achieving parenthood <e> <s> it is quite possible that the father of the child that is born is not the natural parent of the child <e> <s> would he have the responsibilities as laid down in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord dundee for introducing the farm and conservation grant scheme and the farm and conservation grant regulations <e> <s> i welcome the fact that the scheme has been extended to encourage the regeneration of native woodlands and heather moorlands and to assist in the cost of repairs to vernacular buildings <e> <s> one part of the scheme governed by the farm and conservation grant regulations is backed with ec finance <e> <s> it therefore has to be targeted to those who spend at least half their time in agriculture and derive at least half their income from it <e> <s> however the other part of <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate this afternoon calls attention to the problems facing the government and people of hong kong <e> <s> most speakers have concentrated on the two issues that have now acquired a high profile the right of abode in this country of hong kong people with bdtc and bno passports and the extension of democracy in hong kong before <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i am informed that the central electricity generating board has not undertaken any pre-construction work on the hinkley point site <e> <s> however site investigations involving bore-hole drilling have been carried out with the necessary consents and with the knowledge of the local planning authority in order to provide information for the detailed design of the proposed power station structures and the cooling water outlet <e>", "<cs> my lords the cegb has commissioned confirmatory site investigations consisting of the sinking of bore holes to enable tests to be carried out associated with the design and hydrographic survey in the area of the cooling water intake tunnel and outfall culvert <e> <s> the work was commissioned in august and is now almost complete <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the board has placed contracts for some long lead items of equipment <e> <s> the cegb has placed orders for forgings for the reactor pressure vessel in advance of section consent in order to ensure that the equipment is available on site at the appropriate time during the construction programme <e> <s> the cegbs evidence to the hinkley inquiry identified the need for the early ordering of equipment and on day the inquiry was informed of the proposed orders <e>", "<cs> my lords the inquiry was adjourned by the inspector on th september to enable objectors time to consider evidence presented to the inquiry by the cegb <e> <s> the inspector will reconvene the inquiry on th november to allow the objectors time to cross-examine the cegb witness <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his kind words and i regret that i failed to thank the noble lord for his kind words <e> <s> i do that now <e>", "<cs> my lords the inspector has received evidence on all terms of the building of this power station <e> <s> the secretary of state will need to consider the inspectors report very carefully but will announce his decision as soon as he can <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government published a green paper entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been a great number of responses to the green paper <e> <s> they are still arriving in significant numbers <e> <s> i understand that in excess of have been received <e> <s> as can be imagined these will take time to assess <e> <s> the noble baroness also referred to scandinavia which is in the central european time zone <e> <s> the movement of britain to single/double summer time would have that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords greece is one further on from central european time <e> <s> longitude has to be taken into account as it does in america <e> <s> it is a question of latitude which single/double summer time refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend referred to the time that the clocks go back in europe <e> <s> harmonisation would make us put our clocks back if we did not move to single double time at that date <e> <s> that has found no favour <e> <s> however if we moved to single/double summer time we should have gmt plus one all the year round and gmt plus two for the summer time and bringing the clocks back at the end of september would not be as difficult as it is now <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a fair point <e> <s> this will i am sure be one of the responses among the replies made to the consultation document <e> <s> it is just such a point and many others that will have to be considered <e>", "<cs> i take the point <e> <s> i know that there is opposition to these changes in the north and especially in the north east of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords it is too soon to decide how best to deal with the next stage <e> <s> as i have said the responses to the green paper are still coming in <e> <s> once these have been assessed it will be possible to see if they add any new information on the issues or whether they represent in the most part votes for one of the three options <e> <s> how the results are disseminated will no doubt depend on the result of the assessment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that will be one of the considerations that will be carefully considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can agree with the noble lord <e> <s> however i am certain that such representations will be fed in and that the home office will consider them extremely carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be happy to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords that is true <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy meets the chairman of british coal regularly to discuss all aspects of the coal industry <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the governments policy to restrict imports of coal <e> <s> it would be wrong to compel coal users to purchase supplies from british coal by denying them the right to buy from elsewhere <e> <s> restricting competition will not bring long-term security to the british coal industry and the best protection is to produce reliable supplies which are competitive on the world market <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree <e> <s> it is important to put the imports of coal into context <e> <s> during the past two years coal imports of about million tonnes per annum have amounted to only per cent <e> <s> of inland consumption <e> <s> over per cent <e> <s> of the imports are coking coal for the iron and steel industry <e> <s> they are needed because the uk pits can no longer supply sufficient quantities to meet our industries requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords the output of british coal has remained constant for five years despite the closures <e> <s> the productivity has risen enormously <e> <s> however the productivity of our main competitors that is australia and the united states is still more than three times as high and improving rapidly <e> <s> there must be further productivity growth if the industry is to compete successfully and that means the continued spread of more flexible working methods <e>", "<cs> my lords the prices quoted by the noble lord may be correct <e> <s> it is still a fact that coal imports are substantially below the pithead price of coal in this country <e> <s> the government have invested billion in the coal industry since <e> <s> we are continuing to invest at over million every working day because we have faith in british coal and in the ability of management and men to improve performance still further <e> <s> i believe that that is a fine record <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is suggesting that we are trying to reduce the amount of coal produced by the pits <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> the amount of coal being produced remains at about million tonnes per annum <e> <s> the future supplies to the electricity supply industry are now under renegotiation but we are committed to their remaining a major part of its fuel supplies in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have tried to explain since the operating costs have fallen by per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e> <s> british coal has fully achieved the objective of a per cent <e> <s> reduction set by the secretary of state in march <e> <s> however continuing improvements can and must be made if british coal is to be fully competitive <e>", "<cs> my lords the question put to me by the noble lord the leader of the opposition is wide of that on the order paper concerning imported coal <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the social effects are important and british coal has sought to alleviate them wherever possible <e> <s> it still remains that the production of coal must be competitive <e> <s> i reiterate that the percentage of coal imported is coking coal which cannot be economically produced at this moment in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i note my noble friends comment <e>", "<cs> my lords the construction of new nuclear power stations in england and wales is a matter for the cegb <e> <s> in considering any application for his consent to the building of a new power station the secretary of state will consider all relevant factors including the report of any public inquiry held <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe that nuclear power has a vital strategic role to play in achieving security of supply <e> <s> nuclear and renewables help to limit the damage which burning fossil fuels does to the environment <e> <s> energy efficiency is not an alternative to building power stations <e> <s> both are needed <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct <e> <s> fossil fuels are not without their hidden costs <e> <s> burning coal has environmental costs in terms of acid rain and the greenhouse effect as my noble friend has said <e> <s> the cost of coal-fired <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> we need all the nuclear engineers possible both now and in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to comment on those figures <e> <s> what i will say to the noble lord is that the governments aim is to help to secure british coals future as a competitive supplier <e> <s> we believe that british coal can be a competitive fuel <e> <s> the government invest more than million a day in british coal and have invested billion since <e> <s> those who supply fuel to the electricity industry will have to ensure that they are competitive <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the house would not expect me to continue with these speculative items <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> the french electricity industry relies enormously upon the pwrs that it has built <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is right to say that the government have never denied that nuclear power is more expensive than fossil-generated power <e> <s> that is the reason for the non-fossil fuel obligation and the fossil fuel levy <e> <s> electricity customers benefit from the diversity of supply that nuclear provides <e> <s> the government believe that those who benefit should contribute to the cost <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me a number of questions <e> <s> the government have decided that the public electricity supply companies should fulfil the non-fossil fuel obligation <e> <s> the cost of nuclear fuel as i said is recognised to be higher than that of fuel produced from the fossil fuels <e> <s> i also said that there are some other costs involved with generating electricity from fossil fuels which have not been taken into account so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend is correct <e> <s> in the construction of any new nuclear power station all the costs and the requirements for the industry will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that document is also confidential <e> <s> i am sure the house would not expect me to comment on the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i do not believe that nuclear fuel poses the environmental dangers that he suggests <e> <s> i should also say that yes we need energy efficiency but that does not mean that we need to reduce the amount of power generated <e>", "<cs> my lords the independent broadcasting authority has a duty to ensure that programmes from each station meet the needs of the local population <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is right <e> <s> this is a matter for the iba <e> <s> that body has regard to the proposals for a suitable service to increase local listener choice on a self-financing and technically sound basis <e>", "<cs> my lords it was an iba decision after representations from and negotiations with the turkish community <e> <s> the proposed new radio authority will be expected to invite proposals for a large number of new stations across the country some of which will serve ethnic communities <e> <s> account will be taken of audience demand and the availability of frequencies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble viscount is correct <e> <s> i believe that prosecutions have been made in that case <e>", "<cs> my lords negotiations are taking place with all parts of the electricity industry on the future arrangements for the supply of nuclear power <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have never denied the fact that nuclear power is more expensive than fossil-generated power <e> <s> however nuclear has a vital strategic role to play in security of supply <e> <s> it is because of these additional costs that we need the non-fossil fuel obligation <e> <s> electricity customers benefit from diversity of supply that nuclear provides <e>", "<cs> my lords the costs mentioned by the noble lord lord hatch are still subject to negotiations between the generating companies and the supply companies <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend may have the number wrong <e> <s> i believe that we have only eight magnox stations although we may have more reactors <e> <s> however i take his point and i shall pass on his comments to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not comment on every speculative figure which is bandied about <e> <s> many of the figures which are quoted and requoted in the press <e>", "<cs> my lords they are wild guesses and others certainly manifest errors and inaccuracies <e> <s> the level of fossil and non-fossil fuel prices and as a consequence the rate of any levy are the subject of negotiations now taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that what is quoted in the paper may be one thing but i am not prepared to speculate on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always grateful to my noble and learned friend for his wise counsel <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said that negotiations are taking place on the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said to the noble lord that the figures which he quotes may contain some truth <e> <s> however what is important is that there is nothing which i shall say to confirm or deny them <e> <s> they are subject to negotiations between the power generators and the suppliers <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat what i have already said negotiations are taking place and i cannot pre-empt their outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration of commons amendments be adjourned until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration of commons amendments be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration of commons amendments be now adjourned <e> <s> in moving this motion perhaps i may suggest that the house does not return to this business until five minutes past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords the energy efficiency obligations that the electricity act imposes on the privatised supply companies and the office of electricity regulation will bring more resources to bear on the promotion of energy efficiency <e> <s> resources for the governments energy efficiency office are reviewed each year in the public expenditure survey <e> <s> a statement on the outcome of this years survey will be made shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures for the next three years will be announced shortly <e> <s> however my right honourable friend the prime minister reaffirmed the governments commitment to energy efficiency at the united nations yesterday <e> <s> at the department of energy we have refocused our information programme in order to provide specific information and advice on energy management in key industrial sectors and among major users in industrial areas <e> <s> the key is our new best practice programme and the work of our regional energy efficiency officers <e>", "<cs> my lords the government accepted that nuclear power alone was not going to solve the threat of global warming but recognised that nuclear power had a positive role to play in helping to curtail future carbon dioxide emissions <e> <s> however we believe that energy efficiency nuclear power and other non-fossil sources are complementary rather than competitive means to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the last comments of the noble lord <e> <s> however the government accept that all forms of energy production and use have some environmental consequences <e> <s> energy efficiency helps to keep these to a minimum <e> <s> that is one good reason among many for the governments continuing programme of work for the energy efficiency office <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble and learned friend <e> <s> one of the consequences of affluence is the need for more energy <e> <s> however we can mitigate the increase of generating more power by energy conservation <e>", "<cs> my lordsi belive that french nuclear energy is outside the scope of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an extremely interesting question and i shall bring my noble friends remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords eventually the consumer will dictate his requirements in the energy which he uses <e> <s> we are encouraging the manufacturers of white goods to display how much energy is consumed by each of their products <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> we believe that the government should provide the right information <e> <s> the consumer should use energy as he thinks best <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that those figures are correct <e> <s> however the consumer is not given the choice when he uses energy <e> <s> it is in his interests to use less energy if he can <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has raised an interesting point <e> <s> renewables will form part of future electricity generation but they can provide only a small proportion of the energy required <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true to say that the reduction largely reflects the success to date of the energy efficiency office programmes in raising consumer awareness <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> with leave i shall also speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and to <e> <s> i may incur the wrath of the noble lord lord airedale but i intend to refer to amendment no <e> <s> a tabled in the name of the noble lord lord peston

necessary whether the new provisions in the bill will relate to cases which are already being dealt with under the provisions of the existing law <e> <s> this is necessary to avoid any possibility of a different set of rules applying half-way through action on a reference or report <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> which would make the regulations detailing the system of fees provided for in clause subject to negative rather than affirmative resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first congratulate the noble lord lord kearton on bringing this motion before your lordships and the other members of the sub-committee for their thorough and if i may say so perceptive report on relations between the community and japan <e> <s> that report and the debate we have had this afternoon demonstrate the importance which the united kingdom attaches to close and positive relations between the community and japan to an informed understanding of japan as a political and economic partner and to the lessons for the community in the commercial and technological successes of the japanese people <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that the figure i gave was the correct figure <e> <s> i do not think i should comment on whether or not it is adequate <e> <s> when fully operational this scheme will double the output of

development will however be needed to achieve an actual sustained net output of power as well as all the engineering development needed for a viable commercial fusion power reactor <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct that work on fusion around the world is still only at the stage of establishing whether the process is scientifically feasible <e> <s> studies suggest that a successful fusion reactor could have environmental and safety advantages but fusion cannot be available before the middle of the next century <e> <s> if anything is to be done over the next or years we shall need to use the technologies that are now available <e>", "<cs> my lords the government judge that there is not a need to accelerate the pace of fusion research <e> <s> they need to assess very carefully all the results from the jet programme and other experiments and the likely timescale for which fusion power may be needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the jet council has agreed to seek a further extension of the life of the joint undertaking from to <e> <s> it is too early to say how the proposal is likely to be viewed by this government or by other member states <e>

kingdom will play a full part in the subsequent discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall find out about the mid-december date and write to the noble lord <e> <s> in the meantime i can say that the government are committed to their million funding this year and their participation as a host nation <e> <s> they are also committed to their contribution towards the european funding of the jet programme and see no reason to cut down on it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think that my noble friend is entirely correct <e> <s> it is such a long-term project that it needs careful assessment at each stage <e> <s> we should certainly not be prepared to go to the next stage without fully assessing the results of jet so far <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> the original

question to which i do not have the answer at the moment <e> <s> i shall undertake to discover the answer and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to tell my noble friend that there is no evidence that the cegbs cost estimate was correct <e> <s> separating the grid is central to bringing forward competition and so to reducing costs <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another detailed question to which i do not have the answer <e> <s> i shall have to undertake to write to my noble friend <e> <s> of course i shall send a copy to the noble lord lord williams <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall indeed take away from this debate everything that noble lords have said <e> <s> i undertake to talk to my right honourable friend and explain to him the concerns that come not only from behind me but from opposite sides of the house <e> <s> i think that as the one replying to this debate it is my duty to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i shall be dealing with that notion in my speech <e> <s> the nuclear industry has provided a lifeline to this country three times in the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords the private sector and the public sector require different rates of return <e> <s> it is therefore quite right to think that the nuclear power stations in the public sector will not have to stand the full rigours of the interest rates required by the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i have dealt with many of these problems <e> <s> i have tried to help the noble lord whenever possible but i should like to continue with my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have dealt with the reasons the agrs and the pwrs have not been left in the hands of the public <e> <s> i should now like to continue with my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords again i

warm support of police voluntary organisations and the drinks industry <e> <s> it forms part of our year-round programme of events and measures to strengthen the trend against drinking and driving and to cut the quite unacceptable deaths and injuries that it causes <e>", "<cs> my lords calls for random breath testing reflect the welcome hardening of societys attitude towards the drinking driver <e> <s> the police have asked for unfettered discretion to administer tests and a recent consultation exercise showed wide support for a change in the law <e> <s> the home secretary is now considering how best to take that forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm that drinking and driving resulted in approximately deaths last year <e> <s> it is the biggest single cause of road accident casualties <e> <s> my noble friend has put forward an interesting hypothesis which i shall bear in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have not seen that report <e>", "<cs> my lords the government welcome the recent announcement by the magistrates association that it intends to produce revised guidelines on sentencing road traffic offenders <e> <s> of course it is for the courts alone to decide on the appropriate sentence within the maximum penalities set by parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the present limit is the level at which for most drivers the chance of being involved in an accident starts to rise sharply <e> <s> therefore i believe that priority must continue to be given to enforcing the present limit <e>", "<cs> my lords we should all be grateful that there are so many sober drivers on the roads <e> <s> however i believe it is unwise not to pursue those who drive and drink and unwise not to try to discourage them <e> <s> that is what the campaign launched on th december is intended to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may be interested to know that there were roadside breath tests in per cent <e> <s> more than in <e> <s> the home secretary will take into <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct <e> <s> a police officer may stop a motorist and ask for a breath test to be carried out following an accident and following a moving traffic offence <e> <s> it is also lawful for a police officer to slop any car if he suspects that the driver may have been drinking <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have the figures for which the noble lord is asking <e> <s> however i believe that his words of wisdom especially at this time of the year are very apt <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the government will take into consideration everything which the noble lord has said <e> <s> i should also mention that there are roadside surveys carried out every year by the road research laboratory although it does not have the force of the police <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend has made an extremely valuable point <e> <s> of course the police investigate cases of careless driving and one of the measures which they are obliged to take when they find an accident is to give the drivers involved a breath test <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will consider whether any changes of law or practice need to be made in the light of the recommendations of the judicial inquiry presided over by sir john may <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> under english common law and since under the police and criminal evidence act of that year before a confession can be heard in evidence the prosecution has to satisfy a court that it has been obtained without oppression and not in circumstances which would otherwise render it unreliable <e> <s> this was on a recommendation of the criminal law revision committee which at the time it reported had the scottish law available to examine <e> <s> i repeat that the inquiry has been framed wide

mentioned in my answer utilities and others licensed to excavate the streets are required to restore the surface of the road or footpath only to its original surface level <e> <s> that is often a temporary restoration <e> <s> the highway authority has the right to carry out the permanent restoration at a later stage or it may allow the utility to do so <e> <s> most authorities elect to do so

a great deal of sympathy for what my noble friend says but the act is now in force <e> <s> however i understand that the department of transport has made proposals to local authority associations and utilities for joint development of a computerised street works register <e> <s> i am sure that once that task has been undertaken the concerns held by many noble lords about roads being dug up once

losses and long-term liabilities <e> <s> it will recognise the true earnings potential of the corporations colliery assets in a competitive market and it recognises that there will need to be further

seeking to stress that there would be million additional pieces of data to record per annum and there is a cost involved in that <e> <s> the government deplore the practice of car clocking but they do not accept that the answer is to require the declaration and the recording to millions upon millions of additional items of information every year <e> <s> when the working party under the chairmanship of the director general of the office of fair trading first came up with this proposal in the then minister for roads and traffic explained these difficulties and invited the working party to look at

electricity industry with the muddle as he sees it <e> <s> the electricity industry is going through a radical change <e> <s> it is certainly not as he describes it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the transmission lines remain as a natural monopoly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stoddart asked a number of questions including the question why should the nuclear industry be removed <e> <s> that was dealt with on a previous occasion <e> <s> as i have already explained it was the view of the proposed purchasers of the industry who required a high rate of return in order to undertake all the unknown decommissioning costs which also had to be sold <e> <s> nuclear electricity will provide a return on its investments appropriate to the public sector <e> <s> in order to do so the cost of generating nuclear electricity is higher than that from fossil fuels <e> <s> part of the reason is because the damage to the environment caused by fossil fuel generation is not costed in the price of electricity <e> <s> the emissions of co <e>", "<cs> my lords the renewables will form an important part of the supply of electricity <e> <s> this is being greatly encouraged by the government as i have stressed <e> <s> the difficulty is that there are not enough renewable sources to make an impact on the requirement of electricity for the industry of this country <e> <s> our supplies cannot be guaranteed from renewables <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord peston will be grateful to know that the price control is designed to keep prices constant during the years that i have mentioned in order that opportunities will exist for competition which could bring them down <e> <s> the price formula rpi is not a constant figure but a percentage figure <e> <s> therefore y is an important element and it is the pass-through costs <e>", "<cs> my lords this statement is one of a progression of statements bringing into being electricity privatisation <e> <s> as i explained earlier we are on course for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e> <s> i suggest that the report stage begins again at minutes past eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords the government consider that it is more appropriate for the british technology group to be in the private sector <e> <s> this would however require primary legislation and

debate on the subject of utility street works <e> <s> the subject is not a new one as the noble lord lord tordoff said when he quoted from the preface of the home report although the degree of public

britain in were classed as company cars <e> <s> i regret figures relating to the united kingdom are not available <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that per cent <e> <s> of new cars

<e> <s> if the company car market is eroded then uk-based companies will have the most to lose as overall sales fall while the level of import penetration is likely to rise <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the remarks of my noble friend but the governments policy is that buying british without regard to value for money would insulate suppliers from competitive forces <e> <s> it would be against the car industrys long-term interests and it would almost certainly conflict with our international obligations <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that so far as these figures are concerned

production has dropped from a level of million in to million in <e> <s> that is a drop of one-third <e> <s> it has now risen to million and we hope with continued investment especially from abroad it will rise to million by the mid-s <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole business of company cars is rather complicated because company car registrations do not include registrations by self-employed persons

the past that is the deficit which has mounted up to the end of march and the asset write-down required in order to put british coal on a better footing for the future <e> <s> i have already explained the difficulty about the use of the work shall instead of may <e> <s> the sums are imprecise because they will be paid out for concessionary coal and deafness only as and when they occur <e>", "<cs> the balance sheet will be struck at the end of march <e> <s> however the amounts involved will not be known until the report is published much later in the year <e>", "<cs> first i should say to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton that the government have no intention of writing down the amount of money put forward for deafness claims or concessionary coal <e> <s> i believe that i should make that perfectly clear <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that there is much dividing us <e> <s> the balance sheet will show the estimated liability it has for those two items for the deafness claims and concessionary coal both to employed and retired miners <e> <s> however it cannot provide for future demands of people yet to be employed or yet to become deaf <e>", "<cs> i think i can agree with the noble lord <e> <s> clause talks about the accumulated group deficit up to the period ending end of march <e> <s> the corporations accounting policy states that account is taken of its latent liability for noise induced hearing loss <e> <s> therefore that takes account of its expected liability arising from its operations to date not just liabilities relating to claims which it has already received <e> <s> i hope that makes the matter clearer <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord has said <e> <s> if he has any specific instances that he would like to bring to my attention i can guarantee that i shall pass it higher up the chain if i may so put it <e> <s> as the noble lord says british coal provides concessionary fuel under the national concessionary fuel agreement which was signed with the num <e> <s> the corporation considers this agreement to be legally binding <e> <s> i do not think that there is anything more that i can say about that <e> <s> we are talking about the provision of sums of money in the accounts due at the end of march to provide for this concessionary coal <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would delay any payment of grant until british coal had completed and published a full revaluation of its assets <e> <s> i can understand the noble lords desire to know more about the asset write-downs given the large figures that may be involved <e> <s> however this amendment would delay the payment of any deficiency grant <e>", "<cs> i was seeking to explain that the corporation was revising its business plans for its collieries and needed to adjust the detailed valuations in the light of that <e> <s> obviously these are some of the fixed assets the noble lord was speaking of <e> <s> these detailed valuations will not be finalised until the corporations accounts have been approved by its board and reported on by its auditors which at the earliest will be in july and this year may be rather later than normal <e>", "<cs> i stress that the accounts are based on the historic cost convention which i think the noble lord accepts and that it is the duty of the board and the auditors to make certain that if there has been a permanent diminution of value the words he quoted they should take that into account <e> <s> those things have not been taken into account over the past few years <e> <s> it is in order to bring it into line with that permanent diminution that the reassessment has been made this year <e>", "<cs> i will take the three points one by one <e> <s> it is up to british coal to make a valuation <e> <s> the method of valuation is the lower of the cost and net recoverable values <e> <s> that is a matter between british coal and its auditors <e>", "<cs> this amendment appears to introduce a new grant going beyond the scope of deficiency grant and to impose a new charge on public revenues <e> <s> clause of the bill is intended to introduce a deficiency grant to eliminate the corporations accumulated group deficit at st march to enable the secretary of state for energy to continue properly to advance loans to the corporation <e> <s> under generally accepted accounting practice further development costs cannot be taken into account when calculating this deficit and therefore would not be eligible for deficiency grant <e> <s> the sums which british coal has already incurred on research and development into clean coal technology will be extinguished by deficiency grant <e> <s> this has been rising in recent years <e> <s> british coal has had a coal utilisation rd budget of around million a year and within that the environmentally related work has risen from under per cent in to nearly per cent <e> <s> now <e> <s> british coal has also spent nearly million on the grimethorpe test rig over the past three years which will now be extinguished by deficiency grant <e>", "<cs> if i may take the last question first i am not in a position to do so now but i take note of what the noble lord says and i shall investigate further <e> <s> i shall write to him on the subject <e> <s> it was one of a series of examples of how the government are seeking to improve the technology <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord with the details <e>", "<cs> no i am not prepared to say that there will be massive imports of coal in the future <e>", "<cs> it is perhaps just one way of dealing with this particular directive <e> <s> it is up to the industry to take note of the large combustion plant directive and arrange its affairs so that it can comply with it <e> <s> i have given the noble lord an indication of how that can be done in other ways <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i am sorry to take issue with the noble lord <e> <s> i am not saying that what the secretary of state said was not correct <e> <s> i am saying that in order to do what the noble lord has suggested and with no other means at all then the secretary of state could be correct <e> <s> i do not see that there will have to be massive imports of low sulphur coal because there are other means of dealing with the problem including the retro-fitting of the flue gas desulphurisation equipment <e>", "<cs> it is axiomatic that all fossil fuels are of a limited nature we are not making any more <e> <s> how we use them for the generation of power has to be taken into account when we look at the environmental nature of the burning of fossil fuels <e> <s> coal has a deleterious effect on our environment <e>", "<cs> i take note of what the noble lord says <e> <s> i remind him that we also have a nuclear industry as well for the provision of electrical power <e>", "<cs> in fact i mentioned about four forms of research for clean coal combustion <e> <s> the government are providing a substantial amount of money for these technologies <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned acid rain and asked what we intend to do about that <e> <s> it was to that question that i addressed the remarks that the polluter should pay <e>", "<cs> i can understand the wish of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton to know more about the possible closure or reorganisation of collieries and the consequential effect on the workforce <e> <s> however the fact is that there is no master plan for colliery closures <e> <s> moreover if there were one it would change so frequently and radically as not to be very meaningful <e> <s> i do not dispute that there may be some collieries which are physically running out of all economically recoverable coal where you can truthfully say within a given timescale this pit will close <e> <s> that is a fact of life <e> <s> the workforce and the local community can take it fully into account in their plans for other jobs <e> <s> however in most cases there are simply too many imponderables <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord dormand of easington does not need reminding that british coal has managed to produce approximately million tonnes of coal over the last five years <e> <s> there has been an enormous increase in productivity which has led to some jobs being lost by way of voluntary redundancies <e>", "<cs> if i did not pay tribute to the miners in my second reading speech that is a matter that i regret <e> <s> i should have done so and i should now like to put that matter right <e>", "<cs> the effect of the first two amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and is to reduce the limit on licensed mine operations <e> <s> the present limit of men would apply to total manpower at the mine which includes surface workers and management staff not simply the manpower employed to work underground as at present <e> <s> we cannot accept this <e> <s> i explained in the second reading debate why the government felt that an increase in the licence limits was desirable in terms of increasing the output of specialist coals enhancing competition and creating jobs in depressed mining areas <e> <s> i am sad that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton did not attempt to address the position on jobs <e>", "<cs> it is always useful to have in the chamber someone who has direct experience of the matters that we are discussing <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord tryon for his experiences which he has recounted today <e> <s> to some extent he used the words which i should have used or which i sought to use <e> <s> he illustrated that with the constraint on the number of men being allowed to work underground the revenue is not available to invest in the capital machinery that i am talking about <e>", "<cs> the situation is not quite as the noble lord suggested <e> <s> the health and safety executive recently put forward proposals to the health and safety commission which if implemented in their present form would include a requirement for a higher ratio of first aiders to persons employed below ground than is currently required <e> <s> however the proposals would not require a deputy to hold a first aid certificate <e> <s> the commission is currently considering those proposals <e> <s> it is not a <e>", "<cs> the amendment would have the effect of restricting the increase in tonnage limit to tonnes making a new limit of tonnes <e>", "<cs> the two amendments tabled by the noble lord lord graham require british coal to satisfy itself that undertakings have been <e>", "<cs> i fully recognise the importance of the issue that lies behind this amendment <e> <s> mine safety is and always must be of paramount importance <e> <s> i agree entirely that mines must be run only by those who are fitted to run them <e> <s> however it would be inappropriate to use the bill to impose mandatory sanctions for offences which are not directly related to its subject <e> <s> the safety regulations governing the mining industry are part of the health and safety at work legislation <e> <s> also this amendment does not distinguish sufficiently between serious offences and those of a trivial nature <e> <s> it would be quite iniquitous if a company were effectively to be put out of business simply because it had committed a relatively minor misdemeanour <e>", "<cs> as regards sums owed to government and to banks the purpose of clause of the bill is to recognise that the corporations asset base has been severely eroded by the events of recent years and to restore the corporation to a position where the secretary of state can properly continue to advance loans to meet its day-to-day cash requirements <e> <s> it is not the intention to eliminate all the corporations debt only that part which cannot be adequately remunerated by its activities <e>", "<cs> this amendment on environmental responsibilities tabled by my noble friends lord norrie and lord renton the noble baronesses lady david and lady stedman and indeed the other amendment tabled by the noble lords lord graham of edmonton and lord williams of elvel which we will be discussing later this evening are important ones and we have considered them carefully <e>", "<cs> i shall deal with the last point first <e> <s> all mining whether opencast or deep-mining requires planning permission and however large or small the site that planning permission is under the guidance of the mineral planning authority guidance the mpg which i have mentioned <e> <s> as regards the other point which my noble friend lord renton raised i tried to stress in my remarks the fact that the government consider british coal as the licensor has a different function to play in this whole matter from that of the planning authority <e> <s> i sought to stress that in agreement with my noble friend lord forester the planning authority is the right body to give planning permission and that <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government do not order power stations <e> <s> they have therefore not cancelled any order for the proposed hinkley point c station to which i believe the noble viscount refers <e> <s> the cegbs proposals for that station were the subject of a public inquiry the report of which is expected in the next few months <e> <s> the government have however made it clear that the non-fossil fuel obligation will be set at a level which can be satisfied without the need for new nuclear stations beyond sizewell b the government intend to review the prospects for nuclear power in <e> <s> in the meantime there is ample time for new generating capacity to be built to meet the expected increase in demand foreseen for the latter part of this decade <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously if no further capacity is built there is a rundown of existing stations <e> <s> that is to be expected <e> <s> the noble viscount will understand that the next nuclear power station will be commissioned sometime during the earlier part of the next decade and that the number and type of new power stations will now be determined in the market-place by a variety of factors including projections for the future electricity supply-demand balance made by both generators and public suppliers <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the completion of the first pwr reactor is important <e> <s> it also keeps our nuclear option open <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord will be pleased to know that the department has received no less than applications for consideration for renewable source supply <e> <s> these have meant that the department requires another two months before setting the tranche of that non-fossil fuel obligation at a level which can be undertaken by some of those projections <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that at the moment some gigawatts of energy are already being produced by combined heat and power plants <e> <s> there is an interest in a number of others <e> <s> i have details of some which are now just up and running <e> <s> the department of energy is keen to see renewable energy taking its place among all the other sources <e>", "<cs> my lords nuclear electric will not build any new stations before when the review of nuclear energy will be undertaken <e> <s> its immediate priority is to run its existing stations safely and efficiently and to complete sizewell b to turn to the other part of the noble lords question my right honourable friend is awaiting the inspectors report on hinkley point c in view of his quasi-judicial position i cannot comment on the application <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i have already answered that question <e> <s> my right honourable friend is awaiting the inspectors report on hinkley point c <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> as i explained to the noble lord on a previous occasion a review of the costs of sizewell b is being undertaken and is not yet complete <e> <s> i gave him on a previous occasion the figure of billion <e>", "<cs> my lords the licence conditions on all suppliers will enshrine the current standards of security <e> <s> they will also ensure that suppliers provide sufficient information to the director general of electricity supply to enable him to take a view on the levels of security provided <e> <s> if he believes that levels of security must be increased he can seek modifications to the licence conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw the remarks of the noble lord to the attention of my noble friend the leader of the house <e> <s> in the meantime i beg to move that further consideration <e>", "<cs> we welcome these technical amendments which as the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale has said simply take account of the fact that the scots have their own albeit very similar definition of a document <e>", "<cs> again we welcome this minor amendment which seeks simply to remove a reference in the gaming act to a repealed scottish statute <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate my noble friends lord norrie and lord renton and the noble baronesses lady david and lady stedman on the persuasiveness and sincerity with which they successfully proposed their amendment in committee last week <e> <s> i also wish to thank them for the revised amendment which has now been tabled and which fully takes into account all difficulties which i mentioned last week <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that i think the noble lord is concerned about the restoration of the sites that are worked by opencast because that is really what the amendment refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained in committee i am confident that the current definition of deficiency grant will make sufficient grant available to achieve its objective of enabling the secretary of state properly to continue to advance loans <e> <s> perhaps i should initially deal briefly with the first two paragraphs of the amendment so <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment requires british coal to satisfy itself as licensor that licensed opencast mining operations comply with air quality limits on sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates <e> <s> i shall deal with the question of dust in a moment <e> <s> our basic objection to the amendment is as elsewhere that it puts the obligation on british coal as licensor to satisfy itself whether the licensee has had adequate regard to the environmental implications of his operation a point brought up by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> in the governments view that is a matter for the planning system not for the licensee <e> <s> i shall refer to that in more detail in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e> <s> i think that i should point out that the coshh control of substances hazardous to health regulations came into force last year <e> <s> they place a further duty on employers to regulate their own areas <e> <s> if there is a complaint from an employee the health and safety executive and an inspector will investigate the matter and levels will be monitored by a medical division <e> <s> in general cases if dust levels are found to be too high the cause will be stopped until remedied <e> <s> in extreme cases the operations will be stopped on site <e> <s> levels are kept down by the seeding of topsoil baffle banks and the use of road sprays <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord underhill and other noble lords who have spoken in this debate for the general welcome which has basically been given to the regulations <e> <s> it would be useful if i started by addressing a few remarks to the sale of the register which was a point mentioned by all speakers <e> <s> the electoral registration officer has a duty to prepare and publish in each year a register of electors for the area in which he acts <e> <s> to do so he relies upon the information provided by householders in the electoral registration form form a he is obliged to make a copy of the electoral register available for inspection in each electoral area <e> <s> that is to enable members of the public to check that their names are included and if they so wish to ensure that any names about which they have doubts are not included <e> <s> it is a procedure fairly fundamental to the democratic process <e> <s> the ero must also provide free copies of the register to the local member of parliament parliamentary candidates and local councillors <e> <s> if there are any copies remaining he is required to supply a part or the whole of the register to any person upon payment of a prescribed fee <e> <s> those provisions reflect the fact that the electoral register is a public document in wide circulation for electoral purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that question is no <e> <s> in designing a form it is necessary to strike a balance between essential guidance to complete the form properly and helpful information <e>", "<cs> my lords it is up to the noble lord to write to such people and ask them not to include his name on the register for junk mail <e> <s> obviously that option is open to any individual citizen <e>", "<cs> my lords it has to be a question of balance <e> <s> the government have decided that the balance should be between what is in the interest of the consumer and what is not <e> <s> the noble lord may feel that being on a list to receive junk mail is not in the interest of the consumer but there are other concerns for credit reference agencies which from the advice i have would be in the interests of the consumer <e> <s> the consumers association and the office of fair trading have gone along with that idea <e> <s> therefore one needs to create a balance and that is what the government have sought to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that can go much further along this line <e> <s> the printed copy of the register is not data for the purposes of the data protection act <e> <s> the information recorded for that purpose is displayed in the hard copy which is made available to the public <e> <s> that is the information which may be collected and processed by a word processor or computerised machinery <e> <s> what is stored is printed as the printed copy and therefore it is not data for the purposes of the data protection act <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not feel that i can go any further <e> <s> i am advised that the printed copy of the register is not data for the purposes of the data protection act <e>", "<cs> my lords i really feel that i ought to go on to other points <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may help to clear the slightly muddy waters into which we have plunged <e> <s> the law requires the register to be published <e> <s> the register having been made public it can no longer be treated as confidential under the data protection act <e> <s> i hope that that satisfies the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the third motion standing in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the fourth motion standing in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the fifth motion standing in my name <e>", "<cs> my

referred to the producers guidelines <e> <s> it is the fact that viewers and listeners might see or hear a programme which represents a particular point of view but may not necessarily hear the

will certainly draw to the attention of the chairman of the bbc the remarks made in your lordships house today <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for raising this important subject today <e> <s> we have had a most informative and wide-ranging debate on the noble baronesss motion during which a number of noble lords have shown themselves to be both knowledgeable and appreciative of the work of citizens advice bureaux <e> <s> a number of interesting points have been made and some questions have been raised and i should now like to respond on behalf of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am content to undertake to bring that point which was not only reinforced by the right reverend prelate but also mentioned by the noble lord lord irvine of lairg to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords in the prototype fast reactor at dounreay generated megawatt days net of electricity earning approximately million in electricity receipts <e> <s> this represents a significant improvement over previous years <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure is a record <e> <s> however the net cost to the government of keeping the pfr plant operating is around million a year <e> <s> to that figure should be added around million to cover the cost of reprocessing and waste management <e> <s> the government concluded that they would not be justified in continuing to spend public funds at that rate beyond march against the likely time-scale of commercial introduction of the technology nor on the acquisition of additional technical information <e> <s> by the main design work on the european fast reactor will be complete and operating experience gained from the pfr thereafter will be less beneficial <e>", "<cs> my lords the government stated in that they would continue the work on the prototype fast reactor until and on the reprocessing plant until and would scale down the amount of money spent on rd mostly as a support to the design team for the european fast reactor to million for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the design work for the european fast reactor is carried out by design companies in the collaboration countries that is the united kingdom france and germany and is paid for largely by the utilities <e> <s> it started in march with the conceptual design phase and it is planned to start the three-year concepts validation phase in april of this year <e> <s> the european fast reactor utilities group will review the position in at which time it will be decided

the directives requirements by retrofitting fgd equipment if i may use that phrase to gigawatts of capacity <e> <s> however the advantages of combined cycle gas turbines particularly their environmental benefits have also become more widely appreciated <e> <s> fgd retrofits will continue to form a part of the uks programme for complying with the directive but other measures will also contribute <e>", "<cs> my lords the burning of low-sulphur coal is an option open to the electricity generators as they prepare their plans to comply with the european community large combustion plant directive <e> <s> the source of such coal will be a matter for the generators <e> <s> the best protection for the united kingdom coal industry is for it to produce reliable supplies which are competitive on the world market <e>", "<cs> my lords the order for the first four gigawatts that i mentioned in my original answer was placed in february <e> <s> the capital cost of the programme and of further retrofits which will be required will be reflected in the capital structure of the two generators when they are marketed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should point out that fgd technology is a retrograde technology and is environmentally disruptive <e> <s> for instance the fgd installation at a two gigawatt coal-fired power station would require some tonnes of limestone per annum <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can go any further than i went in my original answer <e> <s> i must reiterate that the united kingdom government will comply with the ec directive <e> <s> it is as the noble lord will know part of that directive that we should reduce our emissions in by per cent <e> <s> in by per cent <e> <s> and in by per cunt <e> <s> the last figure which takes us into the next century will allow the construction of the power plants that i discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords first point when i said that it was a retrograde technology i meant that it also had those environmentally disruptive facets <e> <s> not only does it require the extensive mining of limestone the fgd plants produce large quantities of gypsum as a by-product of the operation <e> <s> i gave an example of what a gigawatt station would require in terms of tonnes of limestone <e> <s> it would create between and tonnes of gypsum which would have be removed from the station <e> <s> some of it might be sold but the rest would have to be disposed of to a suitable landfill site <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord for not having answered his second question <e> <s> yes the fluidised bed technique and also coal gasification are the techniques of the future for coal burn <e> <s> a certain amount of investment is being made into the rd of those processes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the last part of the noble lords question <e> <s> the united kingdoms programme for complying with the directive has to be drawn up by the end of june <e> <s> discussions on the achievement of reductions with the generators and others who operate these large combustion plants are nearing completion and final decisions will be taken very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be wrong to say that fitting fgd is a panacea for getting rid of all the greenhouse gases <e> <s> the noble lord will know that in fact it lowers the efficiency of the plants and therefore in order to produce the same amount of power more carbon dioxide will have to be pumped into the atmosphere <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the last question is no <e> <s> flue gas desulphurisation is one of the techniques required to reduce our emissions of sulphur dioxide by the percentages of the ec directive <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from the post office that it produced this leaflet solely for internal purposes to brief its counter staffs that non-value indicator stamps were being issued for domestic mail only <e> <s> before issuing those stamps the post office had notified the international bureau of the universal postal union requesting it to issue a circular to the member administrations asking them to accept any non-value indicator stamps that erroneously appeared overseas <e> <s> the post office has received no comments since that circular was published <e>", "<cs> my lords the post office states that the final paragraph of the leaflet referred to by the noble lord attempted to encapsulate into a single sentence the provisions of the universal postal union convention and the post offices action in informing the upus international bureau through its upu-member postal administration about the issue of nvi stamps <e> <s> the post office now recognises that this simplification was misleading <e> <s> nevertheless it believes that in the context of the leaflet as a whole the paragraph provides sufficient information to equip members of its staff to deal with the public <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a slight inconsistency in what the noble lord says <e> <s> i agree that the stamps were made available before the change <e> <s> it was done on the basis that many retail outlets also sell stamps and it helps customers if they can buy stamps before there is an imminent change about which they know so that they do not have to buy small denomination stamps to make up the difference <e> <s> i have no information to advise the noble lord of any impending increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i indicated that there is some possibility of the public being misled <e> <s> that is why i have said that the post office has now assured us and i repeat the assurance to the house that if it decides to issue books again it will make clear that the stamps are not suitable for overseas mail <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the post office has a commercial interest to pursue <e> <s> it has found it very useful to be able to issue these <e>", "<cs> my lords my last answer indicated the difficulty that there would be in withdrawing the stamps <e> <s> only a limited number of books was issued <e> <s> the noble lord may know that there are crown offices <e> <s> there are sub-offices which are run by independent people under franchise <e> <s> there are small shops which have purchased these books at a discount <e> <s> it would be an extremely difficult operation to withdraw all the books from those shops <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the post office does not require the permission that my noble friend suggests <e> <s> obviously any increase in the postal rates has to be agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords these stamps are obviously of a limited duration and a special colour with a special indicator on them <e> <s> they may or may not in the future have a value much in excess of their face value <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw that interesting suggestion to the attention of the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords the stamps that are issued are not valueless <e> <s> they are non-value indicator stamps <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is the intention of the post office that letters bearing stamps of whatever value should be delivered according to its rules <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps a reflection of the very important public interest issues that are often involved in the transfer of newspapers from one newspaper proprietor to another that we have had the debate in your lordships house today <e> <s> the matters raised by the noble lord lord cocks of hartcliffe are important ones and it is because of these that we have had since first in the monopolies and mergers act and now in the fair trading act special provisions to deal with newspaper transfers <e> <s> these are separate and distinct from those parts of the act which deal with ordinary mergers <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the three concerned are sir alastair burnet mr mark kersen the managing director of a major regional newspaper the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords employers have a right to make inquiries about potential employees and others have a right to collect and supply information to employers <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for those who distribute or receive information to do their best to ensure that it is accurate wherever it comes from <e> <s> if any information is inaccurate as the noble lord suggested was the case that should be taken up with those who collect and supply the information <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords the evidence given by the cegb to the sizewell inquiry included the best cost estimates for the station then available <e>", "<cs> my lords the original cost as given to the layfield committee was billion <e> <s> the noble lord is correct in that regard <e> <s> i have no idea where the noble lord obtained his figure of billion the latest estimate that i have given the house is billion for the completion of sizewell <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have answered the noble lord <e> <s> i said that the relative economics have changed <e> <s> i cannot confirm the figures that the noble lord has given <e> <s> however the secretary of state was fully appraised of all the figures given to him by layfield when he reported and he took the decision on the best available advice <e>", "<cs> my lords in the longer term no one can predict what will happen to fossil prices <e> <s> environmental considerations may well strengthen the economic case for nuclear power <e> <s> unlike other fuels particularly fossil fuels nuclear power bears the environmental costs of the fuel cycle <e> <s> the relative economics of nuclear might improve if a comparable basis were used for fossil fuels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to comment on that but shall not <e> <s> my noble friend is correct over the past to years we have seen quite a see-saw in oil prices <e> <s> i know that even some noble lords opposite would not consider that oil prices would remain at their low level for the next or years <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the costs of building sizewell are being reviewed at the present time <e> <s> that is an ongoing review <e> <s> the review is likely to be completed by the end of this month <e> <s> however it would be reasonable to give nuclear electric time to review the cegb figures <e> <s> nuclear electric is a new company and it needs time to review the figures <e> <s> therefore that review may be delayed by a month or so <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the technology i feel that the secretary of state was confronted with the report of the layfield committee <e> <s> the inspector had in front of him all the available evidence on which to base his judgment <e> <s> he came to the conclusion that the building of sizewell b was the right thing to do at the time <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my noble friend is correct <e> <s> i should point out to the house that sizewell is also a major infrastructure project in its own right <e> <s> it employs some people on site and provides prestige work for british contractors all over the country <e> <s> the project will give uk manufacturers and plant suppliers the experience and capability to compete for similar work in export markets <e> <s> well over per cent <e> <s> of the contracts placed for the construction of the project have gone to uk firms <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i have given a commitment to the house that nuclear electric the successor company to the cegb is at present reviewing the cost of building sizewell <e> <s> that review is not yet complete <e> <s> the figures will be presented to the secretary of state and obviously he will want to consider them before any decision is made as to whether they should be made public and in what form <e>", "<cs> my lords i have answered the noble lords question <e> <s> the evidence was available to layfield when he reported <e> <s> he reported on the evidence that was available to him <e> <s> the noble lord suggests that it would save money if sizewell b were cancelled but it would not <e> <s> some billion of contracts have been placed <e> <s> if we were to cancel the project now the government do not intend to do that we would be involved in termination negotiations on those contracts <e> <s> as a result more money would be expended and i daresay that the site would have to be returned to its original state <e> <s> some cubic metres of concrete have been used on the site and the removal of that would be considered to be rather a waste of money <e>", "<cs> my lords i refer the noble lord to my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the amounts of money invested in the north sea this year will be decided by the companies involved <e> <s> the indications are that exploration and appraisal activity could reach an all time record and capital investment which grew at over per cent <e> <s> to reach - billion in is expected to maintain this rapid growth in <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that my noble friend may have his figures a little awry <e> <s> according to my information a figure of - billion of investment is reported by the national economic development office in <e> <s> nearly billion of investment in new north sea projects has been approved by the department of energy over the past two years and the lions share of that investment is supplied by uk industry adding to employment particularly in scotland the north east of england and the london area <e>", "<cs> my lords offshore safety is one of the considerations which the government have consistently stressed <e> <s> it is of paramount importance and the government attach a high priority to the safety of offshore workers <e> <s> safety standards will not be compromised for any reason <e> <s> we constantly seek ways to improve the safety of all offshore workers <e> <s> the government cannot be responsible for the amounts of money about which the noble lord asked me <e> <s> it is for the companies themselves to invest that money but they are encouraged at all turns by the government to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that those matters are the subject of another question but many of the points raised by the noble lord will be taken into account by the report of the noble lord lord cullen <e> <s> that report which deals with a great number of safety matters will be available later in the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the figures which my noble friend seeks <e> <s> it is a question of the part of the north sea in which the investment is made but i understand that the gas-oil split is about per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the uks visible trade surplus in oil was - billion in and the oil trade surplus is forecast to rise to billion in <e> <s> it is the responsibility of my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer as to how that money is spent <e> <s> i do not think that i could agree with the noble lords comment about it being dissipated <e>", "<cs> my lords on this occasion the noble lords question is outside the scope of the question which deals with the north sea <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that onshore investment is mostly in scotland <e> <s> offshore employment remains at the very high level of over <e>", "<cs> my lords i probably have to defer to my noble friends superior knowledge about that matter <e> <s> however i know that the cullen inquiry was set up after the piper alpha disaster to look very carefully at all the safety standards which should be applied offshore <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord hacking for raising this important matter of the proper duration of patent protection to be afforded to new pharmaceutical innovations <e> <s> i have listened with interest to the learned and very germane views that have been put forward on it today <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to that request is no <e> <s> i have outlined the position in which the government find themselves <e> <s> the consultation period is taking place at present <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot go further in informing the noble lord or the house as to when that period will be completed or what the next step will be <e>", "<cs> i recognise the purpose of the noble lord lord underbill in bringing forward this amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord ferrers pointed out to noble lords during the second reading debate that there are different systems of proportional representation <e> <s> indeed different systems or systems with variations are used by several member states within the european community <e> <s> for some time the european parliament has been pressing for the introduction of a uniform electoral procedure for its members throughout the community <e> <s> however no consensus has so far been reached <e> <s> therefore it would be premature to seek to devise a system of proportional representation for great britain in advance of a consensus <e>", "<cs> i note the amendments being moved by my noble friend lord lucas but i should like to remind the committee of what i said on second reading as the governments view has not changed since then <e> <s> i would say in answer to the question of my noble friend that the government intend to put proposals before parliament as soon as time permits to make it more difficult for unscrupulous motor traders to escape conviction where they knowingly sell unroadworthy cars which are likely to find their way onto the road in that condition <e> <s> but statutory defences under the criminal law need to be drafted and considered with great care <e> <s> that is not necessarily to say that the bill is defective in that respect or that the amendment of my noble friend is not welcome but i believe that it is preferable for this matter to be dealt with in a government bill prepared by the parliamentary draftsmen <e>", "<cs> i went a little further on second reading <e> <s> i can inform the committee and the noble lord that we anticipate that this matter will be dealt with in a road safety bill which is due to come before the chamber <e> <s> however as the noble lord quite rightly said i do not wish to anticipate the contents of the queens speech in the autumn <e>", "<cs> i note that the noble lord lord ezra in moving this amendment to his bill is responding to the criticism which i and other noble lords made at second reading about the scope and imprecision of clause <e> <s> i note that he now proposes that the regulation-making powers of the clause should be restricted to the question of car mileages <e> <s> however this still leaves all the difficulties which were discussed at some length at second reading <e> <s> there is a number of fundamental outstanding questions for example how mileage records would be verified what demand there would be for such information and how the service would be funded <e>", "<cs> again the noble lord lord ezra appears to be proposing the establishement of a complex expensive and bureaucratic system that would be of doubtful value in practice <e> <s> there is no reliable evidence that vehicles repaired after serious damage represent any significant threat to road safety <e> <s> therefore the government note the noble lords proposal but do not believe that it would make any tangible contribution to road safety <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that these amendments are necessary to make the bill technically correct <e> <s> therefore i agree the amendments <e> <s> i shall also undertake to pass the comments that were made by the noble lord lord bonham-carter about the act to the right quarters and hope that that matter can be put right <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by congratulating the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs on her sponsorship of this bill <e> <s> this government are committed to the consumer interest and we therefore welcome a measure which will both clarify and strengthen consumers rights <e> <s> the bill has the full support of the government but some minor tidying amendments will be needed as a consequence of the changes made in another place <e> <s> if this house grants the bill a second reading the government will table the appropriate amendments in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall turn to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that the ncc has undertaken a review <e> <s> the dti is undertaking its own review <e> <s> i cannot indicate to the noble lord when that review will be complete <e> <s> it is useful now that the bill has arrived and further consideration will take place soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that to date bnfl has secured contracts for thorp for the reprocessing of spent fuel containing tonnes of uranium <e> <s> those contracts are worth over billion and thorp will be a major export earner for the uk <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> one-third of the baseload capacity for thorp is committed to reprocessing spent fuel from uk reactors <e> <s> in addition bnfl is currently discussing with nuclear electric and scottish nuclear new reprocessing contracts for uk spent fuel covering the post baseload period from onwards <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am happy to confirm that all reprocessing contracts agreed since contain options for the return of waste <e> <s> it is our intention that those options will be exercised and waste returned <e>", "<cs> my lords i wrote to the noble lord following our last exchange <e> <s> i reiterate what i said then <e> <s> the contracts that bnfl has already secured for thorp will ensure that over the baseload period by which i mean the years after completion in the capital costs will be recovered and the plant will make a profit <e> <s> the eventual return on thorp will depend on the level of future business that is secured <e> <s> bnfl is in the process of securing that business now <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is quite correct <e> <s> bnfl has recently secured a contract for the reprocessing of a further tonnes of fuel from the federal republic from onwards <e> <s> bnfl is also confident of signing additional contracts with the germans over the next few weeks bringing the total value to million <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be impossible to arrive at that figure <e> <s> the costs of constructing the plant are well known billion <e> <s> i have told the noble lord that contracts have been signed for billion worth of reprocessing <e> <s> i cannot go further <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that thorp will be run at a profit <e>", "<cs> my lords reprocessing is a proven and safe technology that keeps open the possibility of recycling uranium and plutonium <e> <s> it puts the wastes into a better form for storage and ultimate disposal and avoids leaving spent fuel as a problem to be tackled by future generations <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i hope i have indicated that that is indeed what will happen <e> <s> as i said in my original answer thorp will be a major export earner for the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that noble lords will consider that i take the subject seriously as does bnfl <e> <s> it would not construct a plant to do what it considers is required with the waste unless it also considered it to be very important <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the health of the people working at the sellafield plant is considered carefully <e> <s> bnfl the sellafield workforce and associated trade unions work closely together to try to reduce radiation doses wherever possible <e> <s> over the -year period to the end of last year the average dose for the sellafield workforce was reduced from millisieverts to millisieverts which is a long way below any recommended level <e>", "<cs> my lords it is correct to say that the german plant has not gone into production <e> <s> but it would be wrong to say that a profit will be made out of exposing workers at sellafield to leukaemia because of that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are committed to the liberalisation of air transport <e> <s> we seek to conclude liberal bilateral agreements with individual countries wherever possible <e> <s> within the european community the government have taken a leading role in progress towards a single market in aviation <e> <s> a first package of liberalising measures was agreed by ec transport ministers in and agreement is due to be reached on a second package of measures by the end of june this year <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the council of ministers agreed in principle on the key ingredients of the single market in aviation <e> <s> those ingredients were the introduction of the double disapproval system for setting fares the abolition of bilateral capacity sharing by st january and the introduction of community-wide licensing criteria by st july <e> <s> the second stage due to be agreed by the end of june will essentially build on the first package of measures agreed in <e> <s> it will provide for interim agreements which will operate until the completion of the internal market which was discussed at that meeting <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i should be happy to agree with everything that the noble lord has said which is a nice opportunity for me <e> <s> however i must also point out that liberalisation will afford airlines greater freedom to exercise their own commercial judgments concerning the setting of fares and the type of service provided <e> <s> it is expected that the second package will further relax restrictions on market access and the approval of fares <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly intend to support english estates in promoting the provision of industrial and commercial premises <e> <s> the governments policy is to ensure that premises and sites are available to meet the needs of businesses in the assisted areas <e> <s> wherever possible that should be done through private sector provision <e> <s> english estates will continue to make an important contribution to regional policy but the government now want it to move away from direct provision wherever possible and in many areas to operate primarily as a facilitator using a range of mechanisms to draw in private sector developers <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i agree with almost everything that the noble lord has said <e> <s> the government will continue to support provision of new floor space in assisted areas both through the range of incentives as i have indicated and where incentives do not prove

entirely different question <e> <s> english industrial estates deals with england <e> <s> scotland is a different region <e> <s> however perhaps i may indicate to the noble lord that where the shipyards have closed down in sunderland special provision has been made by english industrial estates to redevelop certain areas there in order to assist with employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am answering for the government but from the department of trade and industry <e> <s> english industrial estates encourages private sector developers into the assisted areas and provides a tremendous amount of market information <e> <s> such information would include available development sites demand rental levels construction costs and rental and capital value growth indices <e>", "<cs> my lords

cent <e> <s> stake in a domestic satellite service uhf television including regional channel or national radio licences <e> <s> that limit will be reciprocal <e> <s> the bill also leaves open the possibility of limiting the number of non-domestic satellite licences which any one group could control <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that <e> <s> a non-domestic satellite service may be owned by

present bill goes much further <e> <s> in clause it sets out the subtitling arrangements which must be included by the licensee whereas the other provision was an encouragement to provide services for

franchise area would need first refusal <e> <s> if the cable franchisee does not take up that opportunity of providing the cabling and the aerials then a licence would be granted <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to disappoint the noble lord but i cannot accept this amendment which would apply the european programming requirement to nondomestic satellite service licences <e> <s> we have made clear that we shall impose the consumer protection requirements on such licences but that otherwise their development should be left to the market <e> <s> i believe that it would be heavy handed to apply a

scargill has made an interesting contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord suggested that government assistance has been restricted <e> <s> all i can say is that in the past government assistance has not been restricted <e> <s> i quoted some interesting figures to the house <e> <s> the noble lord shakes his head and says that that is not the question <e> <s> the figures indicate that the government have not shrunk from assisting the coal industry <e> <s> as i indicated earlier to date most of the imports of coal have been of special coals <e> <s> i agree that the government have no policy to restrict imports of coal <e> <s> it must be up to the generators to decide where to purchase their coal <e> <s> i do not believe that the taxpayer can go on subsidising british coal at everybodys expense indefinitely <e>", "<cs> my lords i have dealt with the fact that some of the coking coal cannot be produced economically in this country <e> <s> we cannot just go on producing coal at the pithead for the industry at any price <e> <s> it leaves us uncompetitive <e> <s> i have dealt with the security of supply that is one of the reasons that we are concentrating on building a nuclear power station <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply first to my noble friend lord morris <e> <s> i did not want him to think that i had misled him or the committee into thinking that bsb owns its own satellite <e> <s> i was referring to the transmission of signals to the satellite that bsb uses rather than to bsbs satellite <e>", "<cs> no it does not <e> <s> it stopped one amendment short in that headlong rush <e>", "<cs> my noble friends amendment touches on a complex area of the bill and it may be helpful if i were to sketch in the background <e>", "<cs> i must agree with the noble

reflects the supply and demand in the world situation <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that it is a restricted market but as i sought to say in my first answer that was investigated by the

two where there was a restriction on supply <e> <s> this has not been a concerted effort to restrict supply <e> <s> therefore it is different from the first two situations <e> <s> certainly we need to look at every other way including energy efficiency to cut down on demand <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the way in which it is traded and as the pound has strengthened it has reduced the prices at the

think that the report from which the noble lord quoted uses the statistics in a way to highlight what it intends to highlight <e> <s> the best yardstick of the general state of compliance is the

vat deregistrations <e> <s> as for cammell laird it is sad that a shipbuilding firm such as that has found itself in difficulties but that reflects the nature of the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a long way from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i have drawn attention to the increase in productivity of manufacturing industry and to the fact that without an increase in productivity we shall never be able to compete <e>", "<cs> my lords no i cannot answer for the cbi but i can answer for the government <e> <s> the future prospects for inflation and jobs are good <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the intention that the industrial tribunals should hear per cent <e> <s> of cases within weeks <e> <s> there has been an increase in the number of cases coming before the tribunals and public expenditure must be contained within the resources available <e> <s> all parts of the public service including industrial tribunals have a part to play in that process <e> <s> i have today announced an increase in the budget for industrial tribunals <e> <s> i am glad to say that the average waiting time in the employment appeal tribunal has fallen from some months in april to an average of months as of todays date <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little confused <e> <s> the noble lord refers to an appeal <e> <s> i do not know whether he means an application to an industrial tribunal <e> <s> the weeks are not wasted <e> <s> it is quite complicated to get all the facts together and prepare the papers <e> <s> he will also be aware that some two-thirds of registered applications do not reach a hearing <e> <s> parties often settle prior to a hearing often through the help of acas <e> <s> therefore the -week period is logical <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the duty of the industrial tribunal to look into the circumstances surrounding the case and to come to some adjudication on whether or not compensation should be paid at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have tried to indicate that this pressure on the budget is caused by an increasing number of cases being referred to industrial tribunals <e> <s> in order to remain within the budget one way of limiting the amount of public expenditure has been to restrict the working of some part-time chairmen <e> <s> i hope that the increase in the budget that i have announced will allow the part-time chairmen to resume their hearings but that will be at the discretion of the president of the industrial tribunals <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a rather different question <e> <s> i am not aware that there are complaints about that <e>", "<cs> my lords the government remain committed to the principle of industrial tribunals as a means of resolving disputes in the workplace <e> <s> they are intended as a speedy inexpensive and informal way of resolving disputes <e>", "<cs> my lords the lay membership of the industrial tribunal panel is quite extensive <e> <s> the regular chairmen are sitting as before <e> <s> the restriction applies only to the number of sittings of part-time chairmen <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that it is a record number of jobs <e> <s> the figure is over more than in march when the upward trend began and nearly million more than during the previous peak in <e> <s> we shall endeavour to ensure that the figure continues to rise as a result of our training programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords there were people involved in manufacturing in june <e> <s> in the service industry there were employed at the same time <e> <s> that figure was up by over million on the previous year <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the number of part-time jobs involved but part-time jobs are included in the figures that i gave <e> <s> the number of part-time jobs has been increasing at a great rate but that is not to say that people who take part-time employment do not seek to do so <e> <s> for them it is a job which they prefer to not having a job at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the figure with me <e> <s> i shall have to find out and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords figures have been given in answers to other questions that the number of registrations for vat has far exceeded the number of deregistrations <e> <s> that is the measure by which the success of small businesses is measured <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i have to agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the figures that i have given indicate that the number of jobs in manufacturing has decreased i have to agree with that <e> <s> however one should bear in mind that some jobs in the manufacturing industry in were not productive at all <e> <s> a great many of the manufacturing industries were losing large amounts of money and there was a great loss of jobs when the labour market was shaken out in the next few years <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for his intervention <e> <s> it is quite clear that the economy is in better shape to take off when inflation falls <e> <s> the most important factor is to get inflation down <e> <s> the government are taking stringent steps to ensure that that happens <e>", "<cs> my lords if manufacturing output dropped between and the situation was worse then than it is now <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is quite correct but a record number of jobs has been made available since that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that needs a reply <e>", "<cs> my lords in the six months to october total unemployment in the united <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honour-able friend the chancellor of the exchequer has agreed that a slowdown is occurring in the economy <e> <s> that is feeding through to unemployment it is obviously sad for those people who lose their jobs <e> <s> however it is important to understand that the unemployment rate in the united kingdom is very much lower than the ec average indeed it is lower than every country in the ec except luxembourg and portugal <e>", "<cs> my lords the confederation expresses one view to which the government certainly pay attention <e> <s> however there are government achievements in the reduction of unemployment <e> <s> long-term unemployment which is one of the most important measures has now dropped to the lowest level since the claimant count began in october <e> <s> the figure is nearly lower than it was in april <e> <s> a fall of nearly has been recorded in the past two years <e> <s> that is a major achievement <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdoms jobs growth record is very impressive <e> <s> the workforce in employment has been rising for over seven years <e> <s> the latest comparable data shows that the rate of growth in employment has been greater than that of our major european partners and also of japan <e> <s> i can confirm that the uk proportion of the population of working age in employment of per cent <e> <s> is much higher than the ec average of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to say that one should not believe everything that one reads <e> <s> however i am now at pains to know how to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously the noble lord feels rather passionately about the matter <e>", "<cs> the figures have not been fiddled <e> <s> they show those who are unemployed and who are actively seeking work <e> <s> i should add that over one-third of a million unemployed leave the count every month over one quarter of those who become unemployed leave within the first month and per cent <e> <s> leave within the first three months <e>", "<cs> my lords the pressure on the economy is putting pressure on margins <e> <s> if further pressure is put on them by an increase in wages i am afraid that unemployment will occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i answered that question to a certain extent <e> <s> i said that about one-third of a million of unemployed people leave the count each month <e> <s> this would indicate that because the unemployment figures do not increase by that amount each month many people are moving in and out of employment <e> <s> as one would expect in a vibrant economy people leave jobs and obtain other jobs just as quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords that is indeed a reflection of the current situation <e> <s> a slowdown is taking place in the economy which is now reflected in the number of unemployed <e> <s> however as i said in answer to a previous question the economy is in good shape and when inflation drops the number of jobs will rapidly increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that that was purely speculation <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered the last part of that question when replying to a previous question <e> <s> the figures need to be put into perspective <e> <s> i mentioned that there were long-term unemployed <e> <s> there are difficulties in obtaining work when one has been unemployed for over a year <e> <s> the work done by the department of employment with its training programmes which have reduced the number of long-term unemployed from the figure that i gave to has been a success <e>", "<cs> my lords the alteration in training budget direction of spend is merited by the figures for the drop in the number of long-term unemployed that i have just given <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at the figure for youth training he will see that that has increased by million and that is just as important <e>"]
