["<cs> my lords i ask indulgence for someone who addresses this honourable house for the first time <e> <s> the subject that we are discussing does not readily lend itself to a non-controversial speech and i fear that my own temperament is not much help to me in that direction either <e> <s> but i will begin by saying that i do indeed agree with the noble lord lord thorneycroft that the nation now faces on a remarkable scale both opportunities and dangers though i hope without offence to venture to suggest a little later that i think that with regard to some of them the governments approach is not quite right <e> <s> i agree also with what has been said on both sides of the house about the importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i join most readily in the congratulations that have been offered by those who spoke earlier to the noble lord the foreign secretary <e> <s> as we have studied the progress at lancaster house i think that we have all admired the skill and patience that he has shown <e> <s> we should also pay tribute to what all parties at that conference have done including what the front-line presidents have done in the way of being ready to make concessions and to allow the conference to proceed <e> <s> so far so good <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister would explain this to me if it is so important to restrict borrowing why are banks always putting out advertisements urging us by means of access cards and other devices to buy things we cannot afford with money we have not yet got <e> <s> is there not something to be said for distinguishing between borrowing to increase personal consumption and borrowing to help the productive process <e>", "<cs> i want to say a few words about clause because it seems that quite apart from the rhodesian issue it is a matter of such constitutional importance <e> <s> without this clause ian smith and some of his associates would be in danger of prosecution for treason and murder <e> <s> this clause is exempting them from that <e> <s> it is the use of the legislative power to override the ordinary rule of law <e> <s> for my part i believe that it is sensible and right to have the clause in the bill and i think that most of my noble friends would agree with me <e>", "<cs> my lords the foreign secretary mentioned the importance of worldwide representation <e> <s> can he assure us that it is still worldwide and that his governmental colleagues particularly in the treasury have not been getting at him to reduce it <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm or deny the rumour that the government had <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a recognised duty for anyone who speaks in this house after a maiden speaker to congratulate the noble lord who has made it <e> <s> but for me having the good fortune to congratulate the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord noticed that some of those reports recently appearing in the media suggest very strongly that several of these acts of terrorism have been carried out by those who are called auxiliaries or members of the security forces and that they seem to be intended either to injure the supporters of mr mugabe or to discredit him <e> <s> can the noble lord comment on that aspect of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a lengthy and impressive debate <e> <s> i am still a novice in this house but i would hazard a guess that there has rarely been a debate in which out of all the speeches there has been so small a proportion of support for the government <e> <s> the noble baroness lady young said at the outset she was very glad that the noble lord lord butler of saffron walden was to take part <e> <s> so were we all though whether she was equally glad when he had finished his speech we are entitled to wonder <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear she was pleased <e> <s> in that case i hope she will listen to and follow the advice which he gave but i am afraid i am also at liberty to wonder whether that can happen <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i am almost inclined to say against my wishes that i am glad there will not be a division so as not to put the noble lord in that equivocal position <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord noticed that recently there have been parliamentary elections in the soviet union <e> <s> does it not look as if my noble friend lord paget has somehow missed his vocation and got into the wrong legislature <e>", "<cs> with respect to the minister i do not think she has so far made a convincing case against the amendment <e> <s> if we look first at the immediate issue it can be defined in this way as things now stand the secretary of state has to approve the articles of government for secondary schools but will not have to approve the articles of government as they will now be called for primary schools <e> <s> why is that distinction being made <e> <s> the minister pointed out that throughout the bill there runs the question how much freedom should he given to local authorities and what matters should come <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i agree that we shall have an opportunity for fuller discussion on the duties of governors on the later amendments <e> <s> at this stage i am only making a few preliminary remarks <e> <s> it seems to arise on this clause because the articles of government will presumably give some idea about the duties of governors <e> <s> the government are standing by the proposition that where a secondary school is concerned this formulation of the duties of governors is a matter that the secretary of state ought to have under review whereas for primary schools the secretary of state apparently is not interested <e> <s> that raises the question how important are the articles of government and how important is it to get some idea of what governors do <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble lord opposite and to my noble friend lady phillips <e> <s> weighing everything up i do not wish to press this amendment <e>", "<cs> i found that it was rather difficult to follow some of the arguments advanced against this amendment <e> <s> it does not say or even suggest that the governors have got to be members of the local education authority <e> <s> if i understood the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill aright he argued that if this amendment were carried nobody would want to be a governor unless he were a member of the local education authority <e> <s> if that was not what the noble lord meant he was certainly arguing that the result of this amendment would be that people would have to be governors of large numbers of schools <e> <s> there is not the slightest necessity for that <e> <s> the local education authority can choose people to be governors of schools without loading on to each one of them that they must be governors of more than one school and experience shows that that is so <e>", "<cs> well i defer to my noble friend but i think he will agree that it was a near thing <e> <s> however i believe that the responsibility lies with the local authority and that its representatives therefore ought not to be outnumbered <e> <s> that is really what we are discussing in this amendment and we ought not to be put off by the suggestion that it is a necessary part of this amendment that one man or one woman should be a governor of schools <e> <s> there is not the least necessity for that it is a complete red herring <e> <s> therefore i invite the committee to consider what is really involved in this amendment the real principle of democracy and the fact that the local authority who in the end will have to carry the can should not be outnumbered on the governing body <e>", "<cs> after listening to the noble lord lord james i do suggest that there is a large educational world beyond his experience perhaps a less happy educational world than the one he knows <e> <s> we all know that headmasters can have a considerable influence <e> <s> i remember once going to a meeting in the palace of westminster which was to be addressed by the headmaster of eton <e> <s> for some reason most of the people coming were a little late and it was very interesting to notice how even in late middle age they were scurrying along the corridor at the thought of being late for a meeting addressed by a headmaster <e> <s> in many state schools it really is not quite like that and it is no good our discussing whether it ought to be <e> <s> the governors particularly when you go to all this trouble to appoint them expect to have some influence about how the school is run <e>", "<cs> i hope that i may be forgiven for not quite understanding that the noble lord was supporting me <e> <s> however as it is the wish of my noble friends to press this amendment to a vote we shall see for certain <e>", "<cs> the government arc being implored in all quarters of the committee to accept the amendment and i really feel they should <e> <s> on the question of enforceability my noble friend lady wootton of abinger pointed out that it has been considered for a long time to he useful to put what i would call clauses of exhortation into a bill they are a reminder <e> <s> it might happen that a local authority behaved in a slovenly fashion over its appointment of governors and paid no attention to the kind of thing mentioned in this proposal <e> <s> if on the other hand the amendment were in the bill the secretary of state would then have a solid ground on which to tell them to think again <e> <s> without this provision he could not do that and it is a well-known principle of law that if there is in a statute something which advises against a particular abuse it is likely to raise the general standard of behaviour <e> <s> not many local authorities would ignore all these things but the fact that if one of them did the secretary of state could act would i think act as a general stimulus to them <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord has referred to me so definitely i think that i should reply <e> <s> i have indeed long experience of debating with him and it has taught me that he is almost invariably wrong as indeed he is in this instance <e> <s> one of the grumbles from the government about our amendment is that it is too prescriptive though the noble baroness admitted that prescribe is too strong a word <e> <s> but amendments nos <e> <s> and are rather more prescriptive they would arouse greater hostility from the government <e> <s> when the noble lord speaks of our wasting our vote on this amendment does he imagine that we come here with only a certain number of votes available <e> <s> if the noble lord really prefers amendments nos <e> <s> and i trust that if we are defeated and noble lords on the liberal benches press their proposal to a vote we shall then see the noble lord putting his feet where his mouth is <e>", "<cs> i follow a great deal of the ministers remarks but i am puzzled about one matter <e> <s> i can see the secretary of state approving the instrument of government but i cannot see him scrutinising the list of governors in each school and being aware that the child of one of them had left that school six or months earlier <e> <s> will it be possible for the secretary of state by his own action to determine that a governor does not go on being a governor long after his child has left the school <e> <s> the minister asks my noble friend lady david not to press the amendment on the ground that the secretary of state will take care of the <e>", "<cs> i am greatly obliged to the noble baroness and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble baroness <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i want to say only a few words <e> <s> there is always the possibility that the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls may arrive while i am saying them <e> <s> the government are being most tiresome and really pernickety about this <e> <s> lord bellwins first objection to amendment no <e> <s> was that it was defective <e> <s> apparently it was defective because the words and in it were unnecessary <e> <s> being equally pernickety myself i should have thought that made it excessive rather than defective <e> <s> it certainly was not defective in the legal sense because the presence of those unnecessary words would not have invalidated the effect of the rest of the amendment <e> <s> that has been the level of the governments comment <e> <s> but on the serious issue surely the position is this <e>", "<cs> the committee will hardly be surprised if i say that i agree with my noble friend lady stewart of alvechurch <e> <s> i have been doing so for some time <e> <s> may i first refer to the points raised by the noble baroness <e> <s> the amendment would leave it for the pupils themselves to decide which pupils would be chosen and of course they could not compel a pupil who said i am too busy <e> <s> i have my work to do <e> <s> i think you would find that the pupils chosen would be those who could take it on and i think they would do it well <e>", "<cs> i must reply to that <e> <s> in the various educational experiences i have had i have never been a headmaster and the difficulty i have had with headmasters all my life is to get them to listen to what one is actually saying <e> <s> the point i was arguing was this i thought it was plain enough <e> <s> the old public school prefectorial system was designed to support an imperialist aristocratic society and in that context it did what it was intended to do <e> <s> i am pointing out that today we do not live in that kind of society but we have the same problem of getting the co-operation of young people in making the kind of society we live in work well <e>", "<cs> can the noble baroness give me an indication of how long it will take and would it be fair to assume that within a year of the passage of the act this provision would apply to all schools <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble baroness <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness made a criticism of the drafting of the amendment <e> <s> i must say that the government are very hard to <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the government are going to ask for raw exam results <e> <s> all i am saying is that if they do that then they ought to do this as well <e>", "<cs> from the reply she has given it is quite clear that in some form or other the noble baroness wants the examination results published and also she is quite definite that she does not want the information mentioned in this amendment published <e>", "<cs> that makes the refusal of the noble baroness all the more remarkable <e> <s> it means that schools are to publish information by virtue of which they might be judged without the very important qualification that the public ought to know before they can reach a decision <e> <s> we are told in fact that the parents would not be bright enough to understand this information <e> <s> if that is the attitude that is going to be taken why publish information at all <e> <s> exactly the same objection can be raised to the publication of examination results <e> <s> if as the noble baroness alleges this information is already available then it ought to be included in what she is going to require <e> <s> to require them to publish their examination results and not to require them to say whether they are spending more per child in one kind of school than in another is a fraud <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady young has raised objection to this amendment on the ground that it puts two conflicting sets of duties on local authorities those under this legislation and those under the act <e> <s> surely it would be easy to include in the repeals schedule of the bill repeal of the relevant sections of the act <e> <s> the conflict between the two sets of duties would then be resolved <e>", "<cs> we have not moved the amendments that we had in mind for this clause but there are one or two matters that i should like to raise and i hope that the government will bear them in mind and perhaps be able to do something about them at the report stage <e>", "<cs> i believe that the minister was suggesting to us that since clause requires the secretary of states approval for the closing of nursery schools he was conferring on nursery education a great benefit <e>", "<cs> a great advance that it had not had before <e> <s> but this is done in the context of a bill clause of which no longer makes it a duty of local authorities to provide nursery education at all <e> <s> so what has happened is that in clause the government have poured a steady torrent of discouragement on nursery education by making it no longer a duty of local authorities <e> <s> the minister now tells us that in clause the government have provided a modest umbrella against that torrent <e> <s> we are now pointing out to the noble lord that there is a large hole in this umbrella and we are suggesting that that at least might be rectified <e>", "<cs> yes but i have a suspicion that by that time the cost of an average secondary school pupil will be rather higher than and i do not think they will cater for pupils on million <e> <s> so we are in a little of a fog as to quite how many children and how much money will ultimately be involved in this scheme <e>", "<cs> i do not think i was ever very keen on that myself i must say but as the noble lord knows it has always been argued that that was a special case <e> <s> i am myself very doubtful of itbut even if one accepts the principle and accept it unwillingly i do not wish to see it extended <e> <s> i think it is a bad principle <e> <s> as say the noble baroness may be able to assure me that i am all wrong and that they are not going t spend more than <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> should like to deal first with what seems to me the one argument of substance advanced in favour of this scheme which can be put thus there are only a limited number of people who can teach certain subjects chemistry was mentioned particularly but there are other subjects to which it applies and there are only a limited number of people who can teach these subjects really well <e> <s> unless therefore we have an assisted places scheme a number of bright children will fail to get the teaching they need <e>", "<cs> yes i understand that boarding fees are not included but does that mean that a boarding school could not be a participating school <e>", "<cs> i notice that it is not said explicitly in the bill that no boarding schools will participate and that is rather important <e>", "<cs> if boarding schools participate this is just <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has always had a habit of turning what was said into something rather different <e> <s> he makes a very telling reply destroying what he represents as having been said <e> <s> i am not suggesting that they always took little yes-men but i quite certainly say that neither the direct <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the arguments that have been advanced during this debate in favour of the governments clause <e> <s> it seems to me that they can be summarised under three heads with the resounding slogan equity liberty and economy <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has put her finger on the point that i am seeking to make <e> <s> are records of that kind educational within the meaning of the word educational here <e> <s> that is what we want to know <e>", "<cs> i should like to get this clear <e> <s> that means <e>", "<cs> with great respect i think that my noble riend is agreeing with me <e> <s> i am very much concerned and that is why i raised the amendment that these noneducational records to which my noble friend referred should not be bandied about <e> <s> want the safeguard that this clause would imply that the secretary of state can make regulations as to whether or not they should be disclosed <e> <s> the regulations cover the keeping disclosure and transfer of the records <e> <s> if my amendment is accepted the secretary of state would be able to lay it down that confidentiality must be observed about these records <e> <s> if the word educational stays in apparently he could not give any ruling or instruction <e> <s> if a local authority chose to be careless about it there is nothing the secretary of state could do <e> <s> i am more disquieted the more this argument proceeds <e>", "<cs> we are in the odd position that apparently the local authorities are to be trusted completely regarding the confidentiality of non-educational records which may well be of a highly confidential character but apparently are not to be trusted with such information as what marks the child received at the last school examinations <e> <s> it seems very odd that the secretary of state should have power to direct them <e>", "<cs> i should like to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does not seem to have any sense of answering an argument <e> <s> he just reads us a set piece each time <e> <s> i am reminded of the story of an american <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that we would have a more helpful reply from the government on this <e> <s> if i may refer for a moment to the words of the right reverend prelate he argued that what we are suggesting can by implication already be found in clause of the bill <e> <s> however the difference is that clause sets out the kind of people the governors must be it says that some must be drawn from one category and some from another <e> <s> part of the trouble is that in the process of making quite sure that they have a parent governor so many from the local education authority so many from the foundation and so on they may overlook the question what kind of people are they <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is a general point at issue here which crops up not only in relation to this clause but in relation to others as well <e> <s> it is this who are the parties when an appeal is made <e> <s> at the outset it looks as if there is the parent on one side and the local authority on the other but we must remember that the local authority is really representing the interests of children in the neighbourhood as a whole <e> <s> it is not a conflict between an individual parent with a right and what might be pictured as a soulless local authority <e> <s> it is a question of the claim of one parent and the need for all parents to have provided for them the best education which the resources of the district allow <e> <s> i think that has to be remembered in the whole argument about appeals <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall make no apology for delivering what the noble baroness called a lecture on the matter <e> <s> in view of the widespread ignorance of all the issues involved by the opponents of comprehensive and secondary education and the frequent deliberate falsification of history by the advocates of grammar schools it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble baroness <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend lord darwen mentioned a school that dealt with maladjusted children <e> <s> i can well accept that a school facing those difficulties would have to spend more per child than a school with the more usual problems <e> <s> i think that the public as a whole would expect that <e> <s> but is there any reason why the facts should not be made known <e> <s> the reason for it is not difficult to explain or understand <e> <s> the whole point of my argument is that the information ought to be there then people can argue about it and see if there are differences why there are differences and to what extent they are justifiable <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to the arguments which have been advanced on this amendment and i do see the force of some of them the difficulty of preparing plans <e> <s> it might be a valid criticism that i have proposed something too elaborate to deal with the particular problem that i have in mind <e> <s> however some of the other arguments which have been advanced against the amendment do not seem to me to carry conviction <e> <s> the noble earl has just pointed out that if you make a plan of any kind you may have to change it because of altered circumstances <e> <s> but that is true of almost every department of human life <e> <s> it is true of making any decision about what you hope to do next year or the year after <e> <s> if we followed that line of argument it would be impossible to reach any decisions as <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has said that these premises are to be a school <e> <s> can we at least have an assurance that at that school there will be no assisted places under clause of the education bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount lord simon said that he and his colleagues were going to consider the amendments on their merits <e> <s> i would particularly commend this amendment to him because whatever view any of us might hold of the merits of the assisted places scheme it must surely be desirable that we should be properly informed about how it works <e> <s> it may be that some noble lords will be proved right and some proved wrong but it will be difficult to ascertain that unless parliament does know what is happening <e> <s> it is a good general principle when you are spending public money and in the end it is going to be quite a lot of public money that parliament should know whether on any assumptions you are getting value for money <e> <s> moreover the act requires that the assisted places should be equitably distributed both with regard to different regions of the country and with regard to the sex of the pupils <e> <s> what we are asking here is that we shall have an annual report from which we can judge whether these intentions in the act are or are not being fulfilled <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am not altogether reassured by that <e> <s> the noble baroness tells us that we shall find out after the children have been to the school whether the school was all right or not but it would be rather late in the day <e> <s> i would not have pressed <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should amend what i said just now <e> <s> the noble earl seems to be saying that where parents who cannot afford them get an assisted place for a child and there are necessary travelling expenses those expenses could be dealt with and probably would be dealt with under clause <e> <s> we are saddled with <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that the conclusion i would draw about the language of and of is that the conservative government have learnt nothing in years <e>", "<cs> my lords the remarks of my noble friend lord brooks of tremorfa were very much to the point <e> <s> the noble baroness lady young produced the usual argument the local authorities asked for it <e> <s> if you make it quite clear to local authorities first of all that you are hanging them over the head by saying they will have a good deal less money you will probably extract a request of some kind from them <e> <s> the highwayman who says to his victim your money or your life could be fairly said to be giving his victim freedom of choice <e> <s> that is rather the position in which local authorities have been placed so i hope we will not have any more of that it is intellectually beneath the level of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is not almost indelicate to mention such a subject in this house at this hour the noble lords attitude comes dangerously near to a declaration of class war <e> <s> indeed it is a remakable thing in this country today that people who would most bitterly repudiate the doctrines of karl marx seem most anxious to behave in a way which proves he was right <e> <s> they quite brutally oppose the advantages of those who are already fortunate to the needs of those who are really in need and that as we all know behind all these amendments and so on is what we are really talking about <e> <s> i therefore find the arguments of the noble lord against the amendment morally repulsive and the arguments of the noble baroness against it intellectually unsatisfying and i invite my noble friends to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down can she say whether short of regulations she is thinking of issuing any kind of advice or guidance to local authorities about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble baroness for the consideration given to this matter and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it had occurred to me that we had already spoken so much on this bill that possibly this stage might be comparatively brief but as one who has always had an interest in education it is gratifying to find how much new thought has been injected into the debate <e> <s> i am tempted first to make a brief comment on what was said by my noble friend lord shinwell <e> <s> it is not for me to say what the procedures of this house ought to be i have not been here long enough to know that but i think it is true of procedure generally in any legislature that an opposition is entitled if it is deeply suspicious of a bill and dislikes its whole nature to press and harass the bill at almost every point and to move a great many amendments in the hope that some at least will be successful and we have had some little success <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i remember that but i also remember the noble viscount speaking to a conference of the national union of teachers at which he expounded the view that the basic philosophy of comprehensive secondary education was un-christian <e> <s> the fact is that he could not in all cases refuse to let comprehensive secondary education be established for even conservative ministers could not always find a plausible reason if the local authorities wanted it <e> <s> but wherever there was a plausible reason it was used <e> <s> conservative ministers encouraged people to draft and prepare petitions so that they could have the chance of turning down proposals for comprehensive secondary education <e> <s> even the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill caused great agony to the people in leicestershire by telling them that abolishing the -plus was illegal a proposition that i do not think can be properly defended <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what we are wondering <e> <s> we are told that million is to be spent on the assisted places scheme <e> <s> we can start by using the money there <e> <s> i am not quite sure that the noble lord has grasped what is happening <e> <s> it is his spendthrift government that are proposing to spend million on educational snobbery <e> <s> if he is asking where is the money coming from <e> <s> let him talk to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as greece adheres to the community on st january ought not these students to be entitled to pay eec rates at least for two terms out of three in the coming academic year <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble baroness says that it will not be appropriate to deal with the fees on a yearly basis by that does she mean anything more than it has not been done before and that she lacks the imagination and generosity needed to deal with this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a lengthy wide-ranging debate on the many aspects of the bill <e> <s> i do not know whether we can call it an enthusastic debate so far as the bill is concerned <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord who opened and will reply to the debate will have made careful note of all the criticisms and misgivings that not only we on this side but his noble friends have expressed <e> <s> there is one aspect of the matter with which i should like to begin and which has not received a great deal of attention <e> <s> it is this all the things which the bill proposes to do are going to be carried out in a climate of steadily declining house building <e> <s> there is nothing in this bill to deal with the fact that we just do not have a large enough housing stock and the rate at which new houses are being provided is steadily declining <e> <s> that makes the solution of all the problems more difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords do we know whether computers ever go wrong in the soviet union and whether their checking mechanism is reliable <e>", "<cs> my lords while we all appreicate the governments desire to settle this matter by negotiation if at all possible may we have an assurance that it is the governments firm policy that secession from the new hebrides will not be permitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble minister answered the question of the noble lord lord gladwyn as to whether these weapons would ever be used in a first-strike capacity <e> <s> but whatever the answer to that question may be is the noble minister aware that a number of us here believe this measure to be essential to the credibility of nato and hold also that the evidence of the last years is that the credibility of nato is our strongest guarantee of peace <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask two questions <e> <s> the first relates to production of coal <e> <s> am i right in thinking that all the ministers thought it would be a good thing to increase the production of coal <e>", "<cs> my lords secondly am i right in thinking that you would not increase the production of coal by closing down pits <e> <s> is it not also true that if the price of oil rises some of the pits which are now regarded as uneconomic will become economic <e> <s> the other question is about resources <e> <s> if i heard the noble minister correctly the ministers concluded that the resources should be shifted from consumption to investment and from the public to the private sector <e> <s> what do you do if those two criteria happen to point in different directions <e> <s> for example if you save money by closing down a coalmine and use it to make tax concessions to wealthy <e>", "<cs> my lords may we take it that the government are anxious to secure a uniform method and system of election and will do whatever they can to accelerate the process because it is bound to require a good deal of consideration before agreement is reached all round <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord does not feel that he can accept the amendment <e> <s> i think he was a little too pleased with his ingenuity in trying to convict us on this side of the committee of an inconsistency so much so that he did not pay attention to the real nature of the argument <e> <s> let me spell it out <e> <s> i believe that in general it will be the more attractive houses which are bought <e> <s> both common sense and experience suggest that <e> <s> but one should notice that more attractive can sometimes be a subjective judgment <e>", "<cs> i trust that the noble duke is right but the evidence is not yet available <e>", "<cs> that contribution exposes some of the misunderstandings that there are on the other side of the committee about the amendment <e> <s> this amendment does not compel anybody to go on living in a house <e> <s> the noble viscount might address the question to the government what happens if a purchaser dies before the five years that they propose are up <e> <s> neither the clause nor the amendment oblige anybody to go on living in a house <e> <s> the question is this <e> <s> if you are allowed to buy a house which originally was council property on very advantageous terms how soon ought you to be able to sell that house and in effect make a gain out of it <e> <s> that is the point we are arguing <e>", "<cs> may i say in reply to the noble duke that he has raised the question of private estates <e> <s> if a man buys a house privately at the market value it is his business when he sells <e> <s> but if he buys a house which was built at public expense at well below the market value on very favourable terms it is a matter of public concern to ask to what extent ought he to be able to make money out of that transaction <e>", "<cs> the noble duke supports the government not i he will take if he likes his pessimistic view of the future of inflation <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would not be better for us to remove the clause from the bill at this stage and give the government time to think about putting in something a little more appropriate at a later stage <e> <s> already in the course of the discussion on this clause the noble lord lord bellwin has agreed to discuss certain matters with my noble friends on the front bench <e>", "<cs> the interventions that my noble friends have made indicate that there is a great deal of difficulty about this <e> <s> i have again been studying clause to which the noble lord lord bellwin referred me <e> <s> clause deals with the amount of mortgage to which a person is entitled but it does not give an entirely clear answer <e> <s> the amount is set out in subsection <e> <s> then subsection states <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest to what the noble lord lord foot has said <e> <s> like him i have been trying to think whether there is any parallel for this sort of thing <e> <s> i doubt that there is but i do recall an item in the rent act that made it possible for the secretary of state by order to decontrol certain areas <e> <s> of course it is not a very happy precedent <e> <s> the experience of what was called creeping decontrol was so unattractive that after a time the secretary of state had to give an undertaking that there would not be any more for a while at least not until the next general election was over <e> <s> however it was not as drastic a defiance of what is in an act of parliament as is now proposed <e>", "<cs> it is that which worries me <e> <s> i think that the government ought to look at this again <e> <s> they should be able to say to us with confidence what the position is of a tenant who has already entered into a shorthold agreement if this power is used and be able to tell us on what authority they make that pronouncement <e> <s> secondly they ought to put some greater limit on the powers of the secretary of state than there apparently is in the bill as it at present stands <e>", "<cs> will the minister allow me <e> <s> do i understand that there are other notes on clauses that he has not seen which would be elucidatory and not confusing and if there are such notes why has he not seen them <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the minister has said <e> <s> i noticed that all the examples which he gave of the use of this power were of exactly the same kind as in the consultation document issued to the local authority that is to say they apply where there have been transfers of property from one authority to another and the use of this power would be not much more than a bookkeeping arrangement more convenient than leaving the transfer payments to be made <e> <s> we are still left with the fact that the secretary of state is given a very wide power which can be used in circumstances which as the noble lord lord bellwin himself said cannot be foreseen <e> <s> one cannot be entirely happy about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful that so many noble lords have been ready to take part in the debate and to enrich it with speeches based on knowledge and experience drawn from many sources <e> <s> i think that all of us are also grateful for the full and informative statements that we have had from the noble lord the foreign secretary and the noble lord lord trefgarne and we shall want to study them with care <e> <s> my lords with the leave of the house i beg to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government inform mr biggs the train robber who is now in brazil that he can return home safely since the practice of transferring public property to private hands is now regarded as respectable <e>", "<cs> there has been much mention in the argument about the bill both within this house and beyond of extravagance overspending danger to the national economy <e> <s> i think that we all accept that what is extravagant and what is overspending is a matter for legitimate difference of opinion among sensible people <e> <s> expenditure which some citizens will regard as extravagant others will regard as necessary or generous or worthy of the dignity of their borough <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord leaves that point as he is so emphatic about this how does he understand the words in clause which state that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is yet another deplorable example of the governments mismanagement not only of this monster of a bill but of their whole programme that we have to consider at this hour of the night one of the major problems that has faced this country for a good many years and which will face it for some years to come <e> <s> consequently like my noble friend lord mishcon i shall not attempt to test the opinion of the committee at this hour nor indeed to deploy in full the argument about it <e> <s> i hope we may be able to return to that at a later stage <e> <s> for the present i shall say only that the repeal of the community land act would mean losing an opportunity for solving a long-standing problem that may be briefly described as follows how to prevent gross profiteering in land values without at the same time drying up the supply of land coming forward for development <e>", "<cs> but we have already been told in a sort of aside by one member of the government front bench this evening that the development land tax is being reconsidered <e>", "<cs> i have listened with horror to the story my noble friend lady denington has told us <e> <s> it gives a meaning that some of us had not <e>", "<cs> my lords granted that the boundary commissions are independent statutory bodies if the government can properly tell magistrates courts to be realistic in sentencing policy is there anything really inappropriate in their telling the boundary commissions to hurry up <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned that at some future date there might be legislation about allotments <e> <s> he suggested that the points that we have been discussing here would be better dealt with when that time came whenever it might be <e> <s> he added that there will be consultation with the local authority associations <e> <s> i hope that there will also be consultation with those up and down the country who have allotments <e> <s> we sometimes assume too readily that if central government relaxes control and puts more power in the hands of local government this is bound to result in more democracy and responsiveness to the needs of people <e> <s> that will not always be <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers reference to nato may i ask him to assure us that it is the governments policy to continue to fulfil the pledge about the increase of our defences that was made to that organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept the comparison which the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill draws with the reference to religious education in the act <e> <s> after all the essence of that mention of religious education was to oblige schools to have religious education <e> <s> it was <e>", "<cs> my lords this is indeed a momentous occasion <e> <s> the government are proposing to increase public expenditure and what is even more remarkable they are proposing to increase it on education and they have found a new way of doing so because these regulations are a method by which a new channel of transferring public money to private persons may be opened <e> <s> this is contrary to the governments general approach <e> <s> every day when we open the papers we learn of the state of play inside the cabinet and exactly which social services are to be hardest hit in addition to the cuts which have been imposed already <e> <s> we must therefore presume that with these regulations which provide for increased public expenditure through a new channel we are dealing with something that is absolutely essential to the national survival because i am sure the noble baroness would not have proposed anything so irresponsible as an increase in public expenditure unless she was sure that the nations survival depended upon the speedy introduction of the assisted places scheme <e> <s> i am afraid there are some of my noble friends who might not share that view who might consider that to come forward with this proposal which we are told is going to run up to over million in the end in the present situation of cuts and economy is little short of grotesque <e>", "<cs> my lords may we take it that the governments general policy of not more than per cent <e> <s> in the public sector will apply in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly begin by saying that we are glad to see the foreign secretary with us again <e> <s> it would not be fair on my part to say that i wish he had been with us during the long nights of the summer <e> <s> i do not believe that any human being ought to be asked to sustain both the burden of being foreign secretary and the burden of detailed legislation in the house <e> <s> there is a limit to human endurance <e> <s> we are glad to see the noble lord again and everyone has listened with great interest to the important survey that he has given of the issues before the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i remember one of the last tasks that i performed as foreign secretary was to visit turkey in the aftermath of a great earthquake and one is moved by the courage with which people in these dreadful circumstances set to work to pick up their lives again <e> <s> i think we can say with confidence that we know the government will do whatever is appropriate and is in their power to help the victims of this terrible tragedy <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the first step to undoing the muddle created by a previous conservative government is welcome <e> <s> may we hope that it will be followed by an attempt to dismantle the rest of their national health service act the local government act and the london government act <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been some public speculation about the future size of british forces in germany <e> <s> i do not think that the statement mentioned that point in particular <e> <s> can the noble viscount tell us something about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin as other speakers have done by expressing our sympathy with the noble baroness lady young and i regret that she could not have been with us during this debate <e> <s> secondly i should like to express my warmest congratulations to the noble lord lord swann on his maiden speech to which we all listened with great delight and entertainment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen public houses going up <e> <s> but it is the business of a civilised society to see whether it is provided by public or private enterprise that the provision made for education shows that we respect education as much as we respect a restaurant or a public house <e> <s> the point i am trying to make is that we are not doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords any buildings of course <e> <s> some schools at one time were luxury buildings <e> <s> any kind of building can be either luxury or it can be down-at-heel <e> <s> what i am saying is that one can find plenty of luxury buildings in the private sector whereas schools are continually allowed to become down-at-heel and i do not believe that is a desirable thing <e> <s> if the noble baroness lady trumpington thinks that it is not happening she had better have another look at the hmi report and i noticed that although she was prepared to accept stoically that schools could go short of books she felt it to be an absolute necessity that she should have a copy of the inspectors report the moment she wanted it <e> <s> now that she has got it i hope she will study it <e>", "<cs> my lords it seemed to me that in his impartial speech the one sentence that was critical of the government was thrust in in so apologetic a manner that it was very difficult for the rest of us to hear what exactly he said <e> <s> i thought the noble lord was criticising the government for what they were doing to the universities <e> <s> if i was wrong i will withdraw <e>", "<cs> i will certainly read it my lords but i am bound to say that it seemed to me at the time that it did not take quite so long as the noble lord has just taken <e>", "<cs> my lords we then got from the noble lord lord annan an extremely impressive formidable and alarming exposition of the situation that the universities in fact face <e> <s> what was perhaps most alarming about it was this <e> <s> it looks as though the government have rushed into the proposition of a per cent <e> <s> reduction on universities without any serious consideration in advance of what the problems involved will be <e> <s> that came out i think in the speeches of the noble lord lord annan the noble lord lord flowers and my noble friend lord longford <e> <s> i do not suppose that in the time available tonight the noble lord lord belstead and after all it is not his department will be able to expound very greatly on this but it seems to me that the government must pay very great attention to what has been said in this debate about the cuts on universities <e> <s> after all the remarks come from very well-informed sources which are not prejudiced against the government and they deal with something that is absolutely vital to the educational structure and to our national life and our nations chances of recovery <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that in capital cities there are a number of specialised problems people coming in for employment students and people from overseas and these affect some of the london boroughs much more than others and consequently they cannot be dealt with solely on a borough basis <e> <s> this was the whole point of having a housing authority in the capital city other than in the boroughs <e> <s> if that is too remote an authority that was simply because the herbert commission created this monstrous glc instead of the london county council which was doing the job very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i think everyone will agree that this has been a debate of great interest and we are greatly indebted to my noble friend lord longford for introducing it <e> <s> the kind of subjects which legislatures have to discuss today are as a rule so full of detail and technicality that we often find we do not have time to look back and ask what kind of society are we creating in what directions ought we to be moving <e> <s> it is particularly valuable therefore to have a debate of this sort and it is this house rather than the other which has the time to do that kind of thing <e> <s> as was wittily said this is indeed a house of peers so let nobody be jocular at the expense of the idea of the lords debating equality <e>", "<cs> my lords if postmen had been supplied the magazine might be still in existence <e> <s> one cannot be at all sure that there is anything just or sensible about it <e> <s> in a society where there are gross inequalities many of which i do not say all of them are totally unjustifiable upon any rational principle it is no good trying to persuade people who work for their living to accept restraint and to have regard for the public interest <e> <s> we live in a society in which people want to get more <e> <s> that perhaps is a common and an unavoidable human weakness <e> <s> but one result of our positive worship of inequality is that people not only want to have more for their own enjoyment but regard it as a virtue in itself to have more than the other fellow the evil which the greeks called pleiomexia the itch for having some more <e> <s> it is that which over the years has made incomes policies fail <e> <s> some people conclude from that that one ought not even to try <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all agreed that we are very much indebted to my noble friend lady birk for initiating this debate and for the <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it is in order for me to say on behalf of my noble friend lady birk that i beg leave to withdraw the motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to my noble friend lord greenhill of harrow for initiating this debate and for providing us with the report that we have been discussing <e> <s> i think and hope that he will feel rewarded by the fact that there has been a well-informed and interesting debate <e> <s> it has been enlivened by two maiden speeches from my noble friends lord molloy and lord bishopston and it was a pleasure to me personally to meet them again in this house <e> <s> we shall look forward to future contributions that they will make to our debates <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that the soviet government could not be expected to agree to inspection <e> <s> while that may very well be true may i ask when they were last asked <e>", "<cs> my lords it was inevitable that in a debate of this kind many statistics should be quoted and i do not propose to add to them <e> <s> it seems to me that if one is trying to strike the present balance sheet in its simplest form one can say this there are certain obvious disadvantages to britain in membership of the community notably the present working of the common agricultural police and the present form of the budget <e> <s> those are both capable of remedy <e> <s> indeed as the noble lord lord gladwyn pointed out they are in effect bound to be remedied because the community will not be able to afford to leave them as they <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not even have to have one ballot to get into this house <e> <s> are we really the right people to tell the other house that they ought to have two ballots <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord buxton has drawn our attention to a problem which as he says not very many people in this country follow continuously <e> <s> every now and again usually as a result of some action of the argentine government we give it close and rather excited attention <e> <s> there are two facts from which one starts <e> <s> first it is entirely unreasonable for anyone to expect that britain wuold abandon sovereignty of the falkland islands against the obvious wishes of all the islanders <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the government believe that the uniform system whatever form it takes will involve the principle that every citizen of every community country will have a vote <e> <s> ought we not therefore to set an example by making sure that in the next european election however it is held every british citizen will have a vote <e> <s> is it not also true that people in this situation probably have a greater right to vote in a european election than for the westminster parliament since they live in europe even if they do not live in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord noticed that when communications are said to be confidential what usually happens is that we read them in the newspapers the next week <e> <s> would it not be more dignified if we were told now <e>", "<cs> my lords parliament is usually willing to extend its welcome and good wishes to an independence bill for each one marks a further stage in the development of the old empire into the commonwealth <e> <s> we should be particularly willing to welcome an independence bill for belize a community that has ordered its own affairs well for some considerable time now and which one has every reason to suppose will continue to be able to do so provided that it is not interfered with from some external quarter <e>", "<cs> my lords i join gladly in the congratulations which have been offered to the noble lords who have made maiden speeches <e> <s> they were interesting informative to the point and commendably brief <e> <s> i propose to make a somewhat specialised contribution to the debate <e> <s> there have been one or two references already to the doctrine of unilateral disarmament <e> <s> it is of course relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords first i am glad to hear that the noble lord does not think that nato is a failure <e> <s> secondly i am certainly not going to be in the position of informing a possible enemy in advance that he need not fear the use of nuclear weapons <e> <s> the important thing is to give him the impression that if he commits aggression it is an inexcusable thing in itself <e> <s> he does it at very great risk and he is not going to be obligingly informed in advance how great or small those risks are <e>", "<cs> there was one passage in the speech of the noble lord lord home which i did not quite follow <e> <s> he said he thought gibraltarians would rather have the guarantee they have now and the special status granted to them now than the cover provided through their membership of the european community <e> <s> but they are not being offered one instead of the other <e> <s> it is not a question of them being offered a choice <e> <s> no one doubts at all that they have the guarantees already given that is not in dispute at all <e> <s> the question is whether we ought to give this further consideration <e> <s> there is no question of the present guarantee being in any way put in jeopardy or exchanged for what is now offered in the bill <e> <s> therefore i did not feel there was weight in that argument <e>", "<cs> i think it has been helpful that the noble minister has been able to make this statement <e> <s> i am not sure that it follows from what he says that the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> we have certainly travelled further than we have before both in the terms of the statement of the president of guatemala and in the degree of explicitness in the governments commitment to the defence of belize <e> <s> we are glad to hear that the forces are to remain there <e>", "<cs> may i say a few words first about the apparent difficulty raised that we should delay independence if we accept this amendment <e> <s> the argument is that if this amendment is made here it must go to another place which will delay the bill and delay independence <e> <s> if that argument were valid at all it would be an argument against making any amendment whatever at this stage in the bill <e> <s> i really do not think the committee can allow itself to be put in that position <e>", "<cs> i should like to say two things <e> <s> if by any ill fortune belize should be attacked and great damage be done there i would hope this country would in any circumstances be prepared to give whatever help suitable to the belizean people <e> <s> i do not think the amendment puts on us in law anything more than lies on us in honour anyhow <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just say this i am sorry to speak so often <e> <s> there has been talk about open-ended commitment <e> <s> the nature of the commitment described in this amendment is the commitment the government say they have already entered into and by which they are bound <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble lord the minister has said and since it appears that nobody will be left stateless i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before we leave this clause i may say with regard to the amendment we have just discussed that a number of us on these benches were very doubtful of the wisdom of the amendment and could not support it in the lobby <e> <s> we felt that this was a matter affecting disagreement among the people of belize on which no useful purpose would be served by this house pronouncing judgment particularly <e>", "<cs> my lords during these discussions misgivings have been expressed and criticisms made but i think we are all of us at one in wishing well to the belizean people in the adventure of independence that lies before them <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the fact that the only country that has ever suffered from a nuclear attack is one that had no nuclear arms and no nuclear allies <e> <s> must we not hope that this country never gets itself into that position <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord take the opportunity of this disarmament week again to ask the soviet government whether they will accept the principle of verification <e>", "<cs> my lords may it not be the case that the russians are reluctant to reach agree <e>", "<cs> and more useful too <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we all have reason to be grateful today both to the noble lord the foreign secretary and to my noble friend lady llewelyn-davies for the distinguished and impressive speeches with which they began this debate setting out though from different viewpoints the major issues that we have to weigh up when we debate foreign affairs <e> <s> i noticed that my noble friend lady llewelyn-davies laid special stress on the problem of proper relations and understanding between this country and <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble earl lord kimberley for raising this question and he is to be congratulated on the fact that he has been able to do it at a time when it is peculiarly <e>", "<cs> my lords at one stage in his speech the noble lord lord elton criticised my noble friends for putting too much emphasis on the crude question of money in the education service and pointed out there were things in addition to the actual <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am saying is that the factors are not discounted sufficiently <e> <s> let the noble lord really examine the question of how much more it costs to educate a child if one has to start with the fact that it does not speak any english at all <e> <s> that is only one of the problems that london has to face in exceptional measure <e> <s> the noble lord will find that london has to spend in the way that it does because it really needs to do so and because to some extent i admit it deliberately sets itself to say and this should make the noble lords heart beat faster we want to maintain a certain standard of excellence <e> <s> if there has been a real standard of excellence in this country it has been in the adult education service provided by inner london <e> <s> an enormous advantage is that it has been one of our great instruments for dealing with problems of racial understanding and that is one of the things that will suffer most severely from the way in which the government are now treating local authorities in general and inner london in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords on the second point i say again that the noble lord has not sufficiently studied the cost of surmounting the difficulties that london has to face <e> <s> on the other point i am quite prepared to admit that a number of children individually can benefit from having an assisted place as compared with children who do not <e> <s> similarly children can benefit from going to a direct grant school as compared with those who do not go to such a school <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i should begin what i trust will be a short speech by congratulating the right reverend prelate the bishop of hereford on his contribution to what has been i think i may rightly say a distinguished debate to which he made a distinguished contribution <e> <s> we hope that we shall hear from him again frequently <e>", "<cs> my lords as we look across europe today is it not gratifying to know that we belong to and take an active part in a powerful alliance of free nations <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble earl the minister two questions <e> <s> first will not some of the cost of the provision of this training fall upon local authorities and how are the government going to help them with that <e> <s> secondly would the minister not agree that there are a number of young people whose wisest choice if they cannot get a job at is to stay on at school not necessarily with a view to university studies later but to improve their general knowledge and standards of literacy and numeracy and does it not follow from the answer given to the noble lord lord kilmarnock that they or their families will be financially disadvantaged as compared with others <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the arrangements made at the foreign affairs council <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indeed grateful to my noble friend lord beswick for having launched us on a stimulating debate of this kind <e> <s> i fear that he may feel a little disappointd in not having reached much in the way of consensus but at least i think we have got this far we are all agreed that the allocation of resources and distribution of income in this country is determined to a large extent by market forces <e> <s> we also agree that those market forces are mitigated and altered by acts of state in the interests of social need greater justice or long-term interests which matter to the nation as a whole but not possibly to the immediate generation of people in charge of resources <e> <s> i think we would all agree that no only is this so but that it ought to be so <e> <s> i think also though with a little less certainty we would all agree that the trend of policy of the present government is to try to shift the emphasis to market forces and away from social and other considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords would not ratification involve that succession to hereditary titles would always be to the eldest child irrrespective of sex <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the noble lord has raised this question because we live in an age of persecution of many kinds and in many countries and as has been suggested sometimes we feel that if we try to protest about it we shall make the situation worse <e> <s> i do not believe that to be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> has any reply been received so far to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are much in the debt of the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley for having instituted this debate it is a subject of very great importance and i think he has succeeded both in the wording of the motion and in what he has said in directing our attention to what are at the moment some of the most pressing aspects of the problem of providing the country with an adequate educational system <e> <s> the motion speaks of calling <e>", "<cs> i confess to no great enthusiasm for the bill but we must recognise that at this stage it has received a second reading so my attitude towards the question whether we should have the words lords or commons in line may be described as one of malevolent neutrality <e> <s> i find some real difficulty here and i did not find the governments exposition entirely helpful <e> <s> it says the bill shall not proceed beyond third reading in the house of commons or if the amendment were accepted beyond third reading in the house of lords <e> <s> there would be a third reading then in whichever house it is in either case it would be after the third reading that the referendum would step in <e>", "<cs> that is how to a layman the bill reads <e> <s> it cannot be denied that it would be perfectly legal and proper for the bill to go ahead so far as third reading in either the commons or lords wherever it turns out to be before the referendum <e>", "<cs> i follow that and it means that the referendum could be stepped in at almost any point provided it comes immediately after third reading that being the latest point <e> <s> if so then the whole argument to which we have been listening whether it should be the commons or lords has to be thought out on different assumptions than those <e>", "<cs> with great respect i think it does <e> <s> in the event and i agree it is very unlikely of the bill starting in your lordships house it cannot go to the commons and the speaker could not give his certificate <e> <s> it could not go to the commons because you have got to have the referendum before it goes beyond the third reading in this house <e> <s> so it starts here and it is only your lordships house which has any word about it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to the noble lord the foreign secretary for the clarity and many noble lords will thank him also for the brevity considering the nature of the subject with which he has handled a most complex and at times an almost anomalous matter <e> <s> it is especially difficult to talk about a constitution where one of the rules of the game if one may so put it is that one ought not to express any opinion about that constitution <e> <s> the noble lord did all this with great skill <e> <s> for it is the case that the british north america act and the constitution of the realm of canada are at present one and the same document <e> <s> if you want to alter the constitution you must alter the act <e> <s> and it has been long understood and established in law and convention that this parliament would always be prepared to alter if it were requested to do so and would only alter according to requests and following them <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble minister recollect that some time in the th century somebody served a writ on the russian ambassador to recover a debt that was due to him and that our parliament was so incensed over that proceeding that it hurriedly passed an act making the serving of writs on ambassadors an offence punishable by corporal punishment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord trefgarne said that it has been agreed through the <e>", "<cs> i had rather hoped that the noble lord lord trefgarne was going to rise again <e> <s> i do see his difficulty the view that he has expressed that he is a spokesman for the government <e> <s> but after all the debate on second reading was enlivened and enriched by contributions from noble lords who knew canada well <e> <s> i wonder whether i may express the hope in view of the unfortunate gagging of the noble lord lord trefgarne which we understand that there may be those who have knowledge of canada and who are able to give us some reassurance on this matter <e> <s> it is an important point <e> <s> we know that this question of land ownership particularly as it affects the indian peoples is important and pressing in canada and there is this rather surprising absence of any constitutional safeguard <e> <s> i hope that we may be able to have a reassurance from some quarter <e>", "<cs> surely even subject to that limitation it is possible for the noble lord lord trefgarne to answer this simple question <e> <s> he was not asked something profound about the canadian constitution but whether he agreed with what the noble and learned lord lord scarman said on second reading <e> <s> surely he could screw up his courage and tell us whether he agrees with that or not because it would help us to get on <e>", "<cs> i do not think that we can get rid of the bill quite as quickly as that <e>", "<cs> if i am allowed to i shall explain why i think so <e> <s> we understand the difficulty of the noble lord lord trefgarne though i am bound to say that i think a number of my noble friends would find it easier to understand his difficulty if in his manner he showed a little more understanding of the very genuine feeling that animates the points that are being raised in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have all been glad to hear the speech the noble lord lord trefgarne has just made <e> <s> this is a bill of great importance of great interest both to us now and to historians <e> <s> we have not always agreed as to how we should approach it but all of us have had the oppotunity to treat it in the way which seems consonant with our duty <e> <s> i appreciate the way in which the noble lord has handled that aspect of the matter today <e>", "<cs> my lords i would strongly agree with what has been said about the need and our duty to support the government in any measures diplomatic or military that they feel necessary to take in the coming weeks and months <e> <s> i think however i am entitled to add this <e> <s> we have been told by several noble lords that there should be no post mortems at any rate not now <e> <s> i would accept that and i am sure they would have given just the same advice if it had been under the guidance of a labour government that this country had landed itself in this position <e> <s> but those of us who are normally the governments opponents have i think the right to say that at an appropriate time there are a number of questions which will still need to be asked and which with great respect to the foreign secretary his speech today did not fully answer <e> <s> i do not propose to pursue that any further <e> <s> we have now to consider what to do in this situation <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord lord belstead is to reply to this debate i think that i may be allowed to do what i did not have the opportunity to do earlier namely to congratulate him on the new and if i may say so terrifying appointment for which he has been preferred <e> <s> we wish him success though we are well aware of the anxieties and difficulties which an appointment of that kind carries with it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have enjoyed much support from the house during this debate but not unanimous support <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that the section of opinion which did not support them found its fullest expression in the speech of the noble lord lord george-brown <e> <s> as he put it the government had wrong-footed the whole thing on occasion after occasion <e> <s> i am afraid there is a good deal of opinion in support of the view that the government wrong-footed it first of all in behaving in a way which enabled the argentine forces to get into the falklands at all <e> <s> that was certainly a case of wrong-footing but that it is i think agreed now is to be the subject of inquiry later on and i hope a very full and expert inquiry <e> <s> meanwhile we have other things to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister quite certain that we have never proposed to take this case to the international court <e> <s> i had understood long ago that we were willing to do so and that the argentines were not <e>", "<cs> my lords

several we have had on this subject was opened by the noble baroness with a speech of very great interest both as to the present situation and what is more fascinating to discuss and more hopeful as to future developments <e> <s> in her reference to the present situation she gave us an exposition of the governments attitude towards the united nations and the recent statement of the secretary-general that could with great advantage have been given by the government in another place a little earlier <e> <s> if it had been given it would have avoided many misunderstandings <e> <s> we are grateful to her for setting the record straight in that respect <e> <s> also she spoke of the need and i noted her words for a long-term solution to this whole problem <e> <s> it is to that that i want to devote the latter part of my speech <e> <s> let us look for the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord macleod of fuinary is speaking to a member of the front bench opposite <e> <s> i hope that he will allow me to get on with my speech <e> <s> i have been here throughout the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree it will be extremely difficult <e> <s> but if we rule out every idea on the grounds that it is going to be difficult we shall never get anywhere <e> <s> he would probably be responsible to the security council <e> <s> the noble lord is afraid of a russian veto <e> <s> the soviet government themselves may want to reconsider their position in the light of possibly the military events that might occur in the next week or two <e> <s> we ought not to start at this stage by saying that we rule it out because it is impossible before we have even tried <e>", "<cs> my lords i am genuinely sorry if i have given the impression that i am anxious to see this issue settled by force <e> <s> what i have said however is that this has to be settled <e> <s> it cannot be left to drag on <e> <s> nobody does a kindness to anybody by pretending that if you cannot settle it without force you must just let it run away <e> <s> i share what i should have thought all noble lords share the earnest anxiety that it should be settled without force but we cannot shirk the possibility that force may have to be used and that i understood to be the partys policy also <e> <s> in sum then i would say that our watchwords must be for events in the present resolution and for the future imagination and understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords i do indeed assure my noble friend that i will read what he said <e> <s> i shall look forward to doing so but i think he in turn will agree that i was not wholly rejecting his ideas <e> <s> i found them difficult to apply fully in the present circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord for repeating this statement to us and i believe that we shall all want to be associated with what was said early in the statement about the efficiency and courage of our forces our relief that there were no casualties among them and our deep regret at the argentine casualties <e> <s> i do not wish to press any further questions about those military aspects because i think they will arise more properly on the next statement except for this it has been reported in some quarters of the press that the action taken with regard to the cruiser general belgrano is losing us support in the united states and in the european community <e> <s> i should be grateful if the noble lord could make any comment which is possible about the truth of reports of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for repeating the statement which we have followed with interest and with <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl the minister aware that there are a number of us who believe that a shift from the principle of unanimity to the principle of majority voting is in the long-term interest of all europe but also that if as he suggested at one stage what is going to happen is that each nation is to rely now on unanimity and now on majority voting as happens to suit its interests at the time that creates an impossible position and the government must do their best to prevent that result <e>", "<cs> my lords what has given this debate its gravity is that we know that we meet at a time when the government may be about to use military force on a greater scale than they have done so far <e> <s> i do not attempt to prophesy in what form those are matters the government have the responsibility of deciding <e> <s> but i think i would say that i do not take the view which seemed to come out from some speeches that the government are going to make a complete switch and abandon diplomacy altogether and concern themselves solely with invasion <e> <s> i think that some speeches have been based upon that assumption <e> <s> i do not think and i hope that the government can confirm this that that is so <e> <s> all we can say for certain or nearly for certain is that at present negotiations have run into a difficult passage and that it seems to be probable that there will be an increase of military action <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble marquess lord ailsa was certainly right to raise this subject for us to discuss this evening <e> <s> we have been in danger recently of thinking that there is only one problem in the field of foreign affairs with which we need concern ourselves <e> <s> i am very glad that he has drawn our attention strikingly to this very different problem and in so doing has given rise to what if i may say so has been a most well-informed and exciting debate <e> <s> i am sure the government have been paying careful attention to the points that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the bulk of the health service is paid for not out of insurance but out of taxation <e> <s> therefore a foreign visitor starts to pay for it every time he has a drink or buys a cigarette or anything which is subject to vat <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that some of our citizens are suffering an injustice which the citizens of seven countries in the community have been delivered from by the action of their governments in one way or another <e> <s> in view of that and in view of the fact that agreement among all the countries in the community at the time of the next election is unlikely would it not be reasonable at least to have some draft legislation ready <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been several references in this debate to the speech delivered near here by president reagan <e> <s> to my mind the most significant thing about that was that the criticisms that we have heard this evening and indeed other criticisms could equally be made in president reagans own country by president reagans own fellow citizens and that this is not so of the statesmen who come from the countries of eastern europe <e> <s> it is this fact that helps to forge the powerful link between ourselves and the united states that when everything is said and done when every criticism we have made of united states policy has been made it remains true that we are both together fortunately with a number of other countries countries who believe in the right of the citizen to speak his own mind and to have a share in the choosing of his government <e> <s> we shall get the whole perspective of world events wrong on disarmament and everything else if we pretend that that fact is not there <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that he preferred to describe this as a change of emphasis rather than a change of heart <e> <s> may we take it that this confirms the view long held on these benches that the government have not got a heart <e>", "<cs> my lords before the prime minister visits china <e>", "<cs> my lords before the prime minister visits china could she be advised to stop using the word marxist as a term of abuse <e>", "<cs> i am moved to take part in this debate although my own experience of industrial relations has been very brief by the fact that such as it is i think it is here to the point <e> <s> a good many years ago i held the office of under-secretary of state for war under i may say the wise guidance of my noble friend lord shinwell who was secretary of state for war at the time <e> <s> one of my duties every three months was to meet the trade union representatives of the civilian employees at the war office and they ranged over a fairly wide field <e> <s> of all the duties i ever had to perform that was certainly the toughest <e> <s> i remember always coming out at the end of the morning in a state of complete physical and almost mental exhaustion <e> <s> the trade union representatives although entirely friendly were extremely hard-bitten they knew their case and they could invariably present it with great skill <e> <s> consequently some of the episodes have stuck in my mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i must make the same apology as my noble friend lord brockway <e> <s> i did not add my name earlier to the list of speakers <e> <s> but it is very difficult to listen to this debate unmoved particularly if i may say so if you are somebody who like the noble lord lord elton has held ministerial responsibility and has had to consider these awful questions where you say to yourself if in this case i make the decision that leads towards mercy the decision that will be well <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose we have got to accept that this intruder has not committed an offence and therefore cannot be punished but is there any way of preventing him and members of his family from making substantial sums of money from the newspapers over this <e> <s> otherwise we have a situation in which it is positively profitable for people to behave in this manner <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not important that the peace studies should contain an account of the important part played by the atlantic alliance in keeping the peace over the last years <e>", "<cs> my lords ought not the noble lord to be influenced by the fact that when we were discussing the british nationality act the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter took a contrary view <e> <s> should there not be more joy over his repentance than over all the just persons who voted the right way in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we on these benches view with horror the recent developments in beirut and agree very strongly with the government action supporting security council resolution <e> <s> while accepting his proposition that there cannot be stability in the region until the aspirations of the palestinian people are met would he not also agree that there cannot be stability in the region either until the natural desire of the people of israel for security is met <e>", "<cs> my lords a great many different opinions have been expressed on many topics but we are all unanimous i think in congratulating the noble lord lord maclehose of beoch on his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> it was a special pleasure for me to listen to him having profited from his wise advice when we both worked together at the foreign office <e> <s> since then i like many others have admired from a distance his most impressive career in hong kong and the great services rendered to hong kong to britain and to mankind at large by the success he had there <e> <s> i would add the hope that the government will decide to follow at least some of the advice that he gave <e> <s> we on these benches listened with particular interest to what he said about a more favourable attitude towards citizens from dependent commonwealth countries who come here as students <e> <s> i would particularly commend that advice to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood my noble friend to believe that this country should not own or make or possess any nuclear weapons itself or have any nuclear weapons on its territory from any other country <e>", "<cs> i do not think it is my lords <e> <s> it greatly weakens our own defence and puts us at odds with our most powerful ally <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend can persuade people that we can deprive ourselves of all our nuclear weapons and put ourselves at odds with our most powerful ally and not be at risk he may try to do it but he does not convince me and i do not think i am alone in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate is quite right about the stand i was taking <e> <s> the answer to his question is no <e>", "<cs> my lords when we first knew the text of the british nationality bill i think that there were a great many of us both in this house and elsewhere who felt that it was a profoundly unsatisfactory bill and that that concept of british dependent territory citizenship was not a satisfactory one <e> <s> what has now happened is that for a concatenation of reasons this particular example of its madness has appeared and the factors in this case that make us aware of the defects of the nationality act are as follows <e> <s> first there is the natural feeling that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord paget and the noble marquess lord salisbury have described to us a number of the acts of cruelty and tyranny occurring in zimbabwe because although neither i nor i think anyone here is in a position to state exactly how much of these accounts we believe i do not think there can be any doubt that there have been serious acts of cruelty and tyranny and that in many cases the victims of them have been white people and people for whom this government have morally if not legally a responsibility <e> <s> we shall therefore want to hear from the government so far as it is prudent for them to tell us what steps they are taking to help these unfortunate people <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords while adding my congratulations to the minister may i ask him whether he recollects that the old london county council was destroyed because the labour party kept winning the elections and that the glc was put in its place in the hope that it would be a tory body <e> <s> since that hope has not been fulfilled it is now proposed to abolish the glc <e> <s> would the minister not agree that we really cannot have london government turned upside down every time the tory party is disappointed in the elections <e>", "<cs> my lords a paper such as the one we are discussing invites us to consider the cost in life resources and weapons of the operation that was carried out in the falklands <e> <s> in view of that i think it right to restate a view that i have expressed before here it is something which i think is generally shared <e> <s> whatever the cost there is no doubt at all that it was right for great britain to engage in that operation <e> <s> if we are attempting to weigh up the balance sheet at any time we ought to ask ourselves what would be the situation now if we had not done so <e> <s> the situation would be a much more dangerous world with nobody quite certain where aggression was going to break out next a situation in this country where there would be a profound loss of morale spirit and direction and a situation for the unhappy falkland islanders of bondage under a bitterly hostile military tyranny <e> <s> we would do well to remember that if at any time we are appalled at the cost that was inevitably incurred in sending the task force and winning the victory <e>", "<cs> my lords we have all listened to that speech with the greatest interest <e> <s> i most earnestly hope that unless the governments mind is already irrevocably made up they will listen to the plea which was so eloquently put forward because it appears from what has been said that they are in danger for the sake of a minor economy of destroying something of real value <e> <s> indeed i am reminded and this has occurred to me several times in thinking of the <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may follow up that point can the minister tell us whether soon is sooner than shortly and shortly earlier than early <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside and certain other noble lords have suggested during the debate that there is something ignoble in raking over the embers and digging up the past and that we ought rather to talk and think about the future <e> <s> it is understandable that noble lords should say that but if we follow that doctrine we stultify one of the main purposes of parliament and let us remember the situation on that saturday in april when the house met <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am saying is that if you had found them they would not have delivered a unanimous verdict of not guilty if it had been a labour government that was in the dock <e> <s> and that we all know we need not be too mealy-mouthed about this <e> <s> this is how politics works in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is anxiety in gibraltar lest the possible closure of the dockyard may make it impossible for gibraltar to maintain her identity whatever legal safeguards are adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to stress my full and cordial agreement with what has just been said by my noble friend lady david <e> <s> we made it clear from the start how much we oppose this assisted places scheme because it seems to stem from the general approach of the conservative party towards education <e> <s> they do not see it being their duty so much to provide as good an education as they can to everybody as they do to set to work to make sure that greater educational opportunities are offered to some children than to others <e> <s> in many instances they show this predilection and the assisted places scheme is one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble minister help me to understand something which has always puzzled me about this kind of provision <e> <s> when the government propose the injection of public money into the economy to revive it we are asked to welcome it as wise and sensible and indeed we do <e> <s> but when similar proposals are made by any of the opposition parties they are regarded as inflationary and impracticable <e> <s> why is this <e>", "<cs> my lords we are at least agreed that we all want peace <e> <s> we know too that there is one way in which we can get it and that is by making it clear that this country will never in any circumstances use armed force <e> <s> we then have to stop and consider what is the exact price of that <e> <s> it means that this country would be in a position where it could not resist any demands that were made of it <e> <s> the point that i want to stress is this <e> <s> it is a complete mistake to suppose that if you adopt this pacifist conclusion what you end up with is anything that you can really call peace because very likely you will be required by one of the major powers in the world to become part of their military machine <e> <s> those nations in eastern europe which do not for obvious reasons try to resist the soviet union are part of its military machine <e> <s> they have none of the safety which is sometimes pictured by those who talk of neutrality or of unilateral disarmaments <e>", "<cs> i suggest that the noble lord lord boardman has got it the wrong way round <e> <s> he was arguing that we should not admit the press because we would not get better administration as a result <e> <s> surely as a free country we must start from the assumption that the press should be admitted and anybody who does not want them to be there should be able to show that we would get worse administration if they were admitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble viscount will allow me to say how much i always enjoy his speeches <e> <s> i think that we all do <e> <s> he brings into this house a breath from the wide and varied world outside as he tells us of his wide and varied acquaintance <e> <s> we have just learned of his acquaintance with moonlighting unemployed and with unemployed women with very wealthy husbands <e> <s> in an earlier intervention today he told us about the unemployed using their redundancy pay to buy villas in spain <e> <s> the last time we had a debate of this sort they were having holidays in corfu <e> <s> if only we can go on at this rate the standard of life of the unemployed and therefore <e> <s> presumably <e>", "<cs> my lords am i not right in supposing that among the chief suppliers of gold today are the soviet union and the republic of south africa <e> <s>

am one of those who visited wilton park was acquantied with its work and knew and admired the late dr koeppler <e> <s> it has been a very sad unhappy story to which we have been listening <e> <s> i am not going to go in detail over the facts because that has been well done by previous speakers <e> <s> what i want to do is to draw the attention of the noble lord the minister to this point <e> <s> a great deal of damage has now been done by the publicity that has arisen <e> <s> the publicity was bound to arise in view of what had been done this was not something about which people could keep silent <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has to ask himself whether there is at this stage any way in which he can mitigate and reduce the damage that has been done to wilton park and to the whole conception of britains presentation of herself abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords we are much indebted to the noble earl lord cathcart for initiating this debate and i think that he must feel rewarded by the quality of debate that has followed <e> <s> it has been full of reliable personal first-hand information from many parts of the world and it has been very soberly and earnestly argued <e> <s> i would add that my own impression is that it has ended in more agreement than i thought likely at the beginning of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords in an attempt to weigh up numbers of votes numbers of seats and so on there has been some dispute as to what the verdict of the electorate actually meant but i think one can say that whether or not one likes it it is true that as a result of the election the government are now in a stronger position to resist propaganda for unilateral nuclear disarmament and they are also in a stronger position to go ahead on the assumption that membership of the european community is now the permanent choice of this country <e> <s> no matter how one weighs up the figures and no matter what might be ones own predilections i do not believe that one can avoid either of those conclusions <e>", "<cs> and not to engage in a process of mutual destruction <e> <s> it is always much easier in politics if you can have an absolutely clear issue of this is right and that is wrong <e> <s> one of the things which upheld people very much during the terrible periods of the last war was the fact that there have been few cases in history where the conflict of right and wrong was so plain <e> <s> however when we look at the problems between east and west today we know that when we have made every criticism that can rightly be made of the soviet government we still have to live with them <e> <s> we have still to accept that considerable parts of the world are influenced by the soviet government and are more disposed to work with them than we are <e> <s> so we have to keep our defences resolute on the one hand and our minds and our temper under control on the other <e> <s> that is not always easy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will have noticed that this

projects and plans for publication now being considered by the schools council <e> <s> will they be taken on by the curriculum body and brought to fruition <e> <s> what will happen to the considerable

lord stoddart on his maiden speech to which we all listened with interest and respect <e> <s> he spoke with great force evidently after very careful consideration of the issues involved in this problem and we shall welcome hearing him again <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great interest to the remarks which the noble baroness has just made when she quoted the views of one of the islanders on these matters because she is the first speaker in this debate to have quoted the views of an islander <e> <s> for example i noticed when the noble baroness lady young was speaking to us

kind for which i was asking <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that all of us who are moving these amendments know that it would be quite impracticable for them to be carried <e> <s> what we are endeavouring to do is to draw the governments attention to what we believe to be the particular importance of certain subjects <e> <s> there was a time in the history of

population as a whole we are at a disadvantage <e> <s> that is one reason for giving particular importance to this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour has put forward what is a comparatively recent doctrine in local government <e> <s> we have all understood for a long time that a local authority must obey the law that the law lays down certain rules as to what it may or may not do and that it neither can disobey them nore ought to attempt to do so <e> <s> now we are putting forward the doctrine that in addition to that they must not only respect the law but

government therefore should not in this bill help local authotrities who are engaged in that type of activity <e>", "<cs> my lords local authorities can of course deal with that situation by not creating schools of this kind <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be that local authorities would give up the attempt to restore separatist education and i believe that that would be a desirable result <e> <s> that is the case that i have made and i repeat it <e> <s> i feel therefore that we should test the opinion of the house on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord

financial difficulty <e> <s> i do regard it therefore as a matter of particular regret that it should be the subject of proposed cuts at the present time and i most earnestly ask the government to reconsider them <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to ask the government if they have no proposals for privatising these bands <e> <s> have they no faith in their own principles <e>", "<cs> my lords we know both from what has been advanced in this debate so far and not refuted and from general and common knowledge that there are one or two important facts that we cannot dodge <e> <s> the first is that about one-seventh of the population has a standard of living that is a disgrace to the community as a whole and a reproach to the rest of us <e> <s> secondly the degree of inequality between the rich and the poor has been increasing during the lifetime of and as a result of the policies of this government in particular their policies in relation to taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that this country is fortunate in possessing the liberties to which he referred and that it is fortunate also in having the arms and the allies which make it possible to defend those liberties <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the regulations illustrate the point which several of us made when the bill was being discussed that really the money for the projects ought to be new money and not money taken from local education authorities <e> <s> now that we see the way it is going to work spelt out that point becomes even more clear <e> <s> however we have discussed that and i do not want to develop it further here <e> <s> in addition i have only one question to ask <e> <s> it has probably an extremely common-sense answer which i ought to know but i am afraid that i do not <e> <s> regulation describes what is to happen to applications relating to approved expenditure during the quarters commencing st april st july and st october <e> <s> what do you do about applications for the other quarter of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister used the expression make-believe jobs <e> <s> what is his definition of that phrase <e> <s> recently we had a report stating that a number of children were suffering in their education because the schools they were being taught in were in very bad repair <e> <s> would a programme to repair those schools he a make-believe job <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord molson ran through the vicissitudes of the bill from <e>", "<cs> repeatedly conservatives have urged on us the importance of voluntary and charitable organisations in the administration of the welfare state and of public welfare generally <e> <s> but all that has gone by the board <e> <s> it is voluntary and charitable organisations that will be in danger as a result of some of the measures that we have passed in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if mr gorbachev should come here can we persuade him to follow the prime ministers example and say a few words about how he deals with industrial disputes in his country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount who has just spoken said that he did not see why the depoliticising of local government should be a tory slogan <e> <s> i know that it is a tory slogan but it has never been what they believed <e> <s> to judge by their actions they have always taken the view that one goes into local government in as aggressive a party political frame of mind as one can <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are all indebted to the noble lord lord home of the hirsel for starting this interesting debate <e> <s> it is significant how many noble lords seem to have accepted what i understood to be the principle he was putting forward about the nature of the soviet government from the start that it is by its nature a propagandist state it believes that it has a cause to promote throughout the world it believes that it is the ultimate destiny of the world to come after greater or lesser more or fewer upheavals under communist rule <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may i beg the noble lords pardon <e>", "<cs> it is interesting that in this debate so far nearly every speaker has drawn attention to the fact that in london and in every other metropolis there are certain functions which are unavoidably metropolitan <e> <s> sometimes they are of a technical nature such as fire fighting and waste disposal and sometimes of a personal nature involving for instance the wisest way to give help to voluntary bodies <e> <s> but that they exist is now not seriously in doubt <e> <s> all the correspondence we receive unprovoked by any advertisements there may be in the press brings that out <e> <s> the government themselves admit it by the fact that in the bill they do not intend to return these functions to the boroughs they create a hotchpotch of joint boards government nominees advisory bodies and so forth <e>", "<cs> i quite understand that the noble earl lord gowrie is annoyed <e> <s> i am showing what the bill is really about and what we all know it is about <e>", "<cs> if that is the case i am delighted <e> <s> that is what this is about <e> <s> if the government had had the nerve they would have introduced a bill of that kind and we should have known exactly where we were <e> <s> it is because they are not doing so that we have this hotch-potch of joint boards and of this that and the other which does not stand up to any serious intellectual examination <e> <s> those are the reasons which convince me that we should support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we shall all wish to congratulate the noble baroness lady cox on her first major appearance at that box and her first appearance on an educational matter <e> <s> she will have not only our congratulations but our admiration and sympathy on having put up so spirited a defence of one of the silliest pieces of legislation that has ever come before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the difference is absurd but the way to remedy it is to bring the english practice in line with the scottish <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord diamond has put our dilemma very well <e> <s> if the government were able to give us an assurance that they have no intention of trying to overturn the decision which the committee took recently about amendments nos <e> <s> c and d we should then know exactly where we are and i think would accept the idea that there was not much point in proceeding with these amendments <e> <s> but i am not going to bother to ask the noble lord whether he can give such an undertaking because i know perfectly well that he cannot <e> <s> if i had any doubts about that the expression on the chief whips face would dispel them <e> <s> therefore i think we must proceed on the basis that the decision that the committee has recently taken could be reversed and that therefore there is some importance in these amendments <e>", "<cs> i think when the chief whip reflects he will realise he has said exactly what i prophesied he would say that the government cannot and will not give us an undertaking that a decision already taken by the committee will not be reversed <e> <s> i repeat therefore that we must proceed on the assumption that that decision might be reversed and there would then be some merit in these amendments <e>", "<cs> with respect i think it is still my speech <e>", "<cs> i have been trying to get on with this <e> <s> as i have said this is still my speech although there have been five interventions <e> <s> i rose only because it has been represented to me from several quarters that there is deep and widespread feeling against the powers that the secretary of state is given in the bill to declare roads trunk roads without any of the usual safeguards <e> <s> i was interested in the matter because i am acquainted with both ends of the south circular road <e> <s> when i was a small boy in south-east london i attended a school which was bang on a road which is now part of the south circular road <e> <s> it was considered even in the days when i attended that school to be a rather dangerous and busy road <e> <s> the school is still there and is still used and the idea of its becoming a trunk road is extremely undesirable <e> <s> more recently in my life i have become acquainted with west london <e> <s> although the south circular did not run through what used to be my constituency it runs very near it and there is other provision in the bill for what are called designated roads that will affect roads in almost any part of london <e> <s> the point in every case is that the secretary of state is given almost arbitrary powers about them <e>", "<cs> i think i have listened enough to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i do not think so <e> <s> the noble lord seems to make up his constitutional doctrines as he goes along <e> <s> i am afraid that they do not carry very much conviction with us <e>", "<cs> i think it is worthwhile looking at the reason why a unitary system of education in inner london has persisted ever since <e> <s> if one has an education authority that is very small it is not able to make a variety of provision either as my noble friend baroness serota suggested for handicapped children or for the very varying demands not only of children but also of adults who use the education service for unusual pieces of knowledge for the study of languages which only a few people want to study <e> <s> if the education authority is too small it cannot make that degree of variety of provision but if the education authority is too large it might be difficult for its members to know the whole area for which they are supposed collectively to be responsible <e>", "<cs> i am a little sorry that the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill should have mentioned the tragedy of brussels in connection with this debate <e> <s> it seems to be completely inappropriate <e> <s> that was a terrible serious event and this is a silly and trivial bill <e> <s> i do not think that the events in brussels <e>", "<cs> i have been trying to get on with

this passage i find it more and more difficult to follow <e> <s> but i have noted what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> we may want to return to this at a later stage but for the present i would ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must say the noble baroness always phrases it very charmingly but she is rather obstinate about this <e> <s> i listened in some respects to the arguments that were advanced about the under-fives but this really does not seem to make sense <e> <s> at present if you are in scotland the lad over can always avoid corporal punishment by deciding to exempt himself from it <e> <s> why should you insist that there must be the right to inflict corporal punishment on over-s in england although it cannot be done in scotland <e> <s> i really cannot make sense of this <e> <s> i should have thought that if we are to have a bill of this kind at all and i share the view of the noble lord lord marsh that it is rather unfortunate that we are having it at all indeed i think this is everybodys view really including the governments we might take the opportunity to clear up one or two anomalies and one is this anomaly between english and scottish law about the over-s <e> <s> i cannot feel that the case has been made out and i should like to test the opinion of the committee on this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not happy with this <e> <s> it has turned out very much as i thought it would <e> <s> but i think that on the whole i shall ask leave now to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the government will feel that they can accept this amendment <e> <s> it is not subject to some of the objections that have been raised to similar previous amendments <e> <s> for example it does not compel the london boroughs to do this or that it simply requires that the secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i was interested to hear the noble lord lord zuckerman say that he had complete confidence in our present system of mutual deterrence <e> <s> that was one of the topics on which i hoped to say a few words that of nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i join very readily with the most deserved compliments which the previous speakers have paid to the minister and to my noble friend baroness birk for their conduct of the business of this bill <e> <s> but when my noble friend baroness bi raises the question of whether we can say anything nice about the bill i find it more difficult <e> <s> at the court of king george iii there was a particularly spiteful diarist who once committed to paper his opinion of the appearance of one of the ladies of the court <e> <s> he gave it as his judgment that the first bloom of her ugliness was wearing off <e> <s> i am wondering whether one can say that about this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords no speech from anybody on this side would be complete without an interruption from the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> as i was saying i think one could just pay the bill the compliment paid by the diarist of king george iiis time <e> <s> but it remains a very unsavoury picture at the end <e>", "<cs> my lords are not hiroshima and nagasaki grim examples of what can happen to a country that gets involved in a conflict with a nuclear power and has itself no power of retaliation <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear from what the noble baroness has told the house that these vital assurances were given by the palestinians not to the british government directly but to the jordanians <e> <s> in view of the importance of the whole issue and since the assurances were absolutely vital to holding the conversations at all was it not imprudent to be content with anything less than a direct face-to-face commitment by the palestinians before they came here <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord caradon referred to the words in the gracious speech <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think i do <e> <s> the only trouble is that in south africa it has been practised on so much larger a scale and with so many more instruments of destruction <e> <s> the point i was making was that when you say to a man that because of his race or his skin colour he is to be permanently deprived of political rights you do him an insult that nothing will wipe out and an insult that not only he resents but that other people of his race or similar races throughout the world resent <e> <s> that is why what is happening in south africa has now become an issue of world importance <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness referred earlier to high spirits <e> <s> are we to understand that if one shouts down keir hardie or a member of the fabian society that is high spirits but if one shouts down a tory minister that is hooliganism <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to express my thanks to those noble lords who have contributed to the debate and enriched it with so many varied experiences <e> <s> we have had as good as one could expect from a member of the government on almost any topic <e> <s> it is not in my nature to say much more than that about any member of any government <e> <s> but for what it is i say it <e> <s> i only hope that those zealous people up and down the country who are engaged in the work of community education will feel that we have given them a fair run and interested the government the house and perhaps a wider audience in the valuable work that they are doing <e> <s> with that i ask leave to withdraw the motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to my noble friend lord irving of dartford for initiating this debate on the problems of the nations schools <e> <s> there cannot be any doubt that of those problems at present the most pressing is the dispute with teachers and the fact that teachers are taking industrial action with the inevitable damage that follows from that to the children and the education system as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords the trouble was that the noble baroness objected to comprehensive education <e> <s> that must have meant that she was in favour of some form of selective education <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness is trying to have it both ways <e> <s> she is trying to arrange some means of selecting children for one school rather than another <e> <s> we have tried that <e> <s> it produced the most remarkable nonsense <e> <s> if anyone wants to study it they should read the reports of the conservative womens conference in the s which displayed most devastatingly the muddles into which one got if one tried to proceed on any kind of selective system of education <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady cox must be congratulated on having started what has proved to be a wide-ranging debate <e> <s> indeed the title of it ranged fairly widely including the two perhaps allied but quite distinct subjects the politicisation of education and the violation of the principle of freedom of speech <e>", "<cs> my lords excuse me but that was not at oxford <e> <s> that was on another occasion in scotland <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can he reassure me on this point <e> <s> he has told us on many occasions that any code that comes into existence under this bill would have to be vetted and approved i believe that those were his words by this house <e> <s> i have heard it argued on more than one occasion that it is no longer constitutionally proper for this house to reject a regulation or statutory instrument of any kind that has been approved in another place <e> <s> under this bill if a code is drawn up approved by the other house and then comes to this house if it is what the majority want to do have we the right to reject it <e> <s> if not the assurances of the noble lord that it has to be vetted and approved by this house cannot carry any weight <e>", "<cs> my lords i was greatly fascinated by the speech of the noble lord lord beloff and i am sorry that he is not present in the chamber now <e>", "<cs> my lords he has begun the process of crossing the floor <e> <s> i am bound to say that i do not believe we can make much use of the noble lords ideas in our discussion of this bill <e> <s> if we proceeded along the lines suggested by the noble lord we would find that we could not get anywhere without first tearing the bill to bits and then starting afresh with a totally different document because the noble lords philosophy is totally different from that of the bill <e> <s> while i found some of the things that the noble lord said stimulating and worth further consideration i felt that he like some other noble lords was profoundly underestimating the part that has been played in the development of education in this country as in other public services by local government <e>", "<cs> i find myself in agreement with these two amendments and particularly with the second one proposed by the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> if this decision on priorities is to be made by the secretary of state it ought most certainly to be subject to the scrutiny of parliament <e> <s> that would mean that it would be preceded if the secretary of state hoped to get the agreement of parliament by thorough discussion as has been suggested with hmis with the teaching profession with industry and with people qualified to give him good advice on this matter of priorities <e> <s> i hope therefore that if any change is made it will include both of these amendments particularly that of the noble lord lord henderson <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the leader of the opposition in this house suggested that there was a connection between these crimes that have recently been committed against british subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think anyone will disagree with the harsh criticism of the libyan government which has been pronounced by the noble lord who has just spoken and indeed by the noble viscount who opened the debate and other noble lords but we have to ask ourselves the question was the american action wise <e>", "<cs> my lords does what the noble lord the minister has said mean that it is the conservative partys intention to introduce legislation making it possible for private landlords to increase rent but that prudently it does not intend to do that this side of a general election <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are all in great debt to the noble baroness lady seear for having instituted this extremely interesting debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord beloff seemed rather to regret that having started with a motion that promoted partisan rancour as he put it we had changed to something else <e> <s> but he did his level best to bring us back to the grounds of partisan rancour so he need not complain <e> <s> we also join in our congratulations to the noble lord lord kirkwood on his very interesting and very well informed speech to which we all listened with great interest <e> <s> we look forward to hearing from him again <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask this question <e> <s> if this procedure is followed and an amendment such as this goes through the commons and comes back here is it the opinion of the chief whip or of members of the government generally that this house constitutionally and properly could disagree with that amendment if it wished <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that he does not seem to have answered the question put to him by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> the question if i understood it correctly asked whether it was going to be necessary to bring people from outside kent into that county and if so what was being done about housing them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the astounding prosperity the minister mentions the reason the government have reached such an exceptional peak of popularity at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great interest to the noble lord lord murton but it was not clear to me what he thought we ought to do except to wait for increasingly liberal actions by the south african government <e> <s> i can only say that no lesson from experience suggests to us that that will get us anywhere at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not clear about the effect of the answer which the noble baroness gave to her noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> is it the fact that at present the french government are contemplating a considerable sale of arms to syria that the british government have made it clear that we should deplore that but that we do not yet know what the french decision will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the noble baroness this question <e> <s> has it been the intention of the french government to make a sale of arms to syria and how does that matter stand now <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to refer to two points <e> <s> the first is the cost of defence and the second is the reykjavik conference and the connected problems of nuclear deterrence <e> <s> i see that in the gracious speech the government say that they will <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that what the noble lord says can be disputed <e> <s> i disagree with it for that reason <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that one could begin any debate on defence by asking the simple question why do we need it at all <e> <s> if we think of the defence of this country we think first of that long frontier running through europe between the countries of the warsaw pact and the countries of nato <e> <s> however the longest international frontier in the world is that between canada and the united states <e> <s> that frontier is totally militarily unguarded from one end to the other <e> <s> that is because the relationships between the two powers are such that each has complete confidence in the other <e> <s> as regards the frontier we must face in europe there is no such confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i am still not quite clear because my noble friend used the word persuasion <e> <s> it seems to me that in this context that means persuasion of the rest of nato to adopt a non-nuclear policy <e> <s> i am bound to say i find that rather alarming <e> <s> if that persuasion was successful we would have not only a non-nuclear britain but a non-nuclear nato <e> <s> it is as if one had decided to play a game of cards in which one of the rules was that ones own hand would not be dealt any trump cards <e> <s> that must be the situation if it is assumed that nato is a non-nuclear alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is a fortunate coincidence that on the day when we are debating the second reading of this bill there should be an article in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter attacks the amendment particularly on the ground that it contains provision for the secretary of state in certain circumstances to set the results of the advisory council aside <e> <s> he regards that as a great defect which will arouse ill-will <e> <s> but exactly the same objection can be launched against the bill itself in its present form <e> <s> under the bill as it stands we have an advisory council which is created by the secretary of state it then proceeds to make recommendations <e> <s> it is open to the secretary of state to make an order which either agrees with those recommendations makes modifications in them or in a sweeping phrase makes other arrangements <e>", "<cs> i cannot see that there is all the difference in the world between the two <e> <s> the secretary of state will take the action at the last moment in any case <e> <s> under this bill first we have the advisory council making recommendations <e> <s> they will then be considered by the secretary of state <e> <s> then he will decide whether he agrees with them in whole in part or not at all <e> <s> there will possibly come back from him the disappointing reply to the teachers that he is either making modifications or what are called other arrangements <e> <s> if he does that he then must come to parliament and get an affirmative resolution of both houses <e> <s> the procedure is exactly the same in both cases <e>", "<cs> my lords several years ago the late lord mountbatten made a powerful and much-remembered speech about defence in which he drew attention to the fearful consequences if the human race were to become involved in a nuclear war <e> <s> that part of his speech is often quoted and used as an argument one way or another <e> <s> he then went on to ask what in those circumstances we ought to do <e> <s> he then immediately said in effect that one thing we must not do is to upset what is called the balance of terror that exists between the two great power blocs in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been argued often throughout history whether nations choose their friends and allies or alternatively their rivals and enemies on ideological grounds or whether they do it on more materialistic grounds of desire for colonies territory and so on <e> <s> one can select examples from history to prove one thesis or the other <e> <s> however it seems to me that at the present time ideology is the chief factor determining how nations line themselves up <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord mcintosh may well feel gratified at having set on foot this most interesting and if i may say so widely <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord aberdare has advised the house to accept the second reading of the bill and to accept the instruction <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for both pieces of advice which i hope and trust the house will follow <e> <s> in view of that and the detailed account given by my noble friend lord raglan of the problems involved in the creation of this marina i need not say very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i was deeply sorry when i heard the noble viscount lord eccles use the words in conclusion because it seemed to me that we had just reached the really important and interesting point of what he was going to tell us <e> <s> it has shown us beyond doubt that the present distribution of wealth in this country is seriously at fault in some respects <e> <s> one important aspect of that is the inadequate education which some receive compared with the opportunities open to others <e> <s> as the noble viscount put it the strong ought to help the weak <e> <s> i was anxiously waiting to see how that was to be done <e> <s> it could i suppose be done by taxation but that was exactly what the noble viscount had ruled out <e> <s> we shall have to wait until he next addresses the house for the further instalment of what has been a most stimulating and impressive speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to begin my speech by extending on behalf of the house warm congratulations to the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> he comes to the house with experience in the armed forces in the other place and in government especially in the foreign office <e> <s> i am sure that his contributions will be of great value and interest to us as the years go by <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i should first like to refer to the argument put forward by the noble lord lord aberdare suggesting that the house ought not to oppose the third reading of a private bill <e> <s> the noble lord stated clearly the dilemma in which a noble lord is placed when he is told at second reading <e> <s> you must not vote against second reading so as to give a committee the opportunity to examine the bill <e> <s> at third reading he is then told the committee has examined the bill so you must not disagree with them <e> <s> if noble lords accept that argument there is no stage at which the house as a whole can express a view <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first place those concessions were made during the course of discussion and as a result of criticism <e> <s> secondly they do not apply to all fishermen <e> <s> there will still be fishermen in swanage who as a result of this bill will <e>", "<cs> my lords i will accept that on one or two points the noble lord is able to show that there were exaggerations <e> <s> on the other hand those who were urging for a no-vote were not like those on the other side who were going round presenting pens and pencils to people who would vote in the required way <e> <s> if we are going to argue as to how the poll was conducted and as to the arguments that were advanced there is quite a lot that could be said but i doubt whether there is very much profit in doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords some years ago there was in circulation a bitter jest which i believe was of american origin and ran as follows do not believe all this you hear about a housing shortage it is just a rumour put about by people who have nowhere to live <e> <s> that rumour has become louder and more insistent <e> <s> it is fearful that the problem of homelessness is twice as great as it was only a few years ago <e> <s> one of the results of that is the putting of people into bed-and-breakfast accommodation which by common consent is wildly expensive often squalid damaging to family life to the upbringing of children and the opportunity for children to benefit from the education which a benevolent government may provide for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that this statement uses a great many words to tell a very simple story <e> <s> since ilea is to be abolished because it has a labour majority just as earlier the greater london council and earlier still the london county council were abolished for the same reason would it not have been more candid and courageous for the government to tell us plainly what they are doing and why instead of trying to cover it up with this verbose camouflage <e>", "<cs> my lords could one begin by discussing the fact that membership of nato is voluntary and membership of the warsaw pact is not <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that she first said that the future of ilea was a detail a view with which most londoners would not agree and secondly that it is wrong for people who disagree with the government to say so <e> <s> does she stand by that <e>", "<cs> my lords meanwhile has the minister noted that if we put together her last two answers this would suggest that the policy of the government towards education in london and the south-east is for fewer teachers and more civil servants <e> <s> is this quite what the secretary of state for education had in mind when he first started his grandiose plans <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is some years since the government of south africa fell into the hands of a group of people who put into practice the policy of apartheid <e> <s> since then a number of things have happened <e> <s> there have been what were called reforms in apartheid shifts of policy this way and that <e> <s> but one fact has remained true throughout <e> <s> the situation is that three-quarters of the population of south africa have been denied any kind of political rights <e> <s> they have no votes they cannot legally engage in organised political activity <e> <s> not only is that the case now but the south african government make it clear that this is to be a permanent condition <e> <s> they are not saying as imperial powers have sometimes said we cannot give you votes because you are not yet ready to exercise political power <e> <s> in effect they are saying because you are of a particular race you are permanently debarred from any legal participation in the government of your country <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to adult basic education <e> <s> is he aware that one of the best examples of that education is that provided by the ilea and that no one knows what will happen to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the suggestion has been made that some of us on this side of the house are complacent about the state of british education <e> <s> despite that i shall repeat a fact that has already been mentioned <e> <s> in the last or years during which there has been a steady move away from selective to comprehensive secondary education the standard of educational attainment in secondary school children as shown by examination results has steadily improved year after year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness knows perfectly well that i was not referring to her <e> <s> let me give one example of the special service that london can render a service which is difficult for any other local authority to render <e> <s> it is the amazing network of what used to be called night schools or more proudly evening institutes which provide almost every kind of education <e> <s> they provide basic education for many people who come to this country with no knowledge of our language and who perhaps are not literate in any language but wish to acquire it <e> <s> there are people seeking vocational education in order to obtain and keep jobs <e> <s> there are older people who want cultural education to enrich their old age <e> <s> every kind of service is provided in the evening institute network which works with voluntary education bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with great pleasure that i congratulate most warmly the noble lord lord knights on the interesting and extremely well-informed speech that he has contributed to our discussions <e> <s> i am sure that i express the opinion of the whole house when i say that <e>", "<cs> my lords yes and he would have to prove it to a jury who might be faced with arguments from other sources such as the prime minister or other people whom he had seen who took the view that he was wrong <e> <s> that is why i drew the analogy with saint joan <e> <s> the people who were trying her were saying to themselves is it really true that a comparatively uneducated girl knows more about theology than bishops and archbishops and rather more about strategy and tactics in the use of artillery than generals and field marshals <e> <s> if that sort of thing is to happen how on earth are ordinary chaps to be able to run the business of the world <e> <s> that matter will worry juries and everyone else involved with the defence of public interest <e> <s> i see the case for a clause of that kind <e> <s> i am not at all sure how it will work in practice <e> <s> that will be one of the interesting matters which we shall be able to pursue if the bill gets a second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords so far the noble baroness has used the words wish and hope with regard to the future of the museums <e> <s> can she go a little further and say definitely that the museums will continue in existence <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness discussed the provisions of the important amendment amendment no and seemed to argue that they were all implicit in the bill already and therefore they were not necessary <e> <s> i notice that the governments attitude to amendments is a dichotomy <e> <s> an amendment is either a wrecking amendment if it disagrees with the government to a large extent or if it does not disagree to a large extent it is unnecessary because it is in the bill already <e> <s> this is what we have been treated to <e>", "<cs> if i heard the noble baroness aright she told us that the orders that are made such as those establishing the council and the national curriculum are subject to the authority of parliament <e> <s> can she tell me where that is said in the bill <e> <s> it is a large bill and i may quite easily have overlooked this it may be tucked away somewhere <e> <s> i think there are in clauses and descriptions of certain procedures which the secretary of state has to go through before he makes orders <e> <s> but nothing is said about when the orders are to be presented to parliament or whether they are to be subject to the affirmative or negative procedure in parliament <e> <s> i think we ought to know this <e> <s> it may be my own fault and that i have failed to spot something in the bill but i have looked for it and have not found it <e>", "<cs> i was afraid it might be something like that <e> <s> clause is right at the end on page where it says <e>", "<cs> when we wish to move amendments this side of the chamber is always told that they are either too big in which case they are wrecking or too small in which case they are not worth proposing <e> <s> if i understood the noble lord lord beloff aright he felt that i had not gone far enough and that logically i should go further <e> <s> the matter of good race relations is a considerable problem <e> <s> it cannot be solved solely by educational policy <e> <s> i never supposed that it could <e> <s> i was not attempting to do that this time <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has not explained why the introduction of grant-maintained schools should make it possible to improve educational standards <e> <s> my noble friend lady david pointed out that such schools must go without a number of the services they now receive from the local authority or must buy them in from elsewhere <e> <s> that would be a more expensive process for them and it would increase the cost of the educational provision over the country as a whole <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the reason we now have an amendment asking that a look be taken at what is proposed for ilea and that we consider it at this stage is because the government in their handling of this matter so far have rushed ahead without ever looking before they leapt <e> <s> the noble baroness said that the reason for the sudden change from what was originally proposed to a proposal for the outright abolition of ilea was due to a surge of opinion demanding it <e> <s> she knows very well that there was no such thing <e> <s> there has never been any surge of opinion demanding the abolition of ilea <e> <s> over and over again the issue has been before the citizens and parents of inner london and they have repeatedly shown their dislike of abolishing ilea <e>", "<cs> the minister drew our attention to the document published by wandsworth council and the fact that it contained a section entitled adult education <e> <s> however has she noticed that one of its recommendations is that fees charged in evening institutes should be increased <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord cledwyn may feel fully justified in having raised this subject before the house this evening <e> <s> indeed in this house debated the question whether britain should accept the mandate for palestine and decided by a vote of votes to that it would be better not to do so <e> <s> governments did not pursue that line of thought <e> <s> it is idle now to bewail that <e> <s> here it is and here we are as well as other protagonists in the struggle <e>", "<cs> i am by no means as well-versed in the complexities of this bill as most noble lords but i have been listening to this debate with increasing disquiet and amazement <e> <s> if i have got it right it seems to me that the chief finance officer will be able to say to the local authority which employs him i consider that in order to do my job properly i require an office of a certain size a certain number of staff with such and such qualifications and a certain amount of equipment <e> <s> when he has said that the local authority is legally obliged to provide it <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i should apologise for raising an issue which is only a point of detail as compared with the great pronouncements of principle to which we have listened with so much interest and admiration <e> <s> however i believe that it is an important point of detail <e> <s> i want to see schools having a collective act of worship <e> <s> i want it to be one which will not cause anyone to feel excluded and thrust into a corner neither so colourless as to dissatisfy many of those who take part in it <e>", "<cs> my lords one thing has been forgotten by noble lords who criticise this amendment <e> <s> the noble and learned lord said that he was impartial and consistent <e> <s> no doubt he is consistent but what he means by impartial will defy any range of definition <e>", "<cs> my lords in fact the noble and learned lord was wrong at every point <e> <s> has he asked himself why there should be amendments of this kind <e> <s> it is because there have been certain important changes in the world since the last great education act <e> <s> we have become much more aware of the fact that we live in one world that the actions of one nation can affect the rest of us <e> <s> that is truer now than it was in <e> <s> we have also become more aware of the dangers of the way in which we are devouring the resources of this planet <e>", "<cs> my lords i notice that the noble baroness seems anxious to rise <e> <s> before she gets up to say no perhaps i may be allowed to say a few words in support of the noble lord who so ably and persuasively moved the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords he has not become a member of the present government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not very happy with what the noble baroness has said but i doubt whether i shall get anything better by pressing the matter further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister rises perhaps i may put this question to her <e> <s> if there are two households one consisting of father mother and child and the other of a widow with three children is it just that in the first household there should be two votes and that in the second household the widow should have only one vote although she has three children <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what has been said by the noble lord lord thorneycroft i hope i may be forgiven if i make again a point which i made in an earlier debate <e> <s> i do so because it is an important point and i was quite unable to get the government to understand it at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the government will agree that this bill has provoked a good deal of controversy <e> <s> however they now have an opportunity of putting something in the bill which will be universally acclaimed and which may prove with the passage of time to be the thing for which this bill is chiefly remembered <e> <s> it is indeed remarkable that adult education should have remained a purely permissive concept for so long in our educational history <e> <s> i should just like to add the following arguments to the many which have already been advanced in this connection <e>", "<cs> my lords it really is cool on the part of the noble baroness lady young to criticise the noble lord lord alport for bringing up this matter at this time <e> <s> whose doing is it that the matter is being raised at this time <e> <s> who put this whole project into the bill unexpectedly breaking up the whole programme and timetable of the bill first in another place and then here <e>", "<cs> it is the government that are responsible for this situation all the way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness was producing that quotation from somebody else with a great deal of relish as all of us who heard her know very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the right reverend prelate for the attention he has given to a point i raised in earlier debates on this matter <e> <s> i am very glad to see that the formulae put before us now will make it possible for the arrangements which i described in order to meet the problems of schools with students of different faiths to be lawful <e> <s> i am grateful to everyone who has contributed to that end <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i thought that the noble viscount made a comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot allow myself to be persuaded by the arguments of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> towards the end of his speech he seemed to reach the point of saying that the less legal parliamentary control there was the more actual control there would be <e> <s> he argued that if you did not have the duty either to get an affirmative resolution or to pray against orders there would be so much fuss made in parliament that you would actually lose by having to go through either the affirmative or negative procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just finish this point <e> <s> i was left feeling that if all that is true why has parliament bothered to provide for affirmative or negative procedures at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the argument now advanced is that parliament has felt that you must look at the importance of the matter and that helps you to decide whether you have <e>", "<cs> that helps to decide whether you have the affirmative or the negative procedure or indeed no procedure at all <e> <s> i tried to make the point with regard to each of these amendments that they are matters of public importance <e> <s> it is true as the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness who has just spoken raised the question of this very odd name a college of technology and its application to the performing and creative arts not a college studying the performing and creative arts nor a college apparently studying technology but a college devoted to the study of the application of technology to the performing and creative arts <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the noble baroness has put forward a very pleasant and plausible defence of the bill <e> <s> i admit at once that there are certain things that the bill has achieved about which the house may rejoice the improvements made in tackling the problems facing children with special needs and what i think may prove to be a durable settlement of the religious question in schools <e>", "<cs> i am not a lawyer nor a parliamentary draftsman although as suggested one may regard that as a matter either for disappointment or congratulation <e> <s> a very witty member of this house the late lord hale had also been a member of the other place <e> <s> once in a speech there he remarked my honourable friends spend half their time making ill-natured remarks about lawyers and the other half asking me for unpaid advice <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls has urged us to wait for the regulations <e> <s> however he will have heard it argued in this place as the rest of us have that this place is not entitled to say no to regulations or other secondary legislation which has been approved by the other place <e> <s> that is a disputed point but if that view is correct proposals that we can have another go because the matter will come before us in regulations are worthless because the point will have been decided before the regulations arrive here <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the denial of human rights to many of the kurdish people and the use of chemical weapons has that matter not become one of universal international importance <e> <s> are the government going to take any action at the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble viscount noted that all the remarks made so far have been either critically questioning or downright hostile and that no spark of enthusiasm has been aroused in any part of the house <e> <s> will he make that clear to his ministerial colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords at the beginning of a new session of parliament in time past the sovereign opened the gracious speech from the throne with the words <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an extremely interesting debate <e> <s> whether it went on the lines that the noble lord lord jenkins intended when he set out the words that described it i do not know but i cannot honestly believe that he thought that this house would spend the whole afternoon debating the methods of foreign policy and not the content of it <e> <s> it was inevitable that the debate would go as it has with considerable excusions into the substance of foreign policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my gratitude to those noble lords who have taken part in the debate and to those who have attended it <e> <s> i hope that the debate has been useful to the government and that we shall see results i believe the term is in due course <e> <s> i believe that a table ought to be published indicating what is the precise degree of urgency of the phrases in due course shortly at the next opportunity and not this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i concur with previous speakers in expressing appreciation of the action of the noble lord lord home in initiating this debate <e> <s> the debate is described as being chiefly concerned with the power and unity of the western alliance <e> <s> i sometimes feel that we have moved away from that to every part of the globe <e> <s> i wish to stress again that it is the unity and power of the western alliance that is in question <e> <s> i must say that i agree with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that one of the most important features of the alliance is that it has at last ensured that if the democracies of western europe are in danger the united states is their ally <e> <s> so much would have been saved if that had been true in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that there is anyone in the house who can speak with greater authority on the affairs of hong kong than the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> i am sure that the government will pay great attention to what he said <e> <s> i shall not attempt to follow him into that subject which requires a special knowledge which few of us possess <e>"]
