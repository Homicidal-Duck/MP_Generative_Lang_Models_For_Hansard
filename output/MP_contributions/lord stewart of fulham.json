["<cs> with respect to the minister i do not think she has so far made a convincing case against the amendment <e> <s> if we look first at the immediate issue it can be defined in this way as things now stand the secretary of state has to approve the articles of government for secondary schools but will not have to approve the articles of government as they will now be called for primary schools <e> <s> why is that distinction being made <e> <s> the minister pointed out that throughout the bill there runs the question how much freedom should he given to local authorities and what matters should come <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i agree that we shall have an opportunity for fuller discussion on the duties of governors on the later amendments <e> <s> at this stage i am only making a few preliminary remarks <e> <s> it seems to arise on this clause because the articles of government will presumably give some idea about the duties of governors <e> <s> the government are standing by the proposition that where a secondary school is concerned this formulation of the duties of governors is a matter that the secretary of state ought to have under review whereas for primary schools the secretary of state apparently is not interested <e> <s> that raises the question how important are the articles of government and how important is it to get some idea of what governors do <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble lord opposite and to my noble friend lady phillips <e> <s> weighing everything up i do not wish to press this amendment <e>", "<cs> i found that it was rather difficult to follow some of the arguments advanced against this amendment <e> <s> it does not say or even suggest that the governors have got to be members of the local education authority <e> <s> if i understood the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill aright he argued that if this amendment were carried nobody would want to be a governor unless he were a member of the local education authority <e> <s> if that was not what the noble lord meant he was certainly arguing that the result of this amendment would be that people would have to be governors of large numbers of schools <e> <s> there is not the slightest necessity for that <e> <s> the local education authority can choose people to be governors of schools without loading on to each one of them that they must be governors of more than one school and experience shows that that is so <e>", "<cs> well i defer to my noble friend but i think he will agree that it was a near thing <e> <s> however i believe that the responsibility lies with the local authority and that its representatives therefore ought not to be outnumbered <e> <s> that is really what we are discussing in this amendment and we ought not to be put off by the suggestion that it is a necessary part of this amendment that one man or one woman should be a governor of schools <e> <s> there is not the least necessity for that it is a complete red herring <e> <s> therefore i invite the committee to consider what is really involved in this amendment the real principle of democracy and the fact that the local authority who in the end will have to carry the can should not be outnumbered on the governing body <e>", "<cs> after listening to the noble lord lord james i do suggest that there is a large educational world beyond his experience perhaps a less happy educational world than the one he knows <e> <s> we all know that headmasters can have a considerable influence <e> <s> i remember once going to a meeting in the palace of westminster which was to be addressed by the headmaster of eton <e> <s> for some reason most of the people coming were a little late and it was very interesting to notice how even in late middle age they were scurrying along the corridor at the thought of being late for a meeting addressed by a headmaster <e> <s> in many state schools it really is not quite like that and it is no good our discussing whether it ought to be <e> <s> the governors particularly when you go to all this trouble to appoint them expect to have some influence about how the school is run <e>", "<cs> i hope that i may be forgiven for not quite understanding that the noble lord was supporting me <e> <s> however as it is the wish of my noble friends to press this amendment to a vote we shall see for certain <e>", "<cs> the government arc being implored in all quarters of the committee to accept the amendment and i really feel they should <e> <s> on the question of enforceability my noble friend lady wootton of abinger pointed out that it has been considered for a long time to he useful to put what i would call clauses of exhortation into a bill they are a reminder <e> <s> it might happen that a local authority behaved in a slovenly fashion over its appointment of governors and paid no attention to the kind of thing mentioned in this proposal <e> <s> if on the other hand the amendment were in the bill the secretary of state would then have a solid ground on which to tell them to think again <e> <s> without this provision he could not do that and it is a well-known principle of law that if there is in a statute something which advises against a particular abuse it is likely to raise the general standard of behaviour <e> <s> not many local authorities would ignore all these things but the fact that if one of them did the secretary of state could act would i think act as a general stimulus to them <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord has referred to me so definitely i think that i should reply <e> <s> i have indeed long experience of debating with him and it has taught me that he is almost invariably wrong as indeed he is in this instance <e> <s> one of the grumbles from the government about our amendment is that it is too prescriptive though the noble baroness admitted that prescribe is too strong a word <e> <s> but amendments nos <e> <s> and are rather more prescriptive they would arouse greater hostility from the government <e> <s> when the noble lord speaks of our wasting our vote on this amendment does he imagine that we come here with only a certain number of votes available <e> <s> if the noble lord really prefers amendments nos <e> <s> and i trust that if we are defeated and noble lords on the liberal benches press their proposal to a vote we shall then see the noble lord putting his feet where his mouth is <e>", "<cs> i follow a great deal of the ministers remarks but i am puzzled about one matter <e> <s> i can see the secretary of state approving the instrument of government but i cannot see him scrutinising the list of governors in each school and being aware that the child of one of them had left that school six or months earlier <e> <s> will it be possible for the secretary of state by his own action to determine that a governor does not go on being a governor long after his child has left the school <e> <s> the minister asks my noble friend lady david not to press the amendment on the ground that the secretary of state will take care of the <e>", "<cs> i am greatly obliged to the noble baroness and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble baroness <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i want to say only a few words <e> <s> there is always the possibility that the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls may arrive while i am saying them <e> <s> the government are being most tiresome and really pernickety about this <e> <s> lord bellwins first objection to amendment no <e> <s> was that it was defective <e> <s> apparently it was defective because the words and in it were unnecessary <e> <s> being equally pernickety myself i should have thought that made it excessive rather than defective <e> <s> it certainly was not defective in the legal sense because the presence of those unnecessary words would not have invalidated the effect of the rest of the amendment <e> <s> that has been the level of the governments comment <e> <s> but on the serious issue surely the position is this <e>", "<cs> the committee will hardly be surprised if i say that i agree with my noble friend lady stewart of alvechurch <e> <s> i have been doing so for some time <e> <s> may i first refer to the points raised by the noble baroness <e> <s> the amendment would leave it for the pupils themselves to decide which pupils would be chosen and of course they could not compel a pupil who said i am too busy <e> <s> i have my work to do <e> <s> i think you would find that the pupils chosen would be those who could take it on and i think they would do it well <e>", "<cs> i must reply to that <e> <s> in the various educational experiences i have had i have never been a headmaster and the difficulty i have had with headmasters all my life is to get them to listen to what one is actually saying <e> <s> the point i was arguing was this i thought it was plain enough <e> <s> the old public school prefectorial system was designed to support an imperialist aristocratic society and in that context it did what it was intended to do <e> <s> i am pointing out that today we do not live in that kind of society but we have the same problem of getting the co-operation of young people in making the kind of society we live in work well <e>", "<cs> can the noble baroness give me an indication of how long it will take and would it be fair to assume that within a year of the passage of the act this provision would apply to all schools <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble baroness <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness made a criticism of the drafting of the amendment <e> <s> i must say that the government are very hard to <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the government are going to ask for raw exam results <e> <s> all i am saying is that if they do that then they ought to do this as well <e>", "<cs> from the reply she has given it is quite clear that in some form or other the noble baroness wants the examination results published and also she is quite definite that she does not want the information mentioned in this amendment published <e>", "<cs> that makes the refusal of the noble baroness all the more remarkable <e> <s> it means that schools are to publish information by virtue of which they might be judged without the very important qualification that the public ought to know before they can reach a decision <e> <s> we are told in fact that the parents would not be bright enough to understand this information <e> <s> if that is the attitude that is going to be taken why publish information at all <e> <s> exactly the same objection can be raised to the publication of examination results <e> <s> if as the noble baroness alleges this information is already available then it ought to be included in what she is going to require <e> <s> to require them to publish their examination results and not to require them to say whether they are spending more per child in one kind of school than in another is a fraud <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady young has raised objection to this amendment on the ground that it puts two conflicting sets of duties on local authorities those under this legislation and those under the act <e> <s> surely it would be easy to include in the repeals schedule of the bill repeal of the relevant sections of the act <e> <s> the conflict between the two sets of duties would then be resolved <e>", "<cs> we have not moved the amendments that we had in mind for this clause but there are one or two matters that i should like to raise and i hope that the government will bear them in mind and perhaps be able to do something about them at the report stage <e>", "<cs> i believe that the minister was suggesting to us that since clause requires the secretary of states approval for the closing of nursery schools he was conferring on nursery education a great benefit <e>", "<cs> a great advance that it had not had before <e> <s> but this is done in the context of a bill clause of which no longer makes it a duty of local authorities to provide nursery education at all <e> <s> so what has happened is that in clause the government have poured a steady torrent of discouragement on nursery education by making it no longer a duty of local authorities <e> <s> the minister now tells us that in clause the government have provided a modest umbrella against that torrent <e> <s> we are now pointing out to the noble lord that there is a large hole in this umbrella and we are suggesting that that at least might be rectified <e>", "<cs> yes but i have a suspicion that by that time the cost of an average secondary school pupil will be rather higher than and i do not think they will cater for pupils on million <e> <s> so we are in a little of a fog as to quite how many children and how much money will ultimately be involved in this scheme <e>", "<cs> i do not think i was ever very keen on that myself i must say but as the noble lord knows it has always been argued that that was a special case <e> <s> i am myself very doubtful of itbut even if one accepts the principle and accept it unwillingly i do not wish to see it extended <e> <s> i think it is a bad principle <e> <s> as say the noble baroness may be able to assure me that i am all wrong and that they are not going t spend more than <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> should like to deal first with what seems to me the one argument of substance advanced in favour of this scheme which can be put thus there are only a limited number of people who can teach certain subjects chemistry was mentioned particularly but there are other subjects to which it applies and there are only a limited number of people who can teach these subjects really well <e> <s> unless therefore we have an assisted places scheme a number of bright children will fail to get the teaching they need <e>", "<cs> yes i understand that boarding fees are not included but does that mean that a boarding school could not be a participating school <e>", "<cs> i notice that it is not said explicitly in the bill that no boarding schools will participate and that is rather important <e>", "<cs> if boarding schools participate this is just <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has always had a habit of turning what was said into something rather different <e> <s> he makes a very telling reply destroying what he represents as having been said <e> <s> i am not suggesting that they always took little yes-men but i quite certainly say that neither the direct <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the arguments that have been advanced during this debate in favour of the governments clause <e> <s> it seems to me that they can be summarised under three heads with the resounding slogan equity liberty and economy <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has put her finger on the point that i am seeking to make <e> <s> are records of that kind educational within the meaning of the word educational here <e> <s> that is what we want to know <e>", "<cs> i should like to get this clear <e> <s> that means <e>", "<cs> with great respect i think that my noble riend is agreeing with me <e> <s> i am very much concerned and that is why i raised the amendment that these noneducational records to which my noble friend referred should not be bandied about <e> <s> want the safeguard that this clause would imply that the secretary of state can make regulations as to whether or not they should be disclosed <e> <s> the regulations cover the keeping disclosure and transfer of the records <e> <s> if my amendment is accepted the secretary of state would be able to lay it down that confidentiality must be observed about these records <e> <s> if the word educational stays in apparently he could not give any ruling or instruction <e> <s> if a local authority chose to be careless about it there is nothing the secretary of state could do <e> <s> i am more disquieted the more this argument proceeds <e>", "<cs> we are in the odd position that apparently the local authorities are to be trusted completely regarding the confidentiality of non-educational records which may well be of a highly confidential character but apparently are not to be trusted with such information as what marks the child received at the last school examinations <e> <s> it seems very odd that the secretary of state should have power to direct them <e>", "<cs> i should like to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does not seem to have any sense of answering an argument <e> <s> he just reads us a set piece each time <e> <s> i am reminded of the story of an american <e>"]
