stability in the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords i under <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for those kind words <e> <s> the government support the proposal for a conference on

confidence-building measures applying to the whole of europe from the atlantic to the urals <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have explained to the noble baroness on several occasions the solution to this problem lies elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords in my statement to your lordships on th december i stressed that her majestys government were extremely concerned about the damagingly sharp rise in the import of textiles from the united states <e> <s> i am happy to say that on the following day my honourable friend the minister for trade secured the unanimous agreement of the council of ministers of the european communities that a new and urgent initiative was needed <e> <s> the commission was accordingly invited to pursue discussions with the united states administration over the whole range of problems and possible solutions and to report back to the council as early as possible with a first report in february <e>", "<cs> my lords the united nations general assembly has just adopted a resolution urging the committee on disarmament to continue negotiations on a chemical weapons convention as a matter of high priority <e> <s> we supported this resolution <e> <s> the government remain

comparable to that in afghanistan or poland where there is direct or the threat of direct intervention by soviet troops <e> <s> we would of course like the people of el salvador to be able to determine their own future peacefully and democratically <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the noble baroness is referring to the undertakings given by my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state in another place on th january to the effect that i would give careful consideration to a number of points regarding aviation security <e> <s> i shall indeed consider them carefully but i do not propose to make a report <e>", "<cs> my lords the government expect the board of british airways to improve efficiency in the use of capital and labour resources to match the level of its most efficient competitors and to attain a level of profitability consistent with the financial target that we have set for the airline <e>", "<cs> my lords the government view the french proposal as an interesting one <e> <s> we look forward to the report of the united nations group of experts which has been attempting to work out the details of such a scheme including costs <e>",

states treatment similar to that accorded to the acp countries under the terms of the second lom convention <e> <s> while welcome the benefits accruing from these arrangements are unlikely to have a major impact on the falklands economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the bill deals with a number of separate but important matters in the field of company law <e> <s> it implements a european community directive on company accounts <e> <s> it changes the law on the registration of company and business names <e> <s> it reinforces the company inspection system and the legal sanctions against fraud and misbehaviour <e> <s> it includes a number of modest but valuable reforms of company law <e> <s> the origins of these varied strands are very different it is perhaps characteristic of companies bills that they deal with a number of apparently disparate issues in the field of company law <e> <s> but underlying the provisions of this bill are certain themes themes which are characteristic of this governments overall policies their commitment to help small firms to eliminate unnecessary administrative burdens on companies to streamline their own administration to strengthen the weapons available to counter crime and misconduct <e> <s> the bill makes significant contributions within the field of company law to each of these broad policy objectives and it is against those objectives that the government are happy to be judged <e> <s> this is particularly the case with a bill which appears as this one does to contain a mass of technical and apparently complex provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords if as i <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said on many occasions we believe that the problem would largely disappear if legitimate low fares were accepted by our international partners <e> <s> we have been making some progress and will continue to take all reasonable steps to that end <e>", "<cs> my lords the united nations and the voluntary organisations concerned are co-operating closely in the organisation of relief for those suffering in the horn of africa <e> <s> recent publicity over the supply of food for karamoja has obscured the remarkable achievement of all concerned in saving three-quarters of a million people from starvation <e> <s> ministers have discussed co-ordination of current relief work with the administrator of the united nations development programme <e> <s> co-ordination of humanitarian assistance in general will be considered by the economic and social council in july <e>", "<cs> my lords

again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords all concerned in the negotiations including the new administration in the united states are reviewing their approach in the light of the setback to hopes of an early settlement at the geneva meeting in january <e> <s> we hope that negotiations will resume soon but it is too early to predict when or how it may be possible to make progress <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset may i say that i am a little croaky this evening and if i finally give up halfway through my speech my noble friend lord avon has kindly agreed to take over though i hope that that will not be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords matters relating to the method of sale of airline tickets are for discussion in the first place between the airlines and their agents

measures in the fields of european security human rights freedom of movement information and family reunification <e>", "<cs> my lords we warmly welcomed president shagari on his state visit <e> <s> my right honourable friend the prime minister had extremely valuable and constructive discussions with him covering african problems especially namibia as well as other international and bilateral

before i answer this question may i say that my noble friend lord soames had intended to answer this question himself and indeed the following one but he is unfortunately indisposed and therefore unable to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the latest public expenditure white paper cmnd <e> <s> shows that net overseas aid rose by about per cent <e> <s> in real terms between and and that it will decline by per cent <e> <s> between and the current financial year reflecting the governments planned reductions in this sector <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom along with most other western countries abstained on this resolution <e> <s> the result of the vote in plenary was votes in favour with abstentions <e>", "<cs> my lords as a result of the tax allowances provided in the finance act and other action taken by the government i am pleased to say that the availability of small industrial workshops is improving to meet continuing demand and the number now being built is greater than for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords this as was to be expected has been an important and interesting debate <e> <s> it has been concerned with the future for this bill is designed to open the way to opportunities which as a nation we cannot afford to let slip <e> <s> nobody can forecast these opportunities in detail at the present time and therefore the bill is bound to be permissive and open-ended rather than restrictive and minutely prescriptive <e> <s> it gives the secretary of state the powers to respond to changes as they occur in a field which is likely to see changes over the coming years greater perhaps than any other <e> <s> we have heard about a number of products and services for which the technology is already known and available <e> <s> what is needed is the spur of competition and the freedom for british companies to go out and meet the demand for new services from businessmen and consumers <e> <s> this is why this is an exciting bill and one which points the way to innovation and growth and so to creating <e>", "<cs> my lords todays debate has once again been both timely and useful <e> <s> as it has shown any discussion on the newspaper industry raises issues and principles which lie at the very heart of our society <e> <s> it is therefore most appropriate that your lordships should debate the industry from time to time and we are indeed indebted to my noble friend lord birdwood as every noble lord has said for giving us the opportunity to do so today <e> <s> the debate provides a fitting opportunity for me to express my great regret at the recent untimely death of lord barnetson <e> <s> a lifetimes experience in the newspaper world enabled him to speak with authority on many aspects of the press <e> <s> he will be greatly missed by his colleagues in the industry and doubtless he would have taken part in this debate today had he still been alive <e>", "<cs> my lords it is extremely difficult to measure the non-price competitiveness of goods <e> <s> however i believe that united kingdom manufacturing industry is in fact improving its performance in this area and certainly the fact that design quality marketing delivery and after-sales service are vitally important in gaining and maintaining export markets is one which is now much more widely understood <e>", "<cs> my lords intercommunal talks under the auspices of the secretary-general of the united nations are continuing in nicosia and the recent progress made on missing persons is encouraging <e> <s> the government will continue to support the united nations efforts to reach a just settlement through the talks <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the government of lebanon are urgently seeking a political settlement of the present crisis <e> <s> we believe the role of the international community should be to support them in these endeavours and to uphold the authority of the legitimate government <e> <s> the lebanese government have not asked for the security councils assistance <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we continue to provide our share of support to the international bodies concerned with population work <e> <s> we are also very ready to respond to the priorities expressed by recipient countries in the allocation of our bilateral aid <e> <s> in india for example we are financing a family welfare project in the state of orissa which includes family planning and population education elements <e>", "<cs> my lords during his visit the romanian prime minister discussed trade matters with my right honourable friends the prime minister

offering particularly good opportunities for industrial co-operation were identified these included the energy and aviation fields <e> <s> in addition representatives from a number of british companies were able to meet the romanian prime minister <e> <s> particular opportunities discussed during the visit will be followed up with the firms concerned <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend is saying in proposing this amendment that if in this bill we are separating the two businesses of posts and telecommunications then it should not be necessary for one to continue to perform services for the other <e> <s> however i must disagree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords a statement will be made as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords while the government consider that a political solution to the conflict in el salvador is desirable the precise means of achieving this is a matter for the parties in el salvador to agree <e> <s> her majestys government do not consider

alexandria in the course of the summer <e> <s> no decision has been taken to close it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in answer to a question by the noble baroness on th march it is for the agents to discuss with the airlines matters relating to methods of sale of airline tickets <e> <s> there is no action for the government to take until such time as the airlines are persuaded to favour a system of wholesaling of unsold tickets and there is an iata recommendation to this effect for governments to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any widely published abuses involving british aid <e> <s> if my noble friend knows of any i hope he will send me the full particulars so that they can be thoroughly looked into <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i have received evidence but none of it

which i am circulating in the <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government regret the continuing violence in lebanon and the tragic loss of life that has gone with it <e> <s> we believe the british governments role and that of other governments should be to support the legitimate government of lebanon and not individual groups within the country <e> <s> the lebanese government has been working for a reconciliation between the parties <e> <s> this provides the best assurance for the security of the people of lebanon christian and moslem alike <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the prime minister discussed afghanistan with the soviet ambassador on th march <e> <s> there have been subsequent exchanges in moscow <e> <s> the government have made it clear that we expect the soviet union to withdraw their troops from afghanistan and leave the afghan people free to determine their own future <e> <s> no satisfactory response has been obtained <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend the foreign secretary met the spanish foreign minister in brussels on th march he was assured of the spanish governments continuing commitment to the agreement of th april which provided for the restoration of direct communications between gibraltar and spain and the opening of negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords the legal provisions are contained in sections and of the civil aviation act in so far as british operators and their agents are concerned and in article of the air navigation order in so far as foreign operators are concerned <e> <s> in both cases the offence relates to the carriage of passengers or cargo in contravention of the operators operating licence or permit <e>", "<cs> my lords under the terms of the continental shelf convention of and the applicable rules of international law the united kingdom has exclusive jurisdiction over the exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf areas adjacent to the falkland islands <e> <s> certain powers to

regulations of <e>", "<cs> my lords a better legal framework might make it easier to mount a successful prosecution but it would not deal with the problem of discounted air tickets <e> <s> as i have said so often both inside and outside your lordships house we shall see a reduction in discounting only when as on the north atlantic the airlines can compete freely over fares <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the act provides a new stimulus to competition and efficiency in both the public and private sectors <e> <s> a total of seven investigations under the new powers have so far been launched four concerning possible anti-competitive practices and three concerning efficiency in public sector industries <e> <s> further investigations will be made where appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the civil aviation authority plan to instal an aerodrome surface surveillance radar at gatwick on the new visual control room which they hope to open in spring <e> <s> i understand that the new visual control room will provide a good site for this kind of equipment which will assist the safe and expeditious movement of traffic at night and at other times when visibility is low <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from the civil aviation authority that air traffic control clearance was given for low flying over wimbledon last tuesday <e> <s> the authority granted an operators request for an exemption from rule <e>", "<cs> my lords one thing which has come through from the debate this evening and from representations which have been made to me in the past is that the discounting of air fares is widely disliked <e> <s> the airlines do not like it although most if not all of them are involved in it because it erodes their profits and this at a time when most of them are losing money <e> <s> the authorised travel agents do not like it because they are losing customers to agents who in some cases are less scrupulous and perhaps not so mindful of their customers interest <e> <s> we all regret a practice which erodes respect for the law <e> <s> even the customer who is glad enough to buy a cheap ticket has some qualms about doing business with a bucket shop suspecting that the transaction in which he is involved may not be completely above board <e> <s> there is no doubt that he the customer would much prefer a range of low fares to be made available on a wholly legitimate basis <e>", "<cs> my lords this is very much an issue which arouses deep emotions and rightly and understandably so <e> <s> i am sure that when islanders read the record of what has been said today they will be gratified by the support they have been given <e> <s> it is important that this dispute and the islanders situation should be understood as widely as possible to ensure that their interests are safeguarded and their wishes respected <e> <s> this is at the root of the governments policy <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government and some other western creditors have received a request from the government of poland for some additional short-term financial assistance in addition to the debt rescheduling and new commercial credits which we have already provided <e> <s> we and our partners are giving consideration to this request <e>", "<cs> my lords the ambassador and his staff in the united states are making every effort to explain our policy and to counter malicious or ill-informed reports about northern ireland by many methods including television and radio appearances letters to the press and personal briefings <e> <s> a number of ministers members of parliament and senior officials have also visited the united states to put our own point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i will repeat a statement being made in the other place by my honourable friend the minister for consumer affairs <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be appropriate to publish confidential correspondence exchanged with the governor of gibraltar <e> <s> the memorandum which expressed the views of both the chief minister and the opposition leaders in gibraltar has been considered most carefully <e>", "<cs> i shall first deal with the wider implications of my noble friends amendment and then come to the specific matter he has raised <e> <s> the amendment would enable a british citizen by descent to transmit his citizenship automatically to his child born overseas if at the time of the childs birth he was in crown service under the government of a dependency and had been recruited for such service in the united kingdom <e> <s> the first generation born overseas of course automatically acquires british citizenship under the provisions of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the
