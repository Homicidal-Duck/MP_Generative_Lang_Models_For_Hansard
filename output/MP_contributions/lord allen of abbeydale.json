["<cs> my lords i am rather relieved that my name appears fairly high up on the list of those who are speaking in this debate because i feel that if it came very much lower down all the points that i was thinking about would already have been taken <e> <s> but we must all of us be grateful to the noble lord lord soper for giving us this opportunity of discussing while we are waiting for the may committee report some aspects of what is one of our most baffling social problems bedevilled as it is not surprisingly by a perpetual and continual lack of resources <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to the areas which are covered but am i right in thinking that the actual places so far available come out at less than <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl said in introducing this interesting bill it is often said that those who are interested in questions of crime and punishment tend to forget about the victims of crime <e> <s> i do not in fact think that that is true but the noble earl certainly continues to deserve our thanks for giving us this further opportunity of talking about this topic following the debate he introduced rather less than a year ago <e> <s> i fear that like the noble lord lord boston i do not go along with the noble earl when he says that hardly anything has been done in this country to help victims of crime <e> <s> i believe that this country does rather more than most to provide help for victims of crime although certainly no one would for a moment claim that we have achieved perfection or anything like it <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected on that point but it is news to me that a scottish provision could go as far as to cover a sisters illegitimate child or an aunts stepson <e> <s> however these are comparatively detailed points which we can leave aside for the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with some diffidence at this stage of the debate but having totted up the number of speakers who have spoken in favour of the bill it is perhaps time for a voice to be heard briefly expressing a rather different view <e> <s> may i begin by saying that for reasons of which the noble lord lord wade is aware i was unable to be present for the first part of his speech and to my regret i missed the comments which i understand he was kind enough to make about the select committee <e> <s> this was indeed a fascinating and as i found it educative experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it is nice to have a judicial ruling so promptly <e> <s> there are a number of other points most of them discussed by the select committee which make me wonder whether this short bill if it is to go ahead does go quite far enough <e> <s> if i may mention them briefly it seems to me that they are rather more than being cosmetic amendments suitable to be raised only at the committee stage <e> <s> the first point is that the select committee thought that the convention ought to be set out in full in the bill and although i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all extremely grateful to the minister for being so forthcoming and for giving us so much information <e> <s> in particular i noted with great interest what he said about encouraging industry to start thinking about these problems perhaps even more deeply than hitherto as well as what he said about the governments present attitude to the defence of development risks <e> <s> we were all glad to know what was the likely programme at brussels and i noted with great interest what i understood the minister to say that any question of signing the strasbourg convention is put off <e>", "<cs> my lords following the remarks of the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that informative reply may i ask him whether he accepts that the achievement so far that is the possibility of places by the end of this year out of a <e>", "<cs> my lords when the home secretary made his statement on th april about the may committee report on prisons he said that the social services secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite a thought that since the first attempt to debate this question some two months ago something like prisoners unconvicted or unsentenced must have been received into the prisons of england and wales <e> <s> it is an even more solemn thought to think that there must have been several hundred who at that date in april were awaiting their trial or their sentence and who are still in prison still waiting <e> <s> it is thoughts of this kind which underline to my mind the significance for the liberty of the subject of the question which the noble lord lord hutchinson is asking tonight <e> <s> i am grateful to him for giving us the opportunity of commenting on it <e> <s> perhaps i could begin by assuring him that officials as well as ministers are gravely concerned and have been gravely concerned for some time about these problems <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point to which i hope to come a little later <e> <s> but they are not my figures i claim no credit for them <e> <s> they are taken from an official publication <e> <s> although there has been a percentage fall they are a percentage of an increasing total and certainly there is not the slightest ground for complacency <e>", "<cs> my lords i refrained from interrupting the noble earl earlier when he talked about my speech as being optimistic <e> <s> i was merely presenting a few historical facts to demonstrate that there were a few chinks of light in the general gloom <e> <s> i certainly said nothing to dissent from the conclusion that it is a scandal which ought to he dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to bring the house back to earth and i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that reply which falls some way short of the ideal may i ask if he is aware that the royal commission estimated that there were some children suffering from severe mental or physical handicap that the strain on the family was immense and that the royal commission were unanimous in thinking that a substantial gap remained after taking account of all the existing forms of support <e> <s> is there any possibility of the government thinking further about the principle involved in a compassionate society such as ours <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my thanks to the select committee and to the clear exposition we had from its chairman the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton <e> <s> this is a very important topic <e> <s> we debated it about a year ago and no doubt we shall be debating it again in future novembers <e> <s> i spoke at what i now see was some length when we debated the matter last november and i certainly do not propose to say all over again what i said then but there are a few comments i wish to make speaking in the main as a member of the pearson royal commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to cause a further interruption but if the minister is leaving the state of the art defence can he say whether the decision means that we cannot accede to the strasbourg convention <e>", "<cs> my lords while i fully recognise the desirability of the much greater use of seat belts i will content myself at this stage of the debate and with the long list of speakers to follow by explaining quite briefly three reasons why i have some reservations about the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> i wonder whether he can explain why it is that the police who tell us they would have no difficulty in enforcing a compulsory seat belts law do nothing about this offence when the evidence is quite literally staring them in the face <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might press this a little further <e> <s> is there not some risk of underrating the importance of this matter <e> <s> would it not be a serious matter if someone were unfortunately knocked down by one of these vehicles and then could not read the number plate because it was illegally too small <e> <s> are there not good reasons why number plates should be visible at a distance and is there not good reason why the law should not be so openly flouted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply she will not be surprised if i find it a trifle disappointing may i ask whether it is still the policy of the government that there should be places in these units at any rate to start with <e> <s> and given the rate of progress since the butler committee made that recommendation seven years ago this month a recommendation which was accepted by the government of the day is it the thought that this first programme will be completed by the end of this decade or by the end of this century <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate that the numbers in the units both permanent and interim are still very small may i ask the minister to say whether any of those concerned come either from prison or from broadmoor or one of the other special hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord and in fact i am familiar with that quotation but is that an expression of what ought to happen or is it an account of what does actually happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> even if he does use the jargon state of the art <e> <s> the government came to what some of us regard as a regrettable decision to allow this defence of development risks which means that a victim would have no right to redress against the manufacturer in a thalidomide-type tragedy unless he could prove negligence which would be a formidable undertaking <e> <s> i am tempt d to ask whether the lack <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak very briefly in support of this amendment the attraction of which is to lessen the impact of the criminal law with all its problems of enforcement which still bother me very greatly and to return to a measure of individual decision in a way which would meet the argument that the costs of death and injury as a result of not wearing seat belts would be an extra burden on the community <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has had a no day named motion down on the order paper for many a long month about this report may i ask whether it is the governments intention to initiate a debate on the very wide-ranging recommendations in the report at an earlier rather than at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the long list of speakers i am proposing to limit myself to two points only <e> <s> in particular i am resisting the temptation at this stage to follow the noble lord lord elton in discussing the recent judgment of the european court of human rights and the noble baroness in what she said about mental handicap <e> <s> i would just make the point that i think it is risky to place too much confidence in the prospect of consolidation <e> <s> consolidation cannot make fundamental changes in the law <e> <s> i fear that it is basically cosmetic but there will be other opportunities to discuss that in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make it clear and remove the doubt that the figures i quoted were figures including administration and they were figures based on prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i will detain your lordships for only a few moments <e> <s> it has been an interesting debate <e> <s> at least we have had some reaction from the government which we are very glad to hear <e> <s> i am not sure that i have taken in everything that the noble lord lord bellwin said <e> <s> he did go at quite a rate <e> <s> i look forward to reading in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not for a moment underrate the problems we are discussing but i have been trying hard to discern some chinks of light in the gloom <e> <s> i suppose that is a natural reaction from somebody who has served for some years in her majestys treasury <e> <s> to begin with i detect an increasing awareness of the problems of overcrowding of outworn buildings and of prisoners being kept in unacceptable conditions and a wider appreciation than ever in the past of why something needs to be done <e> <s> the basic problems are not really new <e> <s> i recall <e> <s> there were then prisoners sleeping three in a cell but it was very difficult to persuade anyone to listen <e> <s> i must say that thanks largely to the policy of openness in recent years pursued by the much maligned home office there has been quite a change which is all to the good <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble minister for that reply i am bound to say i found it less encouraging than i had hoped <e> <s> the painfully slow progress of this programme going back over eight years or so is not one of the major glories of our island story <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether the sums he has referred to as being allotted this year will all be spent on these units and not diverted to other purposes as has happened in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords one is bound to have sympathy with the underlying purpose of this draft directive and to acknowledge notwithstanding what we have just heard that there is quite considerable room for improvement in this country <e> <s> but as the report of the committee says the draft seems to be somewhat over-rigid and for my part i should like to comment quite briefly on two aspects where i think there is a risk of the bureaucracy simply overdoing it <e> <s> i speak as a bureaucrat of some years standing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble and learned lord for that informative reply may i ask him whether he is aware that i heard the organisers of the falklands appeal speaking on the radio as though it were a charity and is he further aware that the government stated on th may that the south atlantic appeal would not be a charity <e> <s> if the government themselves find it difficult to get it right and the public are left in some confusion does not this lend some force to the argument which some of us have been propounding that the time has come to take a fresh look at the law on charities <e>", "<cs> my lords minutes is a very short time in which to do justice to a complicated and important issue like this <e> <s> i am sure that the house and indeed the whole community must be grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for raising this question at this time <e> <s> we have already heard a good deal and no doubt will hear a good deal more about the problems set by the restrictions imposed by this act of the per cent <e> <s> test for disability and so forth and the doubts as to whether it is really contributing to one of its main objectives i assume it was one of its main objectives to try and increase the proportion of children who undergo vaccination against various ills <e> <s> so far as the medical tribunals are concerned to which the noble lord lord campbell and the noble lord lord mishcon have referred i do not know if it is the intention to use the regulation-making power under the act in effect to apply the adjudication changes contemplated in part viii of the health and social services and social security adjudications bill dear me i hope i got it right <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak in this debate with very considerable diffidence when i look at the expertise of the other members of your lordships house who have put down their names to contribute because i can certainly claim no expert knowledge <e> <s> however as a member of sub-committee c i found the subject a fascinating one and i should like to pay my tribute to the way in which my noble friend lord seebohm guided us through our deliberations of what is really a rather complicated matter and to the way in which he has so succinctly put the main considerations affecting this draft directive in his speech this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i did not wish to interrupt the noble lord but that was precisely the point i made <e> <s> i said that the draft as at present drawn was unacceptable and that it ought to be amended to ensure that part-time people were given the same right proportionately but no better right <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of speakers in the debate this evening is i think some indication itself of the importance which your lordships attach to the probation service <e> <s> like other noble lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for raising this issue tonight <e> <s> i think that most of the relevant points have already been covered and very well covered in the speeches which have been made but i thought that one brief contribution from the cross-benches might be in point in part perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords i said or meant to say that they were not decreasing as much as i had thought <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the noble lord the minister on this matter but it is extremely important <e> <s> i should like to ask two questions <e> <s> first does the answer which the minister gave mean that the government now regard the act as a permanent measure notwithstanding that it was introduced as a purely temporary arrangement notwithstanding that the modest lump sum it provides for is not indexed and notwithstanding that its actual operation is full of glaring inconsistencies according to the particular part of the country in which one happens to live <e> <s> secondly does his answer mean that the government have definitely decided not to change <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for that very helpful and informative reply which incidentally is the very first statement made by government since the date of publication of the report practically nine months ago <e> <s> may i ask the minister this the procedure as recommended by the royal commission and by the white paper to which the noble lord referred has been shown in some repects to be inappropriate <e> <s> it is a very complex issue <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister could tell us whether it is proposed to issue an amended white paper or to put a statement in <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give an assurance that there would be no difficulty about the existing registrations of service and other overseas voters being included in the registers of new constituencies if and when they should come into being <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for the information which i requested disappointing though it is coming nine years after the butler committee submitted an urgent interim report recommending these units <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord for the information he gave for which i had not asked which looks distinctly more impressive <e> <s> may i ask him two supplementary questions and i know that he has been giving a great deal of thought to these matters <e> <s> first are the government still committed to an overall programme of places in the first instance and if so when does he think the programme will be achieved <e> <s> secondly do his plans envisage that when the units are available on a more substantial scale some worthwhile relief will be given to the special hospitals and to prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to express my appreciation of the initiative taken by the noble baroness lady faithfull my general sympathy with the objectives of the bill and in particular my support for the proposed reference to a select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords like other speakers i have a considerable sympathy with the noble lord <e> <s> lord elton in having to answer so wide-ranging a debate but even so i propose to extend its scope just a little bit further by saying that it is a matter of some regret to me even if no great surprise that so far i have heard nothing from official quarters of possible changes in the law relating to compensation for personal injuries <e> <s> it would obviously be quite inappropriate for me this evening to attempt to tackle this vast subject in any comprehensive way but i should like to touch on one or two topics where the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might interrupt for one moment to remind the noble lord that there was a judicial inquiry by a judge after it was all over <e> <s> i am not sure whether he is aware of the findings in that inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i do not want to pursue this but in fact the findings went further than that <e> <s> noble lords may recall that a posthumous free pardon was granted to timothy evans <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my sympathy for the purposes at which this bill is aimed and to support the proposal that it should be referred to a select committee although as on a <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the minister for that reply <e> <s> i wonder whether he has been a little optimistic in that he has been good enough to explain to me that the section between chertsey and wisley of rather less than six miles is already running several months behind schedule <e> <s> is he confident that this experience will not be repeated elsewhere <e> <s> may i also ask who pays the extra cost when one of these contracts is not finished in time <e> <s> is it the poor old tax-payer <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the sub-committee i should like to begin by paying my tribute to the manner in which my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i may not have made myself perfectly clear <e> <s> i did not see any prospect of interfering with the date of th march it was the date by which the forms had to be with the department of employment which i think is some time in january <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that it is not currently <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i have a little time but i do not propose to exhaust it <e> <s> i should just like to thank the noble lords the noble baroness and the right reverend prelate for the contributions that they have made to what i thought was an extremely interesting debate <e> <s> i was comforted by the support for urgent action which seemed to be felt on all sides of the house irrespective of party lines <e> <s> i do not have time to comment on individual contributions it would not be appropriate for me to do so but i should like to say how illuminating i found the examples given by the noble lord lord foot and by my noble and learned friend lord bridge of harwich in what i think we should all agree was an authoritative and fascinating speech showing why urgent legislation is desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness very much <e> <s> i also hope that we shall receive a letter or perhaps a question can be arranged on the very important point made by the noble and learned lord about the possibility of there being some procedure for quashing an excessive award by a single member or by the three members of the board <e> <s> i do not want to detain your lordships any further <e> <s> may i just say to the noble earl lord longford that i did not mention his earlier bill because what i was concerned about was legislation legitimising the board <e> <s> whatever other merits his bill had it did not do that <e>", "<cs> my lords it would have put something on a statutory basis but as i read it it was not the board <e> <s> however the record is there <e> <s> i would certainly be the first to pay tribute to the work which the noble earl has done over the years in this context <e> <s> i am sorry that in the time at my disposal i did not have the opportunity of going into more detail about the origins of this whole idea in which i know that the noble earl played a prominent part <e>", "<cs> my lords when these changes were made the fear was expressed that some drivers might become over-confident <e> <s> could the minister tell us whether there are any statistics about the deaths of pedestrians <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister will consider the possibility of issuing a white paper perhaps flecked with green about the possible content of legislation <e> <s> it is plain that some quite difficult and rather controversial issues which are still unresolved are involved <e> <s> would it not facilitate the eventual passage of the bill which itself should be quite short if some of these aspects were threshed out first <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not a question but a reflection that i spent rather too many years looking at the problems of the crown agents and that it is odd to think that they got into their problems because they went into own account business in the belief that if things did go wrong they would be left on their own and would have to fend for themselves <e> <s> how wrong they were and what a sad story it all proved to be <e>", "<cs> my lords while i share the general revulsion at this behaviour i was a little uneasy about the last few words of the original answer if i heard them aright <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble and learned lord this question <e> <s> whatever else may happen in the rest of europe it would be wrong would it not for the government in this country to urge the courts to impose more severe penalties for a particular type of offence <e>", "<cs> my lords i had always thought that we were european <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the bedford and holloway councils thanks to the noble lord the lord president may i ask the minister whether he agrees that it is not just simply a removal job but that it involves a great deal of new construction at egham to accommodate the needs of the combined college <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that reply which perhaps falls just a little way short of giving complete satisfaction <e> <s> would he not accept that this case in which an innocent man was detained compulsorily in rampton for six years has some analogy with the confait case in which an inquiry was held which proved to be very valuable <e> <s> since he refers to the current bill would he not accept that in the light of this case procedures affecting the mentally handicapped ought to be dealt with in the bill itself rather than leaving them to a code of practice which as far as i am aware does not refer anywhere to confessions since it is right is it not that the police officers who first interviewed foster must have ignored completely the judges rules and the administrative directions <e>", "<cs> my lords on that point i should like to ask the noble minister whether it is not a fact that foster was originally charged with three offences two of which were proceeded with and the third of which was left on the file <e> <s> when it became known that some other individual had beyond any doubt committed two of the three offences why did it take the home office two years before it occurred to them that it was conceivable that he might be innocent of the third <e> <s> i am the last person to wish to put the home office in a bad light but it would be interesting to know the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords since the minister says that the one outstanding point on product liability is the financial ceiling does this imply that there has been agreement on the state of the art defence <e>", "<cs> my lords like the previous speakers i am most grateful to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the noble lord has had a very long day but could he say one word about the point the noble baroness lady masham and i raised about the involvement of the community and the possibility of having boards of visitors or whatever you may call them <e>", "<cs> this noble lord lord campbell of alloway has clearly put the case for the amendment as a whole but with some considerable trepidation i should like to say a few words about paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords as the first non-lawyer to take part in these deliberations which have now been going on for rather more than two hours i rise with some diffidence <e> <s> i hope i may be forgiven if my comments sound rather amateur <e> <s> i am in some difficulty because i have down an amendment amendment no <e> <s> which concerns the interrogating of the mentally handicapped and as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has pointed out that amendment covers the same ground as amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the last thing i want to do is to inflict the same speech on your lordships twice <e> <s> however i feel i must say a few words in this context about paragraph <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis of the assurance that the door is not shut and certainly not locked i think that we cannot pursue this matter further today <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i also am very grateful to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for initiating this debate about a service which we discuss too rarely <e> <s> i know that he will not take it amiss if i point out that one of the quotations of the misuse of english with which he entertained us evidently emanated from a local government official and not a civil servant at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is indeed to be congratulated on raising this topic <e> <s> it is an aspect of a subject that we have discussed on more <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked whether the criteria had been changed <e> <s> the minister explained that new tests were imported by the act <e> <s> does that of itself mean that the numbers were reduced that some who were regarded as eligible before that act was passed are no longer regarded as eligible because the rules have been altered <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted merely to say that there is a well-understood policy as to who goes to broadmoor rampton and the other two special hospitals <e> <s> one would hope that there might be a similar policy for the regional units evidently there is not <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a very great pleasure to listen this evening to the speech of the noble and learned lord lord brightman as indeed it was to serve on the committee under his chairmanship <e> <s> he kept us under very firm control and was very strict in seeing to it that we came up with positive proposals as indeed we did <e> <s> altogether it was a fascinating experience and i think some of us ended by knowing rather more about such mysteries as ecclesiastical parishes and welsh local government than we did at the beginning <e> <s> i shall not keep the house for very long as the provisions of the bill and the reasons for them have already been explained with a clarity which could not be excelled but there are one or two points i should like to make <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to make two points <e> <s> first there were those on the committee who expressed the view that there should be no clause at all that the only way forward should be via the clause procedure which explains i think the nature of the compromise which my noble and learned friend has just been expounding <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene and remind the noble lord that he himself took the point earlier on that the whole position has changed since the days of goodman because of clause <e> <s> goodman was looking at an entirely different situation <e>", "<cs> i should prefer to see this signpost remain <e> <s> it gives some indication of the reasons why these powers should be used and i hope that the committee will accept the noble viscounts offer <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards product liability would it not be more realistic to conclude after all this time that there is simply no prospect whatever of getting agreement on a worthwhile directive <e> <s> should it be concluded that this particular exercise be wound up would the government mind all that much particularly given their extraordinary attitude on the state of the art defence <e>", "<cs> my lords are years likely to elapse before the government come to that conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that broadmoor counts as a psychiatric hospital <e> <s> can the minister tell us when the very extensive works which have now been begun there are likely to be completed and how many patients the new hospital will accommodate <e>", "<cs> my lords much of what is in this bill is of considerable interest to me in view of my past experience but this afternoon i wish to raise only one issue and that is one which is of concern to me in my current capacity as chairman of mencap <e> <s> this point which has already been clearly explained by the noble lord lord mishcon relates to the voting rights of long-stay voluntary patients in mental illness and mental handicap hospitals <e> <s> noble lords will look in vain among the long list of miscellaneous provisions in the bill for anything on this point <e> <s> there is nothing there and it is my contention that there ought to be something there <e> <s> if this opportunity is missed there is no saying when another one might arise <e>", "<cs> my lords to return to the motion which is before the house i fear that like the noble lord lord maude of stratford-upon-avon i must with considerable diffidence begin on a personal note <e> <s> as a member of the security commission i shall take care not to say anything which encroaches on the work of that body <e> <s> i am conscious of the fact that i was a member of the fulton committee whose report gave a considerable impetus to the public discussion of these issues which has been going on ever since and also of the fact that i was closely concerned with setting up the franks committee and indeed gave evidence at some considerable length and on more than one occasion to that distinguished body <e> <s> we went to a great deal of trouble at the time as did the committee itself and frankly i have been disappointed at what little has been achieved as a result of the committees report <e> <s> however i know that that is not a unique fate for the report of a departmental committee and i shall try not to let a note of bitterness come into that comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not suggest that it should stay on the statute book and not be used <e> <s> i said that it should stay on the statute book for lack of any acceptable alternative and be used in appropriate cases as it has been <e>", "<cs> my lords i must have put my points very badly to judge by the number of noble lords who have misunderstood and have disagreed with what i did not say <e> <s> i made it clear that i would like section to go and to be replaced by something on the lines of franks <e> <s> i then went on to ask whether the price for doing this might prove too high <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may intervene with the suggestion that that paragraph of itself would not be an additional rule <e> <s> it is all the other paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i was merely suggesting that the purpose of the amendment as i read it is that <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that the noble lords reply gives me complete satisfaction <e> <s> there are one or two comments i should like to make <e> <s> i would have taken it a little better if the noble lord had addressed his remarks to the speech which i made this evening rather than that which i made on second reading but no matter <e> <s> although it is not for me to speak on behalf of the noble lord lord renton i know from discussions with him that he greatly welcomed the early arrangement as a considerable step forward but he shares entirely my view that this was only a step on the way and that there is still a good deal more to be done to achieve satisfaction <e>", "<cs> my lords we naturally hear a good deal about the cases which go wrong but not so much about the cases which are successful <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord will convey to his noble friend and to the other members of the parole board the great appreciation which many of us feel for the conscientious and in general pretty successful way in which they discharge a very difficult task <e>", "<cs> my lords leaving aside the point that these statistics do not cover the prisoners who were not released during the period in question is there not a risk of misunderstanding in that many people tend to compare these periods with the sentences passed by courts <e> <s> am i not right in thinking that a sentence of say years passed by a court could mean as little as five years detention and certainly not more than years <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the occasion for another speech but there are one or two points i should like to make <e> <s> i begin by saying that i was particularly glad that the noble lord lord winstanley referred to the helpful speech of the noble lord lord henderson of brompton on an earlier occasion because i know that the noble lord lord henderson particularly regrets not being able to contribute today <e> <s> i was also very pleased that my noble and learned friends lord denning and lord edmund-davies referred to some of the other important recommendations of the pearson commission for example in relation to assessment of damages periodic payments and road traffic all of which we could debate for a long time <e> <s> i am pleased that the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies scored a hit as i understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the occasion for another speech but there are one or two points i

could debate for a long time <e> <s> i am pleased that the noble and learned lord <e> <s> lord edmund-davies scored a hit as i understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that the product liability directive was likely to result in a successful compromise but am i not right in thinking that that compromise will result in a very weak directive leaving it on certain of the main issues to the individual countries to do precisely what they want <e> <s> in particular if germany and france and some of the others rule out the state of the art defence for drug manufacture as they are likely to do and we keep it is there not a fair prospect of this country being used for experiments being the one place where a company will be able to experiment without any risk of liability if things go wrong <e> <s> are the government really happy about this <e> <s> are the government really content that our citizens should become as it were the guinea-pigs of europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the noble lord the minister on this but can he tell us as a matter of fact whether it is true that it will be open to germany for example to rule out a state of the art defence whereas this government seem determined to keep it <e> <s> is that a fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to be so troublesome to the front bench today but that answer will be heard with regret and indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not possible that rather more suitable recruits might be attracted if ministers were sometimes to express greater appreciation of the help and assistance that they receive from the civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my disappointment which i am sure the minister shares that he is not able to give us more positive news after all this time <e> <s> may i take the opportunity of asking whether the noble lord recalls that on th june he maintained that if we in this country allowed the defence of development risks particularly in the context of drugs and the other countries did not as still seems rather likely there was no risk of this country being used by the drug companies as a place for experiment <e> <s> can he elaborate on why he felt able to come to that conclusion and why he ruled out the possibility of treating drugs differently from other products as i believe the germans do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the noble lord but can he say why <e> <s> we shall be in the position that this will be the one country where the drug companies can operate in the knowledge that if things go wrong they will not be under any liability whereas in other countries they may well be <e> <s> is this not a somewhat uncomfortable situation <e>", "<cs> my lords taking up a point which the minister himself made can he confirm that it is true that in some schools where the film itself is welcome the police are not welcome and that they are not allowed in even to give advice and help about road traffic safety or perhaps more importantly about drugs <e> <s> is that not potentially harmful to the children themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my voice in support of the request for a statement <e> <s> as a surviving member of the pearson royal commission may i also say what good news it is that we seem to be on the verge of completing a reasonably satisfactory agreement <e> <s> may i ask yet again about the defence of development risks in relation to drugs which apparently we are going to allow in this country <e> <s> i have just received a helpful letter from the minister <e> <s> i am very well aware that this is not a simple black and white issue but is it not a fact that in this country unlike in france and germany if things were to go wrong the hapless individual could bear the full burden instead of the manufacturer <e> <s> does the minister appreciate that there are still many of us who hope for a change of heart by the government or by their successor before the relevant legislation is introduced within the permitted three-year period <e>", "<cs> my lords as some reference has been made to me perhaps i may say a few words <e> <s> it is slightly strange that we should be discussing this order made under powers which are not currently available to us <e> <s> however far be it from me to complain about the speed with which the order has been drawn up and presented <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also thank the minister for making his statement and say that it is very good to have what is a reasonably satisfactory agreement after all these years even while it does not achieve perfection <e> <s> but may i ask the noble lord one or two questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for that reply which perhaps falls a little short of giving complete <e>", "<cs> my lords as tends to happen on such an occasion we are having a very wide-ranging debate to which it must be extraordinarily difficult to reply <e> <s> today we have been fortunate enough to have had our debate illuminated by an outstanding maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to be no secret that i am currently chairman of mencap but i suppose i ought also to say that i have the special interest of being president of the league of friends of broadmoor <e> <s> although these are interests i may hasten to add that they are by no means financial interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand on a technical point that the phrase to which the noble lord referred earlier was borne in mind <e> <s> whether there is some subtle distinction i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like this opportunity to pass without expressing my appreciation as chairman of mencap of what is provided in the codes relating to the detention questioning and identification of mentally handicapped persons <e> <s> in expressing my welcome i do so without any of the qualifications or reservations which previous speakers have attached to their welcome <e> <s> during the long period of consultation the home office has been particularly forthcoming and patient in discussing and accepting suggestions put on behalf of mencap <e> <s> the home office if i can speak entirely without prejudice has again shown itself to be a rather splendid department <e>", "<cs> my lords in the expectation that we might have proposals of this kind during the current session i ventured to make some observations on this topic in the debate on the address on th november at col <e> <s> i do not flatter myself that what i said has been widely read and digested but there it is on the record and i do not propose to repeat tonight what i said then <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister laid much emphasis on direct grants to charities but is he aware that many charities receive no direct grant of any kind but nevertheless suffer very much from this particular aspect of vat in regard to what the question describes as refurbishment and renovation work <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether the forthcoming legislation will cover the recent convention on product liability and enable us to discharge our obligations under that agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down may i ask about his reference to the iba <e> <s> as i explained there is a game of participative bingo being hawked around <e> <s> is the noble viscount saying that this is to be left entirely to the iba without any hint of what the government might think <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add just a few words and i can confirm that those few words will be in support of the bill <e> <s> as chairman of the gaming board for eight long years i suppose i can claim some acquaintance with the subject but the views i shall express this evening in the next few minutes are my own and i am in no sense speaking for the board <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that legislation for a national lottery could not really be confined to one for this particular limited purpose <e> <s> is she aware that in the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give an assurance at this stage of the debate that i do not have all that much to add to the points so admirably made by previous speakers in particular by my noble friend lord hayter what now seems rather a long time ago <e>", "<cs> my lords that shows what suffers as a result of trying to use shorthand and trying to speak briefly <e> <s> i entirely accept the noble lords point <e> <s> nevertheless that caused me to look at article of the european convention <e> <s> that provides that everyone should have the right to freedom of expression <e> <s> it goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords as a male member of the sub-committee responsible for the report we are considering this evening i too should like to pay my tribute to the noble baroness lady serota for the way she guided us through the maze and for the way she has introduced the report this evening <e> <s> i should also like to add my thanks to our specialist adviser and the clerk <e> <s> they even seemed to know their way through the processes of the ec and the european parliament <e> <s> we were indeed fortunate to have their help <e>", "<cs> my lords i calculate that i still have minutes left and i hastily reassure my neighbours that i do not propose to use all of it <e> <s> there are just one or two points to make <e> <s> i think we have had a very valuable debate in such parts of the afternoon as have been spared to us by british leyland and the rate support grant <e> <s> as i said at the outset i could not hope to cover all the points and the debate has amply demonstrated that there was a great deal that i did not touch on <e> <s> i should like to say that i was taken to task for not mentioning the report by the noble lord lord goodman <e> <s> as it was i who persuaded him to take on that particular inquiry it was very much present in my mind but it had a rather narrower remit than the discussions today <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point it would be of great help to some of the non-legal members of this house who find some difficulty in following the arguments if the noble and learned lord the lord advocate could say quite simply have the noble lord lord campbell of alloway and the noble and learned lord lord silkin got it right <e> <s> is paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the practice to make interim payments if the final conclusion is likely to take some time <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of intervening as a non-lawyer in this discussion perhaps i may begin by saying i much regretted not being able to be present at the committee stage <e> <s> i entirely agree with the points made by my noble friend lord lloyd of hampstead and it is gratifying that the noble lord lord broxbourne has accepted in principle the point that was then made and that we are now just arguing about words and not about principle <e>", "<cs> my lords may i do so for a moment <e> <s> i think i am right in believing that the noble lord lord hooson was not suggesting that we should revert to the clause as printed in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in thinking that in addition to the two charitable trusts which have been referred to there are some other organisations of a non-charitable kind connected with the unification church so that a decision five years hence to strike the two charities off the register will not necessarily mean the end of this particular church <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill has been slightly improved during its passage but i should not like it to go to another place without putting on record that even as amended it is not a bill that leaves here with universal approbation <e> <s> i have no intention of again going over the arguments about its creating uncertainty and tipping the balance between parliament and the judges too far in the direction of the judiciary but i still feel that we should be better off without such legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this question <e> <s> when the chairman of the board was discussing this case on the radio he said that he could not be removed from office <e> <s> as the scheme itself has no statutory backing and can be altered by the home secretary by a stroke of the pen cannot the home secretary alter the membership just as he sees fit <e> <s> i am not suggesting that the chairman should be removed from office but quite a number of us would like to know what the powers of the home secretary are <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the evening i shall be very brief particularly as most of <e>", "<cs> my lords while the ministers statement today is very satisfactory is it not disquieting that provisions were included in the finance bill as introduced which suggested to use a kindly word that those concerned had precious little knowledge of how charities actually work <e> <s> my understanding is that the charity commission was not consulted and if that is so is it not carrying budget secrecy to absurd lengths when the government cannot even consult their own experts if they happen not to be in the treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords it is obviously important to take the greatest possible care over selection but even so i learnt with something approaching incredulity in reply to a written question of mine that the process of dealing with applications averaged weeks <e> <s> grateful though i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by offering congratulations and good wishes to the noble earl on his new appointment <e> <s> i hope that he will find enough to do <e> <s> i thank the noble earl for that not very helpful reply <e> <s> given in particular the delays in getting new charities registered and the evident need for the government to have competent advice about charity law and given the nature of the provisions included in the finance bill as originally introduced is there not a powerful and indeed overwhelming case for strengthening the charity commission at all levels <e> <s> am i not right in thinking that at present they do not have any account-ants on the staff and that the register is still not computerised <e>", "<cs> my lords following up the point made by the noble lord lord mishcon one hears rather disquieting rumours that the treasury staff inspectors have been suggesting that the charity commission should do rather less and should in effect reduce the quality of their advice to trustees <e> <s> can the minister give an assurance that in the deliberations that are going on the government will remain concerned that the charity commission should if anything step up their responsibilities for dealing with breaches of trust and propriety of behaviour on the part of charity trustees <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of the amendment <e> <s> for good or bad i was concerned with the problems covered by the bill over a long period <e> <s> indeed although it hardly bears thinking about i had some slight involvement with the act <e> <s> one aspect that has bothered me throughout has been the contribution to disorder made by those who attach themselves to any march or demonstration that is going not because they have any concern with the object of the march or demonstration but simply in the hope of making trouble themselves or joining in the trouble that anyone else starts <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that reply which is at least as informative as the answer he gave to my question yesterday <e> <s> is the problem this that ministers are concerned that the mental health review tribunals applying the statutory criteria to the best of their ability have discharged restricted patients who then unfortunately turn out still to be a danger to the public <e> <s> if that is right will the minister give us some indication of the size of the problem <e> <s> have there been just one or two cases that have gone wrong or is the number substantially greater than that <e> <s> do the difficulties arise only in respect of psychopaths and not in respect of other mentally disordered offenders <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the prospect of having mental health legislation which is outlined as a possibility in this consultative document take us into pretty deep waters involving as it does rather tricky considerations of treatment as against punishment possibly the role of the parole board and the mental health act commission and also responsibilities under the european convention on human rights <e> <s> will there be an opportunity for us to debate those issues before we plunge too deeply into legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord seebohm to whom we are greatly indebted for initiating this important debate has very clearly explained the background <e> <s> i propose to plunge straight in with my brief remarks about the two topics in which i had some involvement consumer protection and the recognition of higher education diplomas <e>", "<cs> my lords is it intended that the chief inspectors report be published <e>", "<cs> my lords what the minister has said emphasises the need for getting on with the general directive because i assume that there is very little effort left over to complete the sectoral directive <e> <s> may i ask him this question the united kingdom presidency will be coming to an end quite soon <e> <s> when it does what can we say we have achieved during our presidency as regards advancing progress on this important directive which could be so beneficial to this country <e> <s> in particular does he think that by the end of this year it will be possible for the government to announce whether they have come to any view on the solution propounded by the select committee which we debated on the th october <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that both the general directive and the sectoral directives are months if not years away <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl for that answer i am tempted to congratulate the government on the alacrity with which they have followed up the idea set out in this question but i suppose that it is conceivable that by coincidence they were already thinking about the possibility <e> <s> even if an amnesty were not to achieve the results of the last one held years ago when some guns were handed in is it not worthwhile doing anything which might result in some reduction of the number of guns lying around waiting to be burgled and added to a flourishing black market <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my welcome to this bill with perhaps a special word of appreciation at the outset for the general safety requirement in clause <e> <s> the clause may be open to criticism on points of detail but the general approach is one that i hope will mark a path to be followed by all our trading partners in the ec extending possibly to goods for export as well as to those for home consumption <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to break the thread of the noble lord but if he is leaving that point is he trying to say that in no conceivable circumstances could we have another tragedy comparable with the thalidomide tragedy <e>", "<cs> we have been discussing this matter for a long time and i do not propose to inflict a lengthy speech on the committee <e> <s> the official handout from the department stated that the arguments were finely balanced but one would hardly gather that from the ministers summing up <e> <s> we all realised when we started on this amendment that taking on the farming community in this place is a formidable undertaking and that there would be a strong body of opinion that farmers must be treated quite unlike any other producers <e>", "<cs> a long time ago much earlier today we had some questions about the merits of the parliamentary draftsmen for whom i have the greatest admiration <e> <s> however as an innocent clause really defeats me <e> <s> i am pleased to hear that i am in good legal company in being puzzled by it <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i count as one of the intelligent people referred to by the noble baroness lady seear but if i do i still do not understand the gloss <e>", "<cs> as a supporter of this amendment i should like to say a few words backing up the proposals made what now seems a long time ago by the noble baroness <e> <s> i was very glad to hear the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil in an admirable speech with practically all of which i disagreed begin by reminding us that this is an issue which in practice will arise very rarely indeed <e> <s> it is also worth bearing in mind that the minister has more than once been on <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down perhaps i may say that i am sorry that he did not touch on the point that the directive allows for review in years time <e> <s> if the matter is so clear cut i wonder what was the thinking that lay behind putting that provision into the directive <e> <s> what was the motive or the intention in ensuring that this particular defence should be looked at again the way in which it worked should be observed and then a decision taken as to whether it should be repealed <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to pursue this matter but there is a specific reference not to the articles in general but to this particular defence <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that those of us who have had some concern with these matters even in the home office think that the conclusion which has been reached by the government is absolutely right <e> <s> he has just referred to a review of procedural matters that is changes which can be made without amending the law and i should like to ask him further whether he will undertake to make public in some way or another whatever decisions the government finally come to <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to thank the noble earl and all the others who have taken part in the debate i think i can justifiably repeat what i said at the beginning <e> <s> there is no need to apologise for having this debate today less than a year after the previous debate <e> <s> it has been an extremely interesting and important one <e> <s> i should like to read very carefully what the minister said <e> <s> i do not claim to have taken it all in and i hope that for his part he will read carefully what we and other contributors to the debate have said <e>", "<cs> my lords are there any plans to increase the number and the duties of traffic wardens <e> <s> also is it thought that when the crown prosecution service gets going this will provide some relief to police manpower <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to abolish as regards england and wales the restrictions by way of licensing or otherwise on the public playing of billiards bagatelle and other games of the like kind under related power of entry <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister about the possibility of implementing section which is the section concerned with discharge from long-term hospitals <e> <s> no reference was made to that section in the debate in another place on th february <e> <s> however is it not a fact that the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i need only to say that it is gratifying to have the support of both the government and the opposition <e> <s> i should like to make two small points on the matters raised by the noble lord lord kilbracken <e> <s> under the act it is a term of the licence that the premises which hold the licence must display a notice saying licensed for billiards <e> <s> that is one of the absurdities in that billiards is not one of the games that are played <e> <s> snooker and pool are the two great games <e> <s> like the noble lord i have searched in vain in the provisions to find a reference to a bagatelle table <e> <s> as the minister has explained the numbers are or over which includes for example youth clubs which do not have a formal membership and there are still a few establishments which started life in the north as temperance halls set up in rivalry to public houses <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly not claim that the measure was one of extreme constitutional importance if i heard the words correctly <e> <s> but i think it is a useful tidying-up measure <e> <s> my lords i commend the bill to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words in support of this amendment to which i have put my name and i should also like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it will be recalled that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate told us at an earlier stage that the government had decided to proceed by way of synthesising the force of what is in the directive rather than putting the directive itself in the bill <e> <s> it seems to me that here the synthesis has strayed a little too far from what is actually in the directive <e> <s> it is rather as though the film of the book has moved too far from the original plot <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who expressed an inability to understand either the subsections or the explanation i am very grateful for the decision that the government have taken <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a pretty radical departure from the directive <e> <s> i am genuinely puzzled to know why in this respect the synthesis has strayed so far from the original <e> <s> it has been pointed out that article e of the directive lays down an objective test in simple unambiguous terms <e> <s> but to my mind the provision in the bill imports a subjective element <e> <s> i am not a lawyer but the drafting of the bill seems to bear a distinct family likeness to the existing legal test in negligence <e> <s> it would be all too easy to slip into the test of whether another similar producer might reasonably be expected to have discovered the defect <e> <s> the introduction of this concept of expectation strikes me as being a distinct watering down of the clear and simple provision in the directive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister and to those noble lords who have taken part in this debate including the noble lord lord porritt for his spirited defence of an industry which is not under attack <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister and to the noble lord for the eloquent way in which they expanded the point which i tried humbly to make about the improvements which have taken place since the pearson commission sat in the control and supervision of new drugs <e> <s> the noble lord lord porritt will be comforted by the fact that he sees the possibility of another tragedy being so remote as to be reflected in the small insurance premiums which the companies will no doubt be called upon to pay <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord the minister dismissed so light-heartedly the validity of a warning about the unknown consequences of using drugs against aids which i thought was a simple enough warning <e> <s> i am sorry that he in his view no doubt has been so inadequately supported from behind that he has had to quote the views of noble lords who are not present this evening but who managed to convey their views at an earlier stage <e> <s> i am under no such obligation <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not just a question of the judges or the man in the street <e> <s> there are practising solicitors who might well be consulted by clients about the application of this directive and i cannot imagine that a solicitor in stoke-on-trent or ashton-under-lyne would have ready access to the documents that we have been discussing <e> <s> if the amendment itself is defective let the government put it right by all means but let us have for convenience the text of the directive attached to the bill and attached to some peg or other <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> unless therefore any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has sat on two royal commissions and one tribunal of inquiry the reports of which the government almost totally ignored i confess to having some slight mental reservations about the suggestion of setting up a committee however strong the argument for doing so <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies has tempted me to expatiate this evening on the pearson royal commission report <e> <s> however i think that at this stage of the evening i had better content myself with saying just a few words about the medical profession underlining in the main the points so eloquently made by the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitated before speaking today but i should not like the bill to leave this house without saying that it is a source of gratification that part i will enable this country to put into effect the ec directive on product liability which was at last concluded after so many years of delay and disappointment <e> <s> it has not been very encouraging to those of us who laboured pretty hard and certainly pretty long on the pearson commission that our report has been so largely ignored <e> <s> it would be churlish of me not to recognise that at any rate one of our main recommendations has at long last been implemented <e> <s> i should like to add my appreciation for the way in which the minister responded to the arguments put in the course of debate even though sometimes he came to the wrong conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not previously contributed to the debates on this bill and i should like to make just a brief contribution and repeat the appreciation which my noble friend lord henderson has just expressed for the way in which the government have responded to the representations put to them at an earlier stage <e> <s> on a point which was raised by the noble lord lord morton of shuna it seems to me that this amendment applies only to the mentally handicapped and not to the mentally ill sometimes the distinction is not always kept as clear as it might be <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if there is not some confusion here between mental handicap and mental illness since the clause is limited to the mentally handicapped <e> <s> it is expecting rather too much of an ordinary gp to be able to certify whether someone comes within the definition <e> <s> however i do not object to what the minister has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not previously ventured to take part in a debate on education and i rise with considerable diffidence to make a modest contribution as an amateur among so many professionals <e> <s> the terms of the motion have permitted an important and very wide-ranging debate to take place and we are fortunate to have had it illuminated by such a distinguished maiden speech <e> <s> for my part i propose to speak only about universities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not regrettable that at a time when it is so important to build up confidence in the metropolitan police the independent police complaints authority has been driven to stating publicly that unlike what happens in other forces senior metropolitan police officers do not reply promptly to letters sent to them personally by members of the authority <e> <s> when a reply eventually arrives it usually comes from someone else in the organisation <e> <s> will the minister ask his right honourable friend to call for a report from the commissioner in <e> <s> say six months time to show that this criticism has been taken to heart and to make sure that there has been a real improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords the police complaints authority must have been extremely moved to have made this complaint in public in the way it did <e> <s> i know just a little about relations between the home secretary and the commissioner of police <e> <s> i wonder whether i may have an answer to the question i asked about the possibility of calling for a report in six months time to see what has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged for that answer which is clearer than some we occasionally have from the front bench opposite <e> <s> is the minister aware that medical negligence claims have been increasing in number that insurance premiums have been rocketing upwards and that some valuable resources are already being diverted to defensive medicine in case there should be a subsequent claim for negligence <e> <s> if the government are not prepared to fall in with the proposal which emanates from the bma for a pilot no-fault scheme what are they proposing to do <e> <s> we are on a slippery slope and if nothing is done and we go drifting on will not things get steadily worse <e>", "<cs> my lords it would have been nice to have had an answer to my question <e> <s> however if i am unlucky on that may i ask whether the government as the pearson royal commission recommended in have been keeping a close eye on the way that no-fault medical injury schemes are operating in the countries where they are in force notably new zealand sweden and more recently in finland <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i do not wish to pursue this matter now but perhaps i may tell the minister that the difficulties are very well known <e> <s> will he not convey to his right honourable friend the need to do something <e> <s> we have a perfectly good no-fault system for industrial injuries <e> <s> is it not possible to consider introducing some solution in this very important and difficult field <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to say how sorry i am that the government decided to reverse engines and to put back the form of words which had been replaced in this house by an amendment which was voted on after full discussion <e> <s> i am equally sorry that we have still not heard or read any satisfactory explanation i say this with no disrespect to the minister but i suppose we never shall <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for the answer and congratulate the government on having discovered the existence of the civil justice review of which they were evidently unaware when i asked a supplementary question on th may <e> <s> while the review may result in simplifying and speeding up procedures in the civil courts it was specifically precluded from examining proposals made by the pearson commission <e> <s> is the noble earl suggesting that there is anything in the review that would affect the size of awards in the kind of case dealt with by my question namely the increased premiums which doctors have to pay the increasing use of defensive medicine involving valuable resources in case there should be an action for negligence and the prospect of confrontation which means that patients have difficulty getting information from the authorities in the first instance <e> <s> or are the government content that we should drift steadily towards the situation that now prevails in california and new york <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend said that this review has nothing to do with the main question which i raised <e> <s> i ask the minister this simple question <e> <s> do the government recognise that this is a special case requiring special treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords it makes me feel what i can only describe as slightly nostalgic when i think of all the previous criminal justice bills in which i have taken part over the years starting with one which had to be abandoned at the outbreak of war in <e> <s> the present bill has happily only had the hiccup of a general election and serves the desirable purpose like its predecessors of providing a somewhat mixed bag of what on the whole are very useful reforms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for tabling the motion on the report of the commissioner of the metropolitan police and for his excellent speech initiating the debate <e> <s> having been concerned with the police for quite a substantial part of my official career i welcome the opportunity to <e>", "<cs> my lords i have indeed been chairman of mencap for some years in succession to my illustrious predecessor who has just spoken <e> <s> i propose in my few minutes contribution to this timely debate for which we are all grateful to the noble lord lord carter

reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he has considered the opinion by a very eminent qc which was sent to him some time ago confirming the view which was expressed here that the present wording of the relevant subsection replacing as it did an amendment passed in this house does not comply with the ec directive <e> <s> is he not concerned that if this matter goes to the european court of justice the likelihood is that we shall suffer yet another defeat at the hands of the court <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that brussels has been notified that we have conformed with the directive <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having put down my name to speak <e> <s> having raised the question of medical accidents more than once on previous occasions i should like to contribute a few words on that aspect <e>", "<cs> more than that my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add one or two words <e> <s> i had intended to add my name to amendment no <e> <s> as well as no <e> <s> to make sense but no doubt if it was agreed in principle the parliamentary draftsman would not accept any of the drafting so perhaps it does not matter all that much <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall only delay your lordships for a few minutes <e> <s> however i am bound to say that the noble lord invited me to be critical and i shall therefore make one or two comments <e> <s> i had some difficulty in recognising the report that the noble lord seemed to be discussing as the one that was laid before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> but may i ask him whether he recalls that when a report from the european select committee was being debated on th october last year the government at that stage felt able to say very little about the criticisms and suggestions which the committee had made about that draft general directive <e> <s> may i ask him whether the government have now formulated their views and if so whether they have conveyed them to the commission if not to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house when the report from sir roy griffiths will be received and more importantly published <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with those who have expressed admiration for the noble lord lord broxbourne for his persistence in raising this important issue in your lordships house <e> <s> but i have to confess that i have been a little surprised at the form the debate has taken <e> <s> in my simple-minded innocence i had thought that we were going to discuss the motion on the order paper <e> <s> that raises the question whether what was decided in these five cases bears any relevance to the traditional views which the noble lord has put before us from time to time <e> <s> in fact his speech as will be recalled eloquently defended a bill which is not before your lordships house <e> <s> it was without reference to the five individual cases <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the importance of securing the free movement of professionally qualified workers as part of the completion of the market is the minister able to give any up to date information about progress on the general directive as regards mutual recognition of higher education diplomas which i believe it is hoped will be finalised this year <e>", "<cs> i rise to make a brief contribution from the cross-benches in support of the amendment <e> <s> perhaps i ought to say that i had some concern in the past with criminal legal aid and more to the point i served for some years in the treasury <e> <s> the extensive regulation-making powers in the bill are very much subject to the control of that great department <e> <s> like the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones i cannot help thinking that in settling the terms of these regulations it could well be of assistance to the noble and learned lord if the basic purposes of the bill and the overall responsibility to be assumed by the lord chancellor were set out in terms at the outset <e> <s> it would be of great help to parliament in considering whether the regulations as they appear comply fully with the intentions of the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to interrupt the noble lord but i wonder whether he is quite right in suggesting that the official custodian offers investment advice <e> <s> he manages the workload but i do not think that the trustees can turn to him for advice if i am correctly informed <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i wonder whether he could say one word about scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not use my allotted time but i should like to say that it has been a most interesting debate and i look forward to reading in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to consider carefully what the noble and learned lord has said before coming to any conclusion <e> <s> i would simply make the point that this is a special defence in a very special sense in that there is this general provision in the consumer protection act to rule out the defence of negligence <e> <s> here is a way left open for a defence which could mean that we would have another thalidomide case <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that care in the community is not a cheap option <e> <s> although mencap and other voluntary organisations are grateful for any help will the minister accept that the main burden of providing necessary resources must fall on the public authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask a little more about the administration of this fund <e> <s> i find the matter rather puzzling because the disablement income group itself has said that it is not running the scheme whereas the minister in another place said that the group would be managing it <e> <s> i am not quite sure what is the difference <e> <s> i wonder whether in those circumstances the minister can explain what happens if someone becomes disabled after next april <e> <s> to whom does he apply for help under the scheme <e> <s> who is to assess his needs <e> <s> will the payment be a lump sum or will it be a weekly sum <e> <s> most important of all if the disabled person is turned down to whom does he appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that reply which may perhaps come as a surprise to some <e> <s> while i have no doubt that comic relief ran its recent successful appeal quite properly does the minister agree that his answer highlights the fact that there is at present no effective statutory control over fund-raising activities <e> <s> does he therefore agree and i believe that the organisers of comic relief would go along with this themselves that there ought to be some such provision in the legislation on charities which the government have promised <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the government have yet made up their minds to produce a white paper outlining what may be contained in such future legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words in support of the amendment <e> <s> although the noble lord lord carter for reasons that i can understand said that he did not wish to explore the philosophic problems that arise by the provision of such a scheme i had grave doubts before deciding to add my name to this proposal since i am not attracted in principle by a scheme that involves removing the basic rights of severely disabled people to weekly payments from the state scheme to meet their established needs and compelling them instead to apply for funds to trustees outside the official hierarchy <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that the family fund does not go in for regular weekly payments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord for that answer which is slightly more encouraging than i had expected <e> <s> the act which was supported on all sides of the house received the royal assent on th july <e> <s> here we are almost in sight of a time when two years have elapsed before we have a firm date <e> <s> does the minister accept that if a mentally ill or mentally handicapped person is to be discharged from hospital an essential part of any policy of care in the community must be that plans should be made in advance for that person <e> <s> does he further agree that the present position up and down the country is rather patchy and highly unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords having put my name on the amendment perhaps i may say a few words in support of it <e> <s> the continuing needs of that splendid hospital both for capital and for income are well known <e> <s> there could hardly have been a worse moment for cutting off after all these years the modest but steady income which has come in from the <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few additional words from the cross benches to emphasise the point that this is not a suggestion involving just the party politicians <e> <s> as i understand it present practice and the proposed arrangements take into account the needs of the disabled <e> <s> therefore the acceptance of this amendment would not mean changes in what is at present being done and what is proposed despite the points that have been made earlier in the debate <e> <s> however to put it at its lowest i believe it would be an important gesture to give statutory backing to this provision <e> <s> it would have the practical effect of ensuring that future programmes were bound to take account of such a requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak today <e> <s> i was very interested to see that the government have mustered rather greater support here than they managed in another place <e> <s> listening to the discussions i have been increasingly struck by the difficulties i shall have in explaining the reasons for the government decision when i chair the meeting of the national council of mencap this coming saturday <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer and for clarifying the rather confused statements that have appeared in the newspapers <e> <s> am i right in thinking that the widely reported statement that there will be no prosecution of motorists who are found to be over the limit is quite wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of what happens to the driver after he has been stopped is irrelevant <e> <s> the question relates to the offence which he has already committed before he is stopped <e> <s> what i am seeking to find out is whether if that information comes to light either to the police or <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the government to think again <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to prolong the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall limit my remarks to the subjects of academic freedom and children with special education needs <e> <s> i cannot help reflecting that it is not so long ago that responsibility for universities was transferred to the department of education for the first time <e> <s> if that had not happened we might have had two separate bills before us instead of this massive and unmanageable document that we are considering today <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply about this rather puzzling arrangement <e> <s> can the minister say whether it is proposed to revive the universities committee of the privy council for which provision was made in the earlier legislation affecting the oxford and cambridge colleges <e> <s> can she elaborate a little on what the officials in the department of education and science will be expected to do accepting that the bill provides no role for the des in this context and that some of the findings of the commissioners will involve amending acts of parliament without parliament even being told <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister seen the very complicated and formidable form which would-be applicants have to fill in if they succeed in discovering the existence of this fund <e> <s> it is not surprising that fewer than half have been received <e> <s> is not such a complicated form in itself a deterrent and could not the trustees be encouraged to think of something a little simpler <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a debate on an important topic <e> <s> we are much indebted to the noble lord lord basnett for arranging it even if it <e>", "<cs> as amendment no <e> <s> has been grouped with the others perhaps i could say a word about it <e> <s> it is aimed at the same goal as the amendment moved by the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead but i should like to put on record that it tries to reach it by a different route <e> <s> it would put an obligation on the university to satisfy the commissioners that it had made provision which ensured that academic freedom within the law was secured for members of that university <e> <s> in adopting that approach the amendment follows the precedent of section of the education no <e> <s> act which provided <e>", "<cs> i have great sympathy with the amendments just moved by the noble lord lord morton of shuna more particularly because in my second reading speech i recommended that what is proposed should be done <e>", "<cs> in view of the changes which have been made to the bill since it was first introduced does not that mean that in practice nearly every case will come within clause in that it is not just talking about an act of parliament but also about charters <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord said that in the light of his explanation i am wrong about the charters <e> <s> he said that my amendment is uncalled for <e> <s> i take a different view <e> <s> i think that his explanation has made it more important in that contrary to my own amateur view <e>", "<cs> will the noble and learned lord consider withdrawing the amendment until we have the grievance procedure so that we can see it all in balance <e>", "<cs> i was not suggesting that we should not have the procedure i was suggesting that we had only half the story and that it would be nice to see it all <e>", "<cs> in that case i should like to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble earl that we have had a most useful debate and i learnt with interest of the amendments that it is proposed to introduce to the definition of severely mentally handicapped especially no longer limiting it to congenital mental handicap <e> <s> however i am afraid that i must have been even more muddled than i usually am when the noble earl referred to my reference to the registration officer <e> <s> i was merely <e>", "<cs> i also did not hear anything about a possible right of appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords since the question looks to the future is it worth putting on record that the police national computer has now been functioning for some years and that originally the police themselves were very dubious about its benefits but since it was forced upon them they have come to value its contribution towards the detection of crime <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister gave some figures concerning the mentally ill <e> <s> does he have comparable figures for the mentally handicapped <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of striking a slightly discordant note does the minister agree that in the present state of knowledge there is some risk of expecting rather too much of these schemes <e> <s> there have been various rather disconnected pieces of research carried out <e> <s> is it proposed to have a rather more elaborate programme of research which would for the first time so far as i know provide a scientific evaluation of the impact of these schemes on the commission and detection of crime <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that some of those figures may call for a little more scientific assessment for example to take account of the changes in the pattern of reporting offences to the police <e>", "<cs> my lords i associate myself with the tribute but we always like to get things accurate in this house <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton having served as chairman and then as president is now a past president of the society <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i am disappointed by that reply given the support for my suggestion tendered from all sides of the house including those members of the house sitting behind the minister <e> <s> on the point made by the noble baroness lady carnegy i should have preferred to go down the road of rebate but i regarded that as a dead duck following our discussions in committee <e> <s> the minister has in effect confirmed that there has been no consultation with experts outside the government machine which i find disappointing <e>", "<cs> my lords it has not consulted mencap which does know something about these matters <e> <s> of course the reply does not go to the root of the matter <e> <s> the minister does not seem to understand any more than his officials seem to understand what an important decision this is in the life of the individuals concerned not only for the individuals but for the family <e> <s> they will need reassurance when they see their son or daughter subject to a certificate which marks him or her out as someone detached from the whole of the rest of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very reluctant to decide the fate of these poor people by <e>", "<cs> my lords to say that i am disappointed with that reply would be putting it rather mildly <e> <s> the minister not for the first time has found himself the only voice against what is proposed <e> <s> there have been a number of supporting voices from different parts of the house <e> <s> i do not believe that even the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour was opposed to the principle <e> <s> on the point that the noble baroness made to begin with i maintain that this is not a departure from the principle at all <e> <s> it is a refinement of the rather rough and ready methods adopted by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords as a supporter of the amendment in the name of my noble friend lord hayter perhaps i may be permitted to say how much i appreciate the decision to which the government have come <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that he was not aware of how i reacted to his arguments on report <e> <s> i can tell him now that there was nothing in what he said to persuade me <e> <s> if he later asks whether his arguments at this stage have persuaded me the answer is the same <e> <s> mencap was not consulted about the proposal <e> <s> the noble lord lord hunter of newington as i well know was concerned with qualifications and experience in mental health <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the only report which urges a clear national framework for community care <e> <s> is the minister aware that the slowness of the government in acting in this context coupled with the provisions of the local government finance bill as it reached this house which will have the effect of driving many of the poor and disabled out of the community into residential care raise doubts about whether the government still believe in the policy of care in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under the impression that we were discussing amendments numbered to and that we had not yet reached amendment numbered b <e> <s> i for my part am not proposing to make any comment at this stage on the constitutional aspect except to say that i recognise that in view of the reason given by the house of commons for rejecting our amendments there can be no question of our challenging the decision taken by the elected chamber <e> <s> however i was interested and very grateful to the minister for not limiting himself to that reason but for giving an explanation if i may say so in rather more convincing terms than has previously been forthcoming for the reasons taken by the house of commons on my amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether i am in order in speaking again but may i say briefly that i stand by what i said at earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> contrary to what the noble lord seemed to imply i have not been suggesting that these poor people should be deprived of the vote <e>", "<cs> my lords again before the noble lord sits down will he check what he said about sir john masterman <e> <s> in sir johns interests it is right to have on record that he went for persuasion and not pre-publication <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the pearson royal commission i wonder whether the minister will look again at the way he summarised its conclusion on medical injuries <e> <s> would it not be more accurate to say that the commission came to the conclusion that on the available information it was not prepared to recommend a no-fault scheme but recommended that the government should see what went on in the rest of the world where no-fault schemes were operating and perhaps think again when further experience had been gained <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord for that answer which at any rate means that we are not going backwards <e> <s> as the civil justice review was precluded from considering the substantive law of negligence may i ask the noble and learned lord who seems to be in a reforming mood whether there will be an opportunity to consider the pearson recommendation for a no-fault system for road traffic accidents broadly on the lines of the industrial injuries scheme a recommendation which has never been adequately debated in the house over all these years and on which there is now a wealth of experience in other parts of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that the recommendation of the pearson commission was not to follow the new zealand precedent it was more related to the industrial injuries scheme here which covers large awards by the courts in serious cases <e> <s> as i recall the estimate was that the cost could be met by say two pence on a gallon of petrol prices of petrol varying so much that one would hardly notice the difference <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the best ways to ensure that progress is slow and halting on any topic is to select one that straddles the responsibilities of more than one department of state <e> <s> it is something that bedevilled the work of the pearson royal commission at the outset and it affects the topics that we are discussing today <e> <s> i am well aware of the efforts which are being made to improve co-ordination between the home office and the department of health in this area but it is not easy <e> <s> in the meantime i must express some sympathy for the noble earl who has to reply to this debate and the wide-ranging issues which are being raised <e>", "<cs> my lords it is now some three and a half hours since we started this debate and i do not propose to prolong it appreciative as i am of the amount of business still to be done <e> <s> being astounded at my own moderation although there has been so much talk of independent living i do not even intend to talk about the possible effect of the poll tax on that concept <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try not to occupy the whole of the five minutes generously left to me <e> <s> i said what now seems a very long time ago that this would not be a party debate and that point has been borne out <e> <s> we have had a fascinating and constructive debate with suggestions coming from all sides of the house a debate enriched to use lord sopers word by an outstanding maiden speech and by two extremely interesting contributions from law lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the draft financial memorandum between the department and the funding council will require the council to keep under review the level of balances of universities without any qualification or any reservation or indeed any reference to moneys which universities may have otherwise than by way of grant <e> <s> does the minister think that that is consistent with the provisions in the act to which the question relates <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear about section and discharge from hospitals <e> <s> is the minister aware that it is now two and a half years since royal assent was given to the act <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting short debate <e> <s> my experience suggests that it would have been disquieting if we had managed to produce a report which received unanimous approval <e> <s> that would indeed give grave cause for suspicion <e>

prospect of this section being implemented before we reach the third anniversary of the date on which royal assent was given to the act that is th july next <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the secretary of state for that answer unsatisfactory though it is <e> <s> does the noble lord recall that the house amended the relevant clause of the consumer protection bill so as to make it conform to the directive <e> <s> however in another place right at the end of the session and after a brief discussion the wording was restored against which we are told that proceedings are now to be instituted by the commission <e> <s> could not the government admit that in the hurry they got it wrong <e> <s> were they to do so they could avoid a prolonged period of uncertainty which is only too likely to end in another defeat in the european court <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state aware that the commission has two other grounds on which it believes that the act does not implement the directive <e> <s> is it his intention to brave it out on those two grounds as well <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in addition to delay many elderly people also have problems getting to remote and inaccessible hospitals <e> <s> can more be done in the way of providing local hearing aid centres with a reference to hospital made only when that proves necessary <e>", "<cs> i am not a lawyer and therefore i venture into the discussion with some diffidence <e> <s> however i hope that the committee will not accept these two amendments <e> <s> it seems to me that the wording of the bill expresses what experience has shown to be the areas at risk <e> <s> members of the committee will be aware that it has been the policy of the government for some years that no one should be employed on work vital to the security of the state who is or has recently been a member of a communist or fascist organisation or of a subversive group <e>", "<cs> i have been somewhat involved officially in these matters over a considerable period of time <e> <s> i am still a member of the security commission <e> <s> in fact i am its longest-serving member <e> <s> i felt it inappropriate to speak on second reading but i feel that i must venture a brief contribution on the amendment <e> <s> incidentally i have been just a shade surprised that no reference except a passing reference by the noble lord lord callaghan has been made to the security commission seeing that in the case of bettany we had a great deal to say about the organisation and <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord for making his position so clear <e> <s> on an earlier amendment the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones said that the wording lacked precision <e> <s> with the greatest possible respect i

name to this amendment and i should like to say a few words in support of the proposal put forward by the noble lord lord carter <e>", "<cs> i would willingly have done so but the point had already

realise that this is a very complicated subject <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will forgive me if i say that his reply falls perhaps a little short of the normal standards of clarity which we are accustomed to hearing from him in reply to amendments <e> <s> he said that the points raised had been muddled <e> <s> i do not think they were muddled by contributors to the debate <e> <s> i also believe that inevitably the discussion turned into a debate on <e>", "<cs> i should say that the select committee to which the noble baroness lady turner of camden referred received its own legal advice which tended to coincide with that received by the government <e> <s> we thought that the proposal as set out in the amendment was a very sensible proposal <e> <s> we had made a recommendation that representation should be made and that the next directive to which our report relates should be amended to enable this to be done <e> <s> but for what it is worth our view was that under the present law and the present directive that could not be done <e> <s> as has been said the real solution is to have equal pension ages <e>", "<cs> i just wanted to confirm that we are not suggesting that the directive which is being implemented by this legislation could be altered <e> <s> we thought that the position could be corrected in the next directive which is the subject of our report <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord carter has explained we are talking about two small and clearly defined groups of people <e> <s> the amendment does not involve any new principle or any radical departure of policy <e> <s> so far as concerns the groups of the mentally handicapped with which i have been particularly concerned it has been accepted that those whose walking difficulties stem from handicaps which can be ascribed to a physical cause such as brain damage whether the consequence of a genetic condition or the result of an accident can qualify for the allowance <e> <s> the additional numbers covered by this amendment estimated to be at the most as the noble lord has explained will be those who are severely mentally handicapped and who have behavioural problems requiring constant supervision but whose handicap has no identifiable physical cause <e> <s> they may be able to walk in the sense of being able to put one foot in front of another but if left to themselves no one would know which way they would walk sideways backwards or straight under a bus or they might choose to lie down screaming in a tantrum in the middle of the highway <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene but my title is abbeydale not abbeyfield which connotes other things <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene because perhaps i did not make it clear that i am speaking about the mentally handicapped <e> <s> the numbers that we are now speaking about are people whose handicap has no identifiable physical cause and who would therefore not be eligible under the present rules <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord speaks as though this amendment has invented the phrase virtually unable to walk <e> <s> it is already in the principal act <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble baroness i would prefer the clause to be left out of the bill altogether <e> <s> if this amendment is not accepted i hope that when we come to discuss the next amendment i shall have an opportunity to explain my reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcomed it because it did that in exactly the opposite way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt <e> <s> am i not right in thinking that the noble viscount is talking about the merits of the clause and not about the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord campbell <e> <s> that is what we are supposed to be discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak in support of the proposal that this clause should be left out <e> <s> after our rather extraordinary debate on the previous amendment i am glad to have the opportunity of explaining briefly why i have formed that conclusion <e> <s> i accept the desirability in principle of avoiding double payments <e> <s> so i arrive at the same conclusion as the noble lord lord mottistone but by a rather different route <e> <s> i wish to add my appreciation of all the trouble the noble lord lord skelmersdale took in writing to us and talking to us <e> <s> i am sorry that like the noble lord lord mottistone i remain unpersuaded that the solution proposed in this clause is fair and just <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that is how the figure came about but the painful fact is that the pac was given totally false information as to what would be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by saying that i am no lawyer but i am quite confident that this could not be done by regulation <e> <s> we went into that possibility with some care before proposing the rather restricted amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain your lordships for very long <e> <s> i do not propose <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i confess that it does not come as any great surprise <e> <s> in considering the response to the draft directive will the minister bear in mind that mr peter lloyd who was a minister in his department said in evidence to the subcommittee that it might be possible for a decision to be reached even before the report of a current opcs survey was expected early in <e> <s> the noble lord will recall on the other hand that he said in the debate on th july merely and not very helpfully that a change was unlikely this century <e> <s> does the minister not agree that it would be highly desirable to have a reasonably early decision including a decision on the timetable so as to put an end to the speculation and uncertainty that surround this matter which is of great importance to millions of people <e> <s> could he not be just a little more forthcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> does he accept that for those prisoners much time and effort have to be spent on carrying out reviews which everyone knows are perfectly futile <e> <s> does he also accept that those arrangements mean that the executive is taking it upon itself to differentiate between the sentences which the judiciary think appropriate <e> <s> does he agree that above all it means that some of the worst and most dangerous prisoners are eventually discharged into the community without any supervision at all <e> <s> some of the other changes which the home secretary is no doubt considering would involve legislation <e> <s> could not this change be made by a stroke of the pen next week <e> <s> can the minister think again <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure of is getting very near what we estimate as the total number of severely mentally handicapped people in the country as a whole <e> <s> only a tiny minority of that figure would qualify under the formula set out in the question and in the amendment to which the minister refers <e> <s> is he not in effect confirming that the mencap estimate of about would be about right <e> <s> in the village where i live which has a population of about the government figures would mean that there would be or potential applicants whereas on the basis of local knowledge based on a good deal of local charitable work i should be very surprised if there were any applicants <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have organised a referendum perhaps i may ask the minister this question leaving aside all the other objections which seem to me conclusive does he agree that there is no point in holding a referendum unless the question posed is susceptible of being answered by a simple yes or no <e> <s> does he further agree that the number of unanswered consequential issues which would arise here means that this <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late stage of the debate i rise with some diffidence since although there was a time when i was involved in the kind of issues we have been talking about this evening it is all some years ago and i am only too conscious that my personal knowledge is getting out of date <e> <s> i can only hope that that fact does not show too prominently in the remarks that i shall make this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read those paragraphs four times <e> <s> i cannot read that point into them as they stand <e> <s> but the statement which the noble lord has just made is of great importance <e> <s> it will be of great interest to all those who have taken part in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but again we seem to be eliciting some very valuable pieces of information which have not been set out in the report <e> <s> would i be right in thinking that it is a considered recommendation of the committee that the judicial tribunal should consist of a judge supported by two assessors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am trying to cover that point as i go along <e> <s> i take it that the noble lord has in mind the resources of the charity commission <e> <s> perhaps the minister will be in a better position than i am to explain what is in prospect <e> <s> i shall come to the point about where the money is coming from in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will permit me to intervene <e> <s> it required legislation to enable the inland revenue to disclose information to the charity commission <e> <s> would it require legislation to enable the serious fraud office and the dti to give information to the charity commission <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a fascinating debate characterised by two very agreeable features a it has in no sense been political and b we have not heard one word about interference from the secretariat in brussels <e>", "<cs> my lords looking at the list of speakers i see that i am no <e> <s> and yet i am only the third non-lawyer to speak <e> <s> i shall be taking a line different from the last non-lawyer to speak <e> <s> i have in mind the noble lord lord benson <e> <s> i was brought up as an inarticulate civil servant <e> <s> i cannot hope to match the eloquence of the noble lords who have spoken hitherto <e> <s> however inadequately i should like to speak in warm support of the bill and the steps that it is taking to improve access to justice to give the consumer a greater choice and to do something to make justice quicker and less expensive <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the provisions of the gaming act relating to premises licensed or registered under part ii of that act <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> as a non-lawyer i venture with great trepidation into what has so far been an almost exclusively legal preserve <e> <s> perhaps i may begin by saying that i am very much in favour of this clause in general as implementing the relevant recommendations of the civil justice review <e> <s> in all humility i have no difficulty on my own initiative in putting the same construction on the clause as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i shall not weary the committee with examples of cases which seem to me to fall outside the bill as it is drafted <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl has explained this short debate is taking place when the probation service is at a crucial point in its history <e> <s> like the noble earl i understand from press reports that the government have it in mind to publish a white paper and a green paper covering this very topic <e> <s> i imagine that the minister will not be able to say very much in advance this evening not that that is entirely without precedent <e> <s> this is however an opportunity to put forward views to which the government will no doubt listen <e> <s> we may also have the bonus of discovering what the policy of the labour party is a matter on which i remain in some doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to point out that the idea of setting up a new service was not mine but one that derived from the green paper <e>", "<cs> i have been reluctant to intervene <e> <s> i have been listening more or less patiently to this very long discussion in which i have heard some rather astonishing things <e> <s> i do not accept for a moment that clause was torn to shreds the other evening <e> <s> some of the descriptions of the role of civil servants and their relationship to ministers bears very little relation to my experience over quite a long period of years <e>", "<cs> i thought i had explained that that is one possibility that could be envisaged <e>", "<cs> as i explained at the beginning i put forward this proposal rather tentatively <e> <s> it gave rise to an interesting discussion in which the lawyers who contributed to the debate ran very much according to form and said precisely what i expected them to say <e>", "<cs> in my opening remarks i said that i thought that the rule of law had been defined too widely <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon pursued that point <e> <s> however it appears not to arise in connection with my amendment in which i propose to delete the rule of law altogether <e> <s> we seem to have strayed into a discussion on clause stand part <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble earl said <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged for the reception which the bill has received both from the government and from the opposition <e> <s> i should add however a few words of personal explanation <e> <s> as the noble earl said i was the permanent under-secretary of state at the home office at the time the act was going through parliament <e> <s> i cannot claim to have taken a detailed part in every piece of legislation that the home office promoted at that time <e> <s> however i was upset by what was happening in this area in the s and therefore i became quite closely involved personally in the matter and i visited several casinos <e> <s> i believe i can claim to be the only permanent under-secretary of state to have been served with orange juice by a bunny girl at two oclock in the morning <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister is replying to me perhaps he will get the facts right <e> <s> i commented that it was perhaps what the french presidency and the supporters of the charter concluded <e> <s> i did not say that it was the reaction in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an interesting debate <e> <s> as i said at the beginning it has been one-sided although in the past half-hour we have seen the government spokesman doing his best <e> <s> i was very anxious that this should not develop into a party political struggle <e> <s> i was particularly pleased to have the support of a fellow cross-bencher in the admirable speech of my noble friend lord bridges <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that it will not be of much comfort to those who read the announcement in todays papers about increased fares a reduction in services and cuts in investment <e> <s> does the noble viscount agree that it all adds to the risk that people will abandon the railways and instead drive into london probably in a heavily subsidised company car and thereby add to the congestion and pollution on the roads <e> <s> can the minister say whether the government have any overall transport policy affecting journeys into and out of the capital <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to devote my few minutes to two specific issues <e> <s> the first relates to the way in which the poll tax in certain respects interlocks with the social security system <e> <s> those who are poor and also disabled or very old and living on income support will be eligible to claim an per cent <e> <s> rebate <e> <s> although they will have to pay the remaining per cent <e> <s> the personal allowance under income support has been increased to take some account of that liability <e> <s> however that increase relates to the national average and in the current year has been fixed at per year <e> <s> for some reason the increase is slightly less than that for married couples and those under although they do not have to pay any less tax <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene but in view of something which the noble earl said i should like to point out that the earlier riots to which the noble lord lord callaghan referred were just as dangerous and violent as the one which took place last weekend <e> <s> my memory also stretches back to the blackshirt riots which took place in the s <e>", "<cs> my lords while i have always greatly welcomed the prison building programme of the present government i believe there is a danger in the light of what the noble lord lord elton has said of it being thought that absolutely nothing was done until they took office <e> <s> there is a risk of overlooking what was achieved before then <e> <s> i think of such prisons as long lartin and coldingley and of my own appearances before the public accounts committee to explain why they all cost three times as much as was originally estimated <e> <s> it was inadequate but something was done <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that the act specifically lays down that if sanitary conveniences are provided special provision should be made for the disabled so far as is both reasonable and practicable <e> <s> is he aware that that is not being honoured by british rail even at the main london terminal stations <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> i have two supplementary questions <e> <s> first is special provision for individuals charged with offences involving drugs or alcohol widely available <e> <s> my second question concerns bail hostels proper <e> <s> i am not an enthusiast for privatisation in law and order in general <e> <s> however is there not a case for handing over management of these hostels to the private sector <e> <s> i bear in mind that the first experimental bail hostel was financed by a private individual who happened to be a friend of the permanent under-secretary of state of the day and that it was run successfully by a body which had nothing to do with government namely the salvation army <e>", "<cs> as my name is first to the amendment perhaps i may add that the answer <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting debate but to my mind it has been slightly disappointing <e> <s> i thought that the arguments for not accepting the recommendations of griffiths and the select committee might be rather stronger than have emerged so far from the discussions <e>", "<cs> we all know what clause is aimed at <e> <s> however i am still left in some ambiguity <e> <s> the noble baroness argues that it is dangerous to have a specific list <e> <s> but she has not explained why in those circumstances there is a specific list later in the bill dealing with residential nursing accommodation in scotland <e> <s> as she has undertaken to look at the matter again before the report stage i have no intention of pursuing it further now <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to press my amendment at this stage but before report stage we should all like to know a little more about what is in prospect and what is possible <e> <s> i confess that i was a little surprised by the speech of the noble baroness lady oppenheim-barnes <e> <s> far from opening the floodgates it seems to me that we would be closing them <e> <s> there have been too many instances where people running homes have turned out to have unsatisfactory characters and convictions <e> <s> a factual check on their records could only be helpful <e>", "<cs> it is precisely on that point that we require more information before we decide whether to pursue the matter on report <e> <s> certainly i should like to keep the position open <e>", "<cs> i support that entirely <e> <s> one hopes that a list of offences could be drawn up <e> <s> for example a conviction for murder manslaughter blackmail physical cruelty or various types of sexual offences would debar an applicant <e> <s> however a person caught driving without car insurance perhaps would not be excluded but it would be nice to know <e> <s> it is possible that a person with a long string of convictions which are not themselves of great moment would cause one to pause and consider whether he is a suitable person <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support to the amendment which seems to be of considerable importance <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord peston is right in having doubts about the drafting of the amendment <e> <s> it will put an obligation on the local authority to carry out an assessment on request however frivolous or ill founded that may be <e>", "<cs> i was glad to add my name to the amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady carnegy reminded us some time ago that the white paper explained that the great bulk of community care is provided by friends families and neighbours and fiat many carers may need help to be able to manage what can become a heavy burden <e> <s> when we came to read the bill the carer was invisible <e> <s> there was perhaps a chink of light in what we were told earlier when discussing amendment no <e> <s> as <e> <s> it could even be that the government will come forward themselves with an amendment that actually refers to carers <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has been put in to bat on some sticky wickets by the government but to explain why it has taken four years to fail to implement legislation approved by parliament on behalf of the disabled is a task which is beyond a government spokesman <e> <s> i fear that the reply is totally unsatisfactory <e> <s> for one thing the noble baroness lumped in section about which i was not talking but which could certainly involve a great deal of expenditure <e>", "<cs> the point was simply that as there was no provision about it being in writing presumably it need not be in writing <e> <s> we need a provision in the bill as we have it to deal with the specific directions <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister for her reply <e> <s> the debate has turned out to be rather more interesting than i expected <e> <s> i listened with care to the noble lord lord carter who described possible motives to me which certainly were not in my mind <e> <s> i took it as axiomatic that this government in accordance with their normal practice would be taking greater powers for central government <e> <s> that is their well-known philosophy and practice whatever they may say in theory <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord think that the civil service college has achieved the high hopes which were held for it <e> <s> it seemed not to do so in its early days <e> <s> has it become a centre of research in the way that its founders hoped that it might develop <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may begin by thanking the minister for his apology for not writing to me <e> <s> perhaps he could complete it by writing to me on the other point about the poll tax which i raised on the same occasion and on which i have heard nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords to say that i am disappointed in that reply would be putting it mildly <e> <s> i concede immediately that the words at the end of the amendment about having an unsettled way of life are too general <e> <s> they are primarily intended to cover the homeless <e> <s> had the government accepted the approach in principle i should have been happy to draft an alternative which met that problem <e> <s> unfortunately they are not prepared to co-operate in principle on an amendment which has secured support on all sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with that point but having myself behaved in a similar way in the past on more than one occasion perhaps i had better not pursue the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the wide-ranging support from around the chamber for this modest amendment <e> <s> i have two comments to make to the point made by my noble friend lady masham <e> <s> it is not suggested that a previous conviction would necessarily be a bar it is a question of the authority knowing about the conviction and coming to a judgment on whether it would constitute a bar <e>", "<cs> my lords the case for the amendment has been clearly made <e> <s> i wish to say only that mencap is heartily in favour of it <e> <s> we learned with regret the proposal of the government to postpone indefinitely the implementation of section of the act <e> <s> i noted with interest the fact that the select committee in another place has now recommended that the section should be implemented <e> <s> however the proposal contained in the amendment is even better and we hope that the government will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords as my name is down to amendment no <e> <s> b and the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i was glad to add my name to the amendment and i wish to <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is about to leave behind the definition of rural area is it not true that the rural development commission have a definition of rural area <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to disappoint the noble baroness when i say that she has not demonstrated to me at all that the amendment is not required <e> <s> listening to her on this occasion and to government explanations on previous occasions i

mean that they have abandoned the idea of a postponement until this bill and t le children act are operating and have settled down as suggested by the letter sent earlier this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that an assurance on those terms is not worth very much <e> <s> i do not understand why we cannot have a simple statement from the government that when the consultations are completed

brought into force <e> <s> the lives of many people in this country continue to be miserable because of the absence of such powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just point out to the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls that the statute book is littered with requirements for consultation <e> <s> there is no novelty about this proposal <e> <s> i was very disappointed in the reply about the long title

european communities committee of your lordships house <e> <s> the sub-committee will be taking evidence from the department and hopes to report before the recess <e> <s> is it not a good idea to wait until that report is available <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that there is much in the social charter which is perfectly acceptable to this country <e> <s> does he further agree that it would have been much better if we had taken an active part in its preparation and put our difficulties forward instead of more or less standing on the sidelines and then grumbling at what eventually appeared <e>", "<cs> my lords as the mover of the original amendment no <e> <s> i should make a few comments on the decision to reject that amendment while extending the provision in the bill earmarking money for the mentally ill to cover those with drug and alcohol problems <e> <s> it would be churlish to refuse this small extension of the original provision in the bill especially

more attractive if it had extended to the mentally handicapped <e> <s> i was sorry to find reading that part of yesterdays commons proceedings that has appeared in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has put her philosophy most clearly <e> <s> however can she reconcile it with the decision to ring-fence provisions for those who suffer from mental illness and drug and alcohol abuse <e>",
