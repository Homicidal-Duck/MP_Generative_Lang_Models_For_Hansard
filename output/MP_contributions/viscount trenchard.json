["<cs> my lords i do not think i can at this stage except to say that we regard some of the matters in the carter report as having been outstanding for a long while <e> <s> we are aware of the need

achievements in this area and a telecommunications industry that can make a contribution <e> <s> we are well aware of the dangers of taking parts away and leaving a part which is very difficult to run

to be introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not expect such formidable opposition on the first day from the father of the house if i may say so and i do not think i can add to my answer except to say that we will look at all parts of the post office and the telecommunications system the difficult parts and the easy parts and the recommendations will be designed to improve and will not be on any dogmatic basis as i do not believe efficiency is compatible with dogma <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not consider that that point is within the realms of the matters we are

state of industry which i have now had a chance of looking at <e> <s> both need to be improved <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall bear in mind the points that the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is a separate question which the noble lord is fully entitled to table on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure or at least i hope that your lordships will not expect me to be in a position at this stage to make any detailed statement about regional industrial policy or to give details of eligibility for assistance from the european regional development fund <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of study the house might be interested if i were to say and noble lords probably already know this much better than i do that assisted areas in this country cover over per cent <e> <s> of the population area and still there are problems known to us of unemployment pockets and other difficulties outside the area to which i refer relating to per cent <e> <s> of the population <e> <s> with regard to the question of the eligibility for assistance from the european regional development fund i wish to draw my noble friends attention to the fact that under existing rules there is a per cent <e> <s> element called the non-quota section for which inner cities and london would theoretically be eligible but i have already learnt that all quotas and all funds are already being asked for by many different people in the very great part of the united kingdom which is now especially treated <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say that there is no intention of not having a regional policy <e> <s> i will return to that subject when i wind up the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords many of your lordships are experienced in summing up after a debate of this length <e> <s> this is my first

than has been suggested by noble lords opposite <e> <s> it needs a great deal of further consultation including consultation with the city interests which as the noble lord mentioned are very much concerned about this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord says <e> <s> i believe it is going to he extremely difficult to draw the demarcation line even for one small apparently

helpful if before we begin considering the many amendments before us i explain the attitude which the government intend to take towards those amendments which seek to extend the scope of the bill beyond that necessary to accommodate the eec second directive in a sensible way into our existing body of law <e> <s> i recognise that as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones pointed out during the second reading debate the long title of the bill is widely drawn and therefore might be thought to encourage wide-ranging amendments <e> <s> i also recognise that some of the amendments which have been put down represent useful and indeed overdue measures of company law reform which are not controversial either in substance or indeed in method <e> <s> in that category i would put the improvement of the position of minority shareholders and the revision of penalties neither of which subjects incidentally was discussed in standing committee in another place during consideration of the previous administrations bill <e> <s> but the matters which were covered in parts iv and v of the bill and which were debated at length in another place require further study before the government

make clear as my noble friend lord cullen was going to do in replying to the points on this amendment that amendments nos <e> <s> and are the two amendments which we plan to accept with the leave of the committee <e> <s> but we shall wish to speak to the detail of clause and clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> first may say that if i have not met the point raised just now by my noble friend on the interpretation of clause <e> <s> we shall try to make it clear to him between now and report stage <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord like to explain that point before i reply <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that we could deal with these amendments and i am grateful to the noble lord for moving them all together in such a way as to shortern time by dealing with them in a brief way but i feel i must reply to a number of points he made some of which he made on second reading and additional ones he made today and then i will reply to the points made by the noble lords lord murray of gravesend and lord lloyd of kilgerran <e>", "<cs> there was a survey quoted in committee in the other place that had been done by michael moran who studied post office workers in london in <e> <s> it was mentioned there

industrialist with experience would confirm that a number of forms are signed when an employee joins a company and that they are not read with care and he is in <e> <s> while i accept he can contract out and that theoretically at least nobody will know he has contracted out the atmosphere on the shop floor is such that he is in whether or not he knew it and he would certainly need some of the courage which my noble friend lady hornsby-smith mentioned to consider contracting out <e>", "<cs> first i want to make it clear that i am not recommending anything in relation to trade unions <e> <s> i have in fact already pointed out there have been several mentions of the matter in the debate that the comparison between trade unions and companies is not appropriate <e> <s> at the moment i am dealing with the question of whether the movers of the amendment are really wishing to protect the shareholder in view of the other side of the picture in so far as one can compare involving comparisons between the pressures on employees tacit or automatic and the pressures on companies <e>", "<cs> i did not suggest that it would be illegal <e> <s> i said it would have to have the permission of an annual general meeting <e>", "<cs> may i say one thing <e> <s> i did say that i did not doubt for a moment the sincerity of the movers of these amendments but i said that i found that

mentioned <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> to and no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i think i am right in saying that this is the first time that the noble lord lord mishcon has spoken from the front bench opposite <e> <s> may i congratulate him on the much greater clarity that he commands than anything which i or indeed many members of your lordships house can possibly command and also on the way in which he put his points <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord has correctly quoted the jenkins report <e> <s> i am also clear that the fact that very little has been done in a considerable number of years is not entirely the fault of this administration <e> <s> furthermore once again we believe that the point quoted by the noble lord namely the reconciliation of a new definition of directors duties with the common law needs to be thought through further <e> <s> when the noble lord gets his opportunity when we come to the bill he will find that this subject will be treated in a way which we <e>", "<cs> this amendment no <e> <s> has been moved and for all the reasons i gave on the last occasion i would advise the committee not to accept it <e> <s> the question of

on this subject that a situation where a company is taking account only of its shareholders does not reflect the reality of the present situation <e> <s> i should like to make that publicly clear <e>

work in a thoroughly co-operative manner and they will not do that unless they believe that their interests are being taken care of <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will check the <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could say to the noble lord lord mishcon that it is neither our opinion nor our advice including advice from people who know a great deal about this subject that these are matters which can be easily dealt with between the committee and report stages <e> <s> we have tabled with remarkable alacrity and with the concessions which i have today given after receiving the authority of the government so to give a very great part of the companies bill of the last administration which it took them quite a long time to table <e> <s> the clauses which we hold back are sincerely held back because we believe that they can be improved <e> <s> i hope both in relation to this amendment and to future amendments that our sincerity on this point will be accepted <e>", "<cs> i would assure the noble lord that we shall study the implications of the fourth directive in relation to this issue very carefully indeed <e> <s> we have spoken at length in relation to this subject of loans and i will not detain the committee but merely say that i hope in view of what has already been said and the assurance that i have just given the noble lord will not press this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should

by saying that he had noted my belief in the opinions of <e>", "<cs> it is indeed quite possible that when we bring in the proposals in some respects they will be stronger in dealing with the evil <e>

i hope he will accept rather than restate what he has made clear to us already that our view is that there is a real risk of doing damage to the desirable function of the market in probing for real information which is available and making it more widely known <e> <s> as many people have said when arguing the previous clause this needs further time <e> <s> i hope that we can avoid a misunderstanding or a repeat of arguments on it <e>", "<cs> may i suggest that if our two contenders wish to continue we should adopt tie-breaking rule as at wimbledon <e>", "<cs> as usual i agree with the philosophy the noble viscount outlined that the best can be the enemy of the good but i have seen a large number of episodes many of them in very recent legislation where situations can be made worse <e>", "<cs> it is my recommendation that the committee accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> as i have already said the government accept this amendment and recommend that the committee should do likewise <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could make one matter clear <e> <s> when the committee stage started this afternoon i said that we would accept amendments <e>", "<cs> if we find that this has to apply to biscuit tins i will take the noble lords point on board <e> <s> but i believe it to be true that the companies concerned will not have to alter their biscuit tins or milk bottle tops <e>", "<cs> my recommendation is that the committee should accept this amendment <e> <s> i am not entirely clear about the procedure as to how we get schedule moved in the way that the noble lord lord bruce of donington suggests <e>", "<cs> i assure the noble lord that i will consider his point <e>", "<cs> i confess to being not content and also to being lost <e> <s> if i have to do so i shall promise to go back and look at it but i understand this to be part of a subject which we have not agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct to remind us of the views of what he terms the most responsible and senior committee in another place and of the fact that this matter has been going on for some time <e> <s> it is indeed a question of priorities <e> <s> the duties of the comptroller and auditor-general in general are being looked at but as my noble friend knows well the whole role of the neb is being considered <e> <s> in that context we need to get entirely clear and agreed the role of the neb before we announce the results of this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that observation <e> <s> we are fully aware of the <e>", "<cs> my lords in our review of the neb the noble lords views have been expressed clearly and in considerable detail to us <e> <s> we have taken into account and will continue to take into account until the moment of decision all views which are expressed on the past role of the neb <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated we have said that we will continue the review started by the previous administration which goes into the role of the comptroller and auditor-general not only in relation to the neb but in relation to other matters as well <e> <s> but if i may say so i think there is relevance in my previous answers in that to submit in haste to a new procedure in relation to its accounts a body whose role is being discussed in major degree is not an entirely sensible procedure either <e> <s> but both these bodies and i am sorry to disappoint my noble friends are under review <e> <s> the importance of the point raised in the original question by my noble friend is fully accepted by the government and will be taken into account and we hope to announce the result shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords all i would say rather than repeat what i said earlier is that we have not been looking at it for very long and i think the two subjects are connected <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish my previous answers in any way to mean that the government do not accept that the neb should be responsible to procedures of scrutiny which will satisfy parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that there is to be a debate i will try to be as brief as i can in replying to the many points that have been raised <e> <s> first i should like just to say that my right honourable friend the secretary of state was extremely conscious as we all <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his endorsement with which he started his question <e> <s> in relation to the idcs it might be worth my mentioning that over several years now under the previous administration and i am in no way criticising over applications have been received every year and the refusals in the end have been under <e> <s> that was the highest figure and there were fives and sixes in recent years <e> <s> so that you have an enormous administrative system for very little <e> <s> it is against an analysis of that system that we have concluded that we should keep control only of the really big projects in areas where employment is still and there are not so many areas relatively full <e> <s> in regard to inward investment the sentiments which my noble <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we have looked very carefully at the job losses and i do not think when the noble lord reads the statement that he will feel that we overweighted the emphasis on savings <e> <s> i have set that against the absolute need of national economics and the recovery of british industry nationally <e> <s> we have never pretended that the steps in the budget did not cost something <e> <s> we believe that they will be effective and that a regional policy can be effective only within an effective national policy <e> <s> so far as job losses are concerned we have looked at this long and deep <e> <s> we have read the papers and works and surveys of people within and without the government and i will certainly return to this subject in the debate <e> <s> i think it is highly arguable as to what the net gain has in fact been <e> <s> there are some very depressing statistics and very depressing situations where jobs are still being lost mainly in the extremely difficult areas where we are <e>", "<cs> my lords we of course examined the effect of this policy within the national policy and we believe that we shall turn around the industrial decline <e>", "<cs> and the rising unemployment that we have inherited and turn it into an upward movement <e> <s> how do you estimate forward one part of a major policy when you inherit the situation that we have inherited <e> <s> i will return to this subject in the debate <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i do not think anybody in this country or anywhere else would like that rate to last any longer than is necessary <e> <s> i shall not go into the reasons again which have been expressed in your lordships house by my noble friends in economic debates as to why we found it necessary to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i will say briefly once again that we do not anticipate that these changes of policy will have anything other taken together than a beneficial effect on employment and that includes the regional element in it <e> <s> i must remind the noble lord the leader of the opposition that when the previous administration cut the regional employment premium in they cut it by million over per cent <e> <s> of the current expenditure on regional industrial policy <e> <s> what notice did they give <e> <s> two weeks notice <e> <s> an announcement on th december took affect on nd january <e> <s> did they give us an estimate of the number of jobs that would be lost by that much greater measure at no notice at the drop of a hat <e> <s> no they did not <e> <s> we are putting in an orderly and effective reform to save waste and have a much more cost-effective regional programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i will return to the detail of industries on which i have some statistics when we come to the debate <e> <s> of course we intend to improve on the record of the last government and a mixture of a one-year to three-year transition period during which a lot of other policies will come to fruition will be a very large help <e>", "<cs> my lords after a visit to brussels last week and in addition continuous negotiations between officials and the officials of the commission i can assure the noble baroness that there is no risk whatsoever in the next two years of our losing our share of the eec regional or social funds <e> <s> furthermore i found in brussels that the commissioner responsible for regional policy is also adopting a policy of concentration <e> <s> he believes that it will be beneficial to concentrate aid in areas of real need <e> <s> so there appears to be in the longer term a convergence of view <e> <s> we do not believe that there will be any shortage of projects in the next two years to prevent us from taking up our full whack <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i will just reply to some of the points that the noble lord lord melchett has raised as best i can at this stage which is only to a limited extent and then deal particularly with the point that the noble lord lord rochester has just raised <e> <s> i do not think that mentions of the politics of envy really have any place and i am prepared to say in either direction in this case <e> <s> we hold a sincere view which we published quite clearly in the manifesto that industry will be most efficiently run with the least bill on the taxpayer and the maximum creation of wealth for the nation as a whole by maximising private enterprise <e> <s> we stick to that and we believe it to be in the interests of the whole nation <e> <s> on the financial duties the bill which my right honourable friends statement mentioned will of course spell those out <e> <s> the commercial discipline on the board will of course remain <e> <s> other than that and the mentions of the short-term financial questions which i have repeated in the statement i cannot today add <e>", "<cs> my lords neither i nor anybody else will be surprised that the government disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> lord balogh although we agree with him that industrial decline has been accelerating and that it is still accelerating <e> <s> that is why we have spelled out in every economic debate since we took office which was only a short time ago that real change is necessary that the policies of the past have failed and that the decline has accelerated <e> <s> that is also why we have introduced totally new conditions which are not only known and proved to have been conducive to the growth of industry in many other countries but which will again be proved to be conducive to real growth in this country <e> <s> that is why furthermore the policies which we are introducing which will result in gradual change not in change at a stroke or in an abrupt way will be more successful than those which have been practised until recently with such obvious failure <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to repeat what i have already said <e> <s> certainly we acknowledge that outside the house the current role of the neb has been described as a hospital role <e> <s> i should he repeating myself if i went back over the economic conditions which may have produced a rather large number of hospital cases <e> <s> but we shall continue the hospital role <e> <s> we shall seek to minimise that role and we hope and believe that the general economic conditions will lead to less patients or as my right honourable friend has said to the very occasional patient <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe it is irresponsible for us to come to parliament at this stage and it is certainly not irresponsible not to disclose now the kind of figures that we believe this reduced role of the neb will require <e> <s> it is not correct to suggest that the government have not even begun to work out these reductions <e> <s> we are going to work closely with the neb which the noble lord is always advocating that we should do over the details leading up to the preparation of the bill and for us to announce figures before that had been done and before

noble baroness lady seear and the noble lord lord melchett are concerned about the maintenance of the efficiency of the industry and its morale <e> <s> i should like to draw the attention of the noble lord lord melchett to what was said by my right honourable friend in his statement <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords let me just comment on the question put by the noble lord lord balogh <e> <s> we

the country have to be considered against the actual time when this plan is <e>", "<cs> my lords i would refer the noble lord lord wigg to my right honourable friends statement in which he said that in the years ahead the industry will generate large internal funds but that substantial external funds will also be required <e> <s> i do not think i can sensibly add to that <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that at the present time there is too big an ambit of government in industry <e>", "<cs> and we believe that government in so far as it can be efficient in industry will be more efficient

"<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord for not commenting on his point on civil aircraft projects <e> <s> it is our view that an independent company operating at arms length and british

reason to believe that there will be a completely even-handed treatment and that the eec thus will be playing a positive role in relation to minimising this great problem and preventing too great a degree of tax-payers money escalating in all countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i must leave that as a wider subject for another day <e> <s> certainly in relation to regional policy we are in close touch to ensure that we use all the funds available to us from the eec <e> <s> the question of larger regional funds and larger contributions to the eec is i think a separate subject which we should not enter into today <e>", "<cs> my lords since this is my department i should like to say to all your lordships that i am very sorry <e> <s> the only other comment that i will make is that the policy has not been rushed although the document may have been so <e> <s> i apologise for the one date which was in error and for the undoubted inconvenience to all noble lords and particularly those who were to take part in the debate <e> <s> i am very sorry indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords a great number of questions have been asked which i shall not refer to tonight but i have pages of notes on them and a number of them are serious questions and i will write to the noble lords concerned and give them detailed answers otherwise i shall be speaking for an unacceptable length of time having already made a long opening statement <e>", "<cs> my lords the first thing i want to make clear is that nobody on these benches is against the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have mentioned before that noble lords on the opposite side of the house cut a bigger sum off the regional employment premium at two weeks notice <e> <s> noble lords opposite did it because they were forced to do it because reality dawned for a moment <e> <s> that is the first point that i want to make the total lack of reality in many of the comments made by noble lords opposite in terms of the current situation <e> <s> the suggestion is that the position in the regions is the only thing to have declined to tragic proportions <e> <s> i have visited them all and i agree the tragic proportions but do not let us forget the national position with a rise of unemployment during the trusteeship of noble lords opposite from to <e> <s> do not let us forget that this nation industrially is on the brink of the precipice and what we are trying to do is to prevent the nation from taking one step forward <e> <s> we must change direction and here i say to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby cuts of themselves do not of course force growth <e> <s> we have tried to create conditions which have been found here and elsewhere across the globe as being capable of lifting standards of living nationally well beyond our present level which but for oil would have sunk beyond belief <e> <s> therefore we have to take our national policy and our regional policy together <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a subjective element in this and there are many factors which have to be taken into account in each area <e> <s> the previous administration found and we agree with them completely on this point that they really are not capable of publication without an enormous amount of argument about each and every area <e> <s> what one tries to do here is to make sure that the criteria which a very efficient civil service are working on are objective overall and having done that one must leave it to them and in order to interpret it as fairly as possible keep all political decision out of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly say to my noble friend that the small firm aspect of this problem is uppermost in my mind and that it has priority <e> <s> i should pay tribute to the previous administration for starting an interdepartmental review of statistical <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that there is no question that in cutting down the quantity and sometimes the frequency of statistical forms one is to a very small degree and that has been our guiding light that it is only to a very small degree affecting the statistical accuracy of the final results as presented but if one uses all modern techniques and examines ones sample properly i am convinced that we can go considerably further <e> <s> i think i should put this in perspective by saying that the saving of a million forms relates to million forms on the statistical side not on the administrative side where there are many more forms and that according to the thickness of the paper if we piled them on top of each other i believe they would be considerably higher than big ben <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not part of the governments intention nor their achievement <e> <s> the worsening of the situation has at this stage still far more to do with the incredible position we inherited than with anything we have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for mentioning retail shops <e> <s> of the total number of forms i have mentioned forms have been saved by abandoning plans to hold a retail shops inquiry in <e> <s> so far as administrative forms are concerned this is a more difficult problem and must follow a policy as to what the government administer and what they do not <e> <s> in this respect and not included in my total we have of course already made a small contribution <e> <s> the price commission no longer sends forms a few came from exchange control and while we have been criticised for it our more effective but narrower regional policy will also involve fewer forms <e>", "<cs> my lords i think sir derek rayners sponsored inquiries have already shown their worth <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords under their present trading agreements with the eec greece spain and portugal that is all the aspiring members are entitled to unrestricted access to the communitys markets for textile products <e> <s> however at present all three countries are restraining their exports to the community within agreed limits on a voluntary basis <e> <s> the treaty of accession which has already been signed with greece includes a reciprocal safeguard clause which would allow the commission to authorise action against disruptive imports during the transitional period <e> <s> that transitional period for greece is five years <e> <s> we feel that the safeguard clause is in itself not a wholly satisfactory way of dealing with the problem and we shall be seeking alternatives in the negotiations with portugal and spain <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly intend as my right honourable friends said in the other place yesterday in the debate on the textile industry to investigate all allegations of unfair trading and to help in any way we can to ensure that competition for this industry is on a fair basis <e>", "<cs> my lords in the case of the countries of which we are speaking they are generally regarded as being low-cost countries <e> <s> i am not aware of them being used as so to speak intermediate points as has been alleged in the case of mauritius <e> <s> we are looking into that <e> <s> i am not aware of anything on those lines <e> <s> to put the matter in perspective here and i appreciate that from the textile industrys point of view it is the accumulation of small increases in imports that worries them the figures for imports from greece and portugal were each per cent <e> <s> of the total imports into the united kingdom <e> <s> in the case of spain the figure was per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords we are confident that on a fair competitive basis both of those sections of the industry which are large and very important will continue to have a major part to play <e> <s> it is not for government to ensure at any cost or by unilateral protection that the exact size or shape of any section of industry should be maintained <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord for those very interesting points <e> <s> we agree entirely with much of what he said about the efficiency and adaptability that have been shown by the textile industry in recent years but this is an age of change and that has to go on <e> <s> i do not think it is the moment to go into the wider questions he raises <e> <s> if i may return to the limited question with one final remark which i hope your lordships will not regard as flippant i tried to look into the degree to which the voluntary agreements in relation to the three countries which are the subject of the question today have been effective <e> <s> i can really find only two instances of any major difficulty <e> <s> the latest one over which we are still negotiating is in relation to imports of spanish under-pants which are well above their agreed voluntary level <e> <s> her majestys government are looking at every possible way of lowering the level of imports of spanish pants <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked that question and my office does not know <e> <s> i think in civil service terms pants can also be panties <e>", "<cs> my lords a very large number of points have been <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal in a moment if i may with the continuing role of the neb <e> <s> we very much hope that the trade unions and we are aware of the statements made to which the noble baroness refers will when the dust is settled if i may use a colloquial phrase see that the government have taken a perfectly proper decision on a difficult and immediate large-scale organisational problem <e> <s> i hope and my right honourable friend hopes that when they do appreciate that that is the situation some of them will in the future play their part on the basis of their particular contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i too cannot remember what the third point was but the first point was not about the trade unions themselves <e> <s> he criticised certain trade union attitudes but without reference to his speech i could not recall them <e> <s> so far as this subject is concerned if i may say so to the noble baroness we are talking about an impasse situation which arose between two great <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal briefly with those three points <e> <s> i personally believe that for those who like to ask questions in parliament the removal of an intermediary is in fact an advantage <e> <s> but i must make clear that just as in the case of the nationalised industries at the moment a very great number of questions usually refer to the management of the operation and the answer that may well be given is that that is a matter for rolls-royce just as the answer very often is for example that is a matter for the british steel corporation so i do not think the question and answer position will change we can answer questions only on those matters for which we are responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords the legal position at the moment as i understand it is that there has to be an neb <e> <s> that is why when my right honourable friend was given no option by a declared intention on th november of the entire board to resign he was obliged in law to take steps to make sure that the neb which has certain legal functions continued with its work some of which is extremely urgent <e> <s> that he has done <e> <s> what he mentioned in his statement was that once the industry bill has gone through this house and becomes law at that point in time he will in fact require the neb to transfer the shares in rolls-royce to him as secretary of state <e> <s> this is something which he will by then on the assumption that the bill is passed have the power to do <e> <s> that will be done in the future <e> <s> so far as the civil servants and their abilities are concerned i am quite satisfied as to their ability with the full qualifications and credentials that they have to carry out the role that the government retain <e> <s> the management of rolls-royce i have to say once again will be controlled by the highly efficient board which sir frank mcfadzean takes over <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to give the noble lord the answer to that question later <e> <s> i deliberately asked for information on this point and the information that i have been given does not give that time limit <e> <s> but if i am wrong i will not only let the noble lord know but take steps to try to inform other noble lords who are interested particularly the noble lord lord allen <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the question of my noble friend lord drumalbyn i am sure that that is correct that the select committee will scrutinise the draft directive and that there will be opportunities for debate <e> <s> my box has just sent me a note <e> <s> i think that i am correct <e> <s> there is no period of months from now <e> <s> what the noble lord lord mishcon may have in mind is that a directive such as this comes into force months after agreement and most of what i have described to him are the stages coming up to agreement <e> <s> perhaps that makes the position as clear as one can in dealing with a difficult estimation <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank all noble lords who have made valuable contributions to this debate <e> <s> all the points that they have made will be very carefully studied <e> <s> as i become a little less green i am gradually learning that one cannot deal with all the points raised in a debate without being too long <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord bruce of donington for supporting the bill on behalf of the party opposite <e> <s> indeed all speakers have wished the bill the speediest possible passage <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of croy mentioned the urgency of the matter so i am indeed grateful for the assurance that the bill will be speeded on its way <e>", "<cs> my lords having read the figures many times perhaps i could confirm that to the noble viscount after the debate <e> <s> at the moment i am of the belief that this does not include the construction of naval vessels <e> <s> if i am wrong i may have an opportunity to correct it but i see that my adviser in the box is nodding so that may speed up the process <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can clear the matter up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i must read the press much more <e> <s> the point at issue is that british shipbuilders have recently assured my honourable friend and colleague the minister of state mr butler that they are on course to stay within their cash and loss limits for <e> <s> the next point raised by my noble friend lord campbell was whether it was true that the previous spend before we got the intervention fund going again was only one-fifth of million <e> <s> indeed the sum that was spent was million <e> <s> to that extent we have already got the intervention fund support for this industry really under control negotiated and going at a faster and a slightly higher level than was the case before we came to power <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement runs <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank both noble lords for the points which they have made <e> <s> perhaps i could start by saying that the government are neither curtailing nor abolishing this experiment <e> <s> the experiment stems from a joint agreement which was negotiated by the parties concerned <e> <s> it was negotiated for a two year period as an experiment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for making that point <e> <s> i am sure that in the future the house will have a number of opportunities to discuss the role of boards and the problems of the representation of different <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that question <e> <s> the first thing i should like to say is that the government and the post office board this was in the statement are deeply indebted for the dedicated and unpaid efforts of the trade union members on the post office board for the period of this experiment <e> <s> i want to make it quite clear that this is our view and we are grateful for the efforts that they have put in <e>", "<cs> my lords i will first say to the noble baroness that neither here in this case nor in my experience of continental countries which is considerable do the government operate this or not in industrial areas <e> <s> it is operated by the companies and industries concerned <e> <s> with regard to why this experiment has not succeeded and why our pattern is very different from the continent one has to look at the whole picture <e> <s> they have a highly developed joint consultation system often backed by law but they also have a closely regulated trade union system within a very definite legal framework and as in many areas one countrys experience based on its whole background history and way of dealing with things is not a blueprint copy for another country <e> <s> i certainly know however that important industries in this country both nationalised and private-sector have experience and have studied in great detail the continental practices and that that is part of their background for trying to improve the many areas that need improvement in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friends statement made clear in the main the worker <e>", "<cs> my lords it is extremely difficult to get a clear picture of the quantity of outward processing and certainly not broken down between manufacturers and retailers or wholesalers i am speaking of course of europe as a whole <e> <s> however it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that piece of information of which i was not aware <e> <s> i shall immediately try to check it but my impression is that germany is very definitely not one of those countries in favour of tying the use of outward processing quotas to specific manufacturers <e> <s> if i am wrong on that i shall let the house know on a future occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as i can understand it it means that you send british cloth or british materials abroad to a country where costs are cheaper where the cloth is made up into clothing of one kind or another <e> <s> it is then imported back into this country or for that matter into any other eec country if this method is practised by them <e>", "<cs> my lords the work on this proposed regulation started in february of this year and we hope that it will come to fruition in the very early part of next year <e>", "<cs> my lords there are artful dodgers <e> <s> i do not think the world is completely full of them and some of them live in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the report of the select committee as always in this area has been extremely valuable and if i recall correctly one of its main points was that this country must include outward processing as though it were imports within all existing quotas and restraints <e> <s> that indeed is the policy and the practice of her majestys government <e> <s> so far as the mfa is concerned i think that is another question <e> <s> my right honourable friend has made clear that forms of restraint and regulation must continue after the end of the present mfa <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for those supplementary questions <e> <s> the planning position is one on which we are certainly interested to receive views and have already received views from all concerned <e> <s> we believe that discouragement has not only centred around the planning situation <e> <s> there is more than one opinion whether the planning stage in exploration should be treated on its own or as part of a possible final exploration <e> <s> we are looking at this closely <e> <s> as far as leaving the resources in the ground is concerned i believe that we have enough resources to develop the minerals that we need in the shorter term <e> <s> i believe that the balance of the programme is about right <e> <s> if some of our mineral resources are to stay in the ground successors may be happy <e> <s> we believe that the necessary degree of exploration will continue with the funds that we are supplying <e>", "<cs> my lords those are largely separate questions but as to the fact that the steel industry has considerable problems it could be in your lordships opinion that this is because the problems have not been adequately faced in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i will look into that question and let the noble earl know <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said i think the decisions as to the installation of new smelting capacity must be mainly commercial <e> <s> if installations were undertaken in our assisted areas at the moment and if the criteria of additionality to gtp which are the new criteria were to apply and i think they would considerable assistance is available <e> <s> i do not think that one can go further than that <e> <s> one must recognise that smelting is usually done where the minerals are dug <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord lee of newton and the noble lord lord byers for their contributions with the one exception of the last contribution of the noble lord lord lee <e> <s> i am sure that he will agree with me that the last thing any of us on any side want to do is to widen an area of dispute <e> <s> i therefore must refute very strongly indeed any idea that this government has picked on steel <e> <s> that is far removed from the truth <e> <s> even mr bill sirs and others i am glad to say said after the weekend talks that they were quite clear that this strike had no political motivation <e> <s> it has <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course aware as is the whole house that this is the first steel strike since <e> <s> my right honourable friend who knows mr sirs i do not know him personally is convinced of his integrity <e> <s> we are well aware that as the noble lord put it mr sirs is considered a moderate <e> <s> regarding other steel industries noble lords are a little out-of-date <e> <s> there is substantial improvement going on in the german french and dutch steel industry <e> <s> the german industry is quite definitely in the black <e> <s> i am well aware of the point about coking coal <e> <s> i am also aware of the prices at which coking coal is purchased by companies in these countries <e> <s> taking all these matters into consideration there is no burking the issue that our productivity is the main reason for this problem <e> <s> that is why the right honourable gentleman mr eric varley set the target of break-even by march of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that the causes of low productivity are many and indeed the management and the unions of this industry have been into them on many occasions <e> <s> the problem is that the identification of those many and complicated causes has not led to effective action <e> <s> i am not blaming anyone i am stating a fact <e> <s> i will not follow the noble lord hack before the first war because he knows that while he has educated me on a number of historical figures i cannot follow him back in detail on this <e> <s> we are not saying either that management is perfect or that trade unions are perfect <e> <s> what we are saying is that after many joint studies targets have been declared by the previous administration and by ourselves and it is now up to the two combined to implement those targets <e>", "<cs> my lords if am not to lose track of the important points which the noble lord lord shin-well raised as well as those raised by my noble friend lord amory may i say that every industry has special circumstances and every department of government and national service always has special circumstances <e> <s> the combination of those special circumstances and the meeting of them beyond the resources of the nation in order to secure a settlement has been <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not so familiar as the noble baroness with the original statute but on the assumption that she is accurate as usual and that the object was to break even taking one year with another it is worth recording that a cash limit of million to accommodate losses of million was required for the current financial year which is not yet over <e> <s> so that by no stretch of the imagination can it be said that british steel has in recent years been breaking even one year with another <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly my feeling <e> <s> in my view all those involved in this dispute in british steel the union leaders and the management are reasonable and solid englishmen some with very great experience <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and scotsmen too for all i know and welshmen <e> <s> i appeal to all both inside and outside this house to restrain from blame-awarding and the like <e> <s> i shall not deal with the points made by my noble friend as this discussion has gone on for a long while and his last two are really for british steel to deal with not for me <e> <s> however may i deal very quickly with one point which was raised by the noble lord lord wigg <e> <s> he asked what i expect british steel to do with it if they get higher productivity do i expect them to eat it <e> <s> no i do not <e> <s> i am aware of the harshness of what i am about to say <e> <s> if however one has a situation in which an industry or a company is not competitive it has first to become competitive before it can hope to increase its market share <e> <s> we have to do that first in british steel <e> <s> when there is a backlog such as this because things have been allowed to become noncompetitive i am aware that it involves redundancies which are already necessarily high but which were not faced up to by the previous administration though the request to face up to them was made by that administration <e> <s> however the redundancies were not faced up to by the previous administration and they have to be faced up to now <e> <s> as soon as they are faced up to there is a very good chance that the market share will start to increase and as and when world economic activity begins to increase british steel will be well placed <e>", "<cs> my lords they stand for english industrial estates corporation which i think most noble lords will know about and which undertakes the government factory building programme in the assisted areas <e> <s> i am sorry i have got into the jargon habit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to follow my noble friend in answering a hypothetical question which we do not believe will become a real question <e> <s> we do not believe it because not every nation has used a compulsory method <e> <s> my noble friend himself mentioned the situation in relation to american motor cars <e> <s> he knows that in america they have adopted a voluntary system <e> <s> my information is that in his dialogue with the noble lord lord monson he was correct in saying that they had transferred completely and voluntarily on all important matters regarding motor cars <e> <s> this has been done under a voluntary system <e>", "<cs> you need a timetable for that as the noble lord rightly says and a timetable can be arranged in more than one way <e> <s> we are talking of the completion of certain segments that have not converted to which i shall come in a moment <e> <s> in the past when i have been in industry i have often complained that government have set dates for particular changeovers which may be right for one section of the industry and are quite wrong for the other and in my view i have been right <e> <s> what my right honourable friend and i suggest and suggest to the trades associations both manufacturing and retail is that the remainder of the completion should be the subject not just <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last occasion when a statement was made we nearly ran into a full-length debate and i shall try very hard to avoid doing so today <e> <s> the assessment of the value of lost production within bsc has been suggested by bsc as being of the order of million sterling per week <e> <s> that is an estimate because it depends on the second point which the noble lord the leader of the opposition raised namely the level and the contraction of demand <e> <s> however that is bscs estimate <e> <s> outside bsc as yet the loss is extremely small and as the statement says steel users have not yet felt any appreciable loss at all <e> <s> nevertheless my right honourable friend has made it clear that very severe repercussions will develop in the future if the dispute continues <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall attend to my omissions here and communicate with the leader of the opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer that question because it is hypothetical but in relation to unemployment benefit and supplementary benefit within the industry and taking into account people outside the industry altogether some figures have already been mentioned the bill will continue to rise <e> <s> however british steel is now equipped <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has mentioned two points <e> <s> the second point i believe i have already fully answered and i have nothing further to add <e> <s> in relation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the bill with its four main elements is an essential component of the governments overall economic strategy <e> <s> its very title indicates not only the central features of the bill but also the importance attached by the government to a strong and effective competition policy <e> <s> we believe in competition rather than control <e>", "<cs> my lords under each of these schemes considerable benefits have been paid <e> <s> under the readaptation benefits scheme for instance in so far the commission has allocated million to shotton workers <e> <s> some applications have been successfully submitted since we joined the community in <e> <s> in relation to the reconversion loans we are currently and have been throughout receiving some per cent <e> <s> of the total ecsc budget and over million worth of loans since the exchange risk cover scheme was introduced in have been negotiated <e> <s> twenty five million pounds have already been paid <e> <s> in relation to the training schemes we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that any community source has actually offered jobs abroad <e> <s> within the community there is of course freedom of movement of labour today and a lot of british people are working on the continent <e> <s> i have no idea how many redundant steelworkers may have taken their own initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer that very quickly <e> <s> as i said my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer is no longer requesting the neb to make a contribution in this financial year of million <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement which my right honourable friend the secretary of state has made in the other place <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to deal at this stage if i may with the points made by the noble lord lord bruce and the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> as regards protracted negotiations i think the noble lord lord bruce was really saying that this had taken a long time <e> <s> indeed it has taken a long time but international negotiations do and it was not until the end of september that we had real figures from the industry particularly relating to the american feedstock side of things on which to commence detailed negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we are dealing rather more with the modern conservative philosophy which believes in giving enough time for the readjustment of industry to which the noble baroness lady seear referred and which also deals with situations where there is strong evidence that our industry does not face fair competition <e> <s> in this respect the feedstock and energy prices have had a major bearing in this subject being raised with europe and the protection we have asked for <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be the wish of the house that i should deal by correspondence with the second two points raised by the noble lord lord hale which do not refer to the united states <e> <s> however let me just tell the house with regard to subsidiaries overseas in the british situation any imports are taken as counting fully against any quota that exists so it does not matter whom they are made by and any imports even outward-processed imports will count as imports within the quota <e> <s> perhaps i could deal with the other questions by writing to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the point made by the noble lord lord spens is very relevant and my right honourable friend the secretary of state has taken full note and has discussed with our friends both in the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raises another technical avenue which we considered in relation to taking action in this area <e> <s> more than the question of feedstock energy is involved <e> <s> we decided that the better course for the immediate protection of the industry and the threatened damage to it was article and since the rest of the community were not prepared to back this action this automatically meant quotas rather than tariffs <e> <s> that is a technical explanation <e> <s> i bear in mind very strongly what my noble friend said in relation to the theory of the position but i think that we adopted the correct tactical route <e>", "<cs> my lords the main reasons for this are not connected with tariffs or protection <e> <s> they have to do with language with the efficiency of the british distribution system and in terms of the products concerned with the particular applicability <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord robbins is quite correct <e> <s> this was one of the factors outside the feedstock question which led us to take the particular route that we have taken <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords that i did not deal with that matter directly <e> <s> i mentioned it just now <e> <s> we have not been able to get support from other eec countries <e> <s> sometimes i worry a little about the current state of development of the eec in terms of understanding that different questions affect different countries with greater severity <e> <s> i know that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade has this point very much in mind and with goodwill in the future i hope that we shall all be more attentive to problems which affect each other <e> <s> there are cases in the reverse direction it would be wrong to go into them in detail at this stage and there are industries where we no longer have a stake where european industries still do and where very often we are advocating a freer increase of imports of cheap goods into britain which we can then of course recirculate to europe <e>", "<cs> my lords let me begin by saying that i recognise the great sincerity with which everyone who has taken part in this debate has spoken <e> <s> nevertheless i marvel along with my right honourable friend at the degree of certainty which noble lords and baronesses in the labour party have expressed that central policies carried out either by themselves or as we are discussing mainly this afternoon by their agencies are the answer to the appalling difficulties that the country and british industry are in today <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not abolishing the neb <e> <s> we leave it with the mammoth task of having some companies already and with roles to help others in the situations which i have described and which are in the guidelines <e> <s> in all conscience in my view that is as much as any high-powered organisation stands a chance of making a real success of <e>", "<cs> my lords the major reason for the power to transfer is in relation to the rolls-royce case where the secretary of states intention has already been announced and which will come into operation on the enactment of this bill and possibly in relation to british leyland in the terms of which i spoke in my introductory speech <e> <s> no other contemplations are in mind but when altering legislation we do not believe that situations remain forever constant <e> <s> therefore for the two cases concerned one of which is certain and the other being tentative we certainly need these powers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has raised a different point <e> <s> the first point which we were <e>", "<cs> may i at this stage get a word in edgeways <e> <s> we are on opposite routes to the party opposite in terms of trying to control inflation <e> <s> to rely on competition and to make sure that competition works is the object of the bill and is thus the reason for the abolition of the price commission <e> <s> there are put in its place some very extensive powers to ensure that competition really works <e> <s> these are opposites <e> <s> i too have spent some years in industry with price control and without price control and i know very well that when there is a price commission operating one talks more to competitors and one gets in applications <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may intervene for one second <e> <s> if i may say so i think we are going over the same ground <e> <s> i do not doubt the noble lord on the million <e> <s> this is the difference between the applications put in and the price increases granted <e> <s> i would just ask him can he account to me please for the reason why since the announcement that the price commission was to be abolished the overall profit margins already abysmally low in industry have in fact reduced and reduced substantially rather than gone up <e> <s> this is quite separate from the question which the noble baroness raises about prices rising <e>", "<cs> that is a hypothetical question and i do not fully understand it if i may say so <e> <s> at the moment prices are going up for reasons of the inflation we inherited and the once-only moves that we have made i repeat for reasons of the inflation that we have inherited and the once-only moves that we have made to lower tax <e> <s> so we have added to it but have added to it by a known amount <e> <s> in the last year of office of the government of noble lords opposite inflation was accelerating <e> <s> on a six-month basis it was over per cent <e> <s> we have added to it <e> <s> the fact is that profits are going down <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right in saying that they are going down because conditions are difficult but because when conditions are difficult competition exists as it does all the time very strongly it makes it quite impossible without a price commission for industry to profiteer <e>", "<cs> i am hoping that in a moment we can perhaps get on with the amendments <e> <s> i will try very hard not to respond in kind on this occasion but merely in detail <e> <s> the noble lord lord jacques said i was contradicting myself <e> <s> i do not believe i was <e> <s> i said that the effect on the rpi had been very small even at the height of the strongest price commission applications under per cent <e> <s> of the rpi <e> <s> i said it did a lot of harm of other kinds in breaking down competition and i would point out that <e>", "<cs> the minister appointed the working party and asked for it to report <e> <s> the civil service bless them are entirely loyal to each government in turn <e> <s> i think it would be quite wrong if in your lordships house we were to apportion blame or use as evidence reports requested by an administration <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may in general terms before the noble lord lord jacques decides whether or not to press the amendment again remind the committee that the purpose of what we are trying to do is to have a director general of fair trading with a relatively small staff who will be publishing reports in all sorts of different industries where different things are anti-competitive or unfair <e> <s> having rules right across the board is extremely difficult what is unfair and uncompetitive in one industry and one situation is not so in another <e> <s> what we are trying to do here is to have a body headed by a man of great ability and responsibility who will be picking up all the transient wisdom on questions of competition and there are many complicated and difficult arguments and different kinds of anti-competitive practice <e> <s> there is predatory competition and every sort and kind of effect of competition in different circumstances <e> <s> earlier in another amendment there was reference to the effect on overseas competition <e>", "<cs> i do not think that from these benches we can give any guarantee that the director general will issue guidance notes <e> <s> my noble friend has pointed out that his reports will in fact be published and that the cases on which he takes action will be published so the case law that already exists in this country will continue to build up but not with the full penalties of law <e> <s> this is one of the advantages of the quick investigation without reaching a stage where a company is considered to have broken the law <e> <s> this is the whole point of it that it will push the accumulated wisdom forward <e> <s> in addition to all that body of individual cases some withdrawn some practices with undertakings agreed the director general has the duty to publish the annual report that my noble friend mentioned <e> <s> i cannot and it would be quite wrong for any administration to do so tell the director general what to write in that report but it must be obvious that he is going to review the cases which have been through his hands in the year and i would think that he is going to make observations of the kind that the noble lord lord jacques has in mind <e> <s> i cannot from these benches give the noble lord a guarantee and it would be improper for me to do so <e>", "<cs> i do not feel able to do that <e> <s> these matters have been discussed and noble lords have no doubt read them fully in another place <e> <s> i do not believe that the halfway house suggestion which i think is the term my noble friend used is a starter <e> <s> i think that it would be inhibiting the director general if you started to declare what was fair or unfair unless you were to write literally volumes <e> <s> i do not believe that the proposition is a practical one and i am afraid therefore that i cannot give the undertaking for which the noble lord has asked <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord jacques answers that request for consideration i should love to appear a reasonable man as my noble friend has said always prepared to consult again <e> <s> but i am quite sure that we are on a wrong course here the committee is or noble lords opposite are <e> <s> what the noble lord lord jacques is asking for when he asks will the director general give guidance <e> <s> is in effect to ask me to tell the director general how to carry out this bill <e> <s> that we specifically do not want to do <e> <s> the director general must make very public all his actions <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord i think that my noble friend in the hope of getting through the less important questions fairly quickly has stated the governments position fairly brusquely <e> <s> but may i ask the noble lord who moved this amendment what it is that he thinks his amendment will achieve which is not in any event bound to happen <e> <s> the director general of fair trading is not in some ivory tower somewhere as i was saying to some of my noble friends on a previous amendment <e> <s> he has a statutory job to do <e> <s> he is bound to be accessible and fully accessible to all those with credentials to advise him on his task particularly those concerned with consumer protection which the noble baroness mentioned or with departments elected representatives local authorities national government and quangos who may be involved <e> <s> why is it necessary to state the obvious <e> <s> we are trying to keep bills fairly short <e> <s> why does the noble lord want to state what is bound to happen in any event <e> <s> we cannot give these bodies statutory powers <e>", "<cs> i am smiling about the skirts of the director general <e>", "<cs> i am glad the noble lord will not press it but we really are not being obstinate <e> <s> you either have to get the secretary of states agreement to every move of the director general of fair trading or if you do it the way this amendment suggests the director working on a wide-ranging brief looking for areas he wants to look at of his own initiative publishes that he is going to investigate <e> <s> if you have a delay before he starts a period for consultation you are bound to have every interested body in the country descending on the secretary of state and the director general to say do not start <e> <s> this would completely defeat the power of the director general to do these quick short sharp investigations in many areas and it would make life for the secretary of state absolutely impossible <e> <s> everybody would be on him if there was a need not to go ahead with the investigation until the secretary of state had decided whether to use the veto <e> <s> it really is not practical given the objectives of this body and this bill <e>", "<cs> if i have understood her correctly i think my noble friend is under a misunderstanding <e> <s> she is suggesting that under clause price control powers can be brought back <e> <s> but we are deliberately excluding the route via the fair trading act which is the subject of amendments to be moved by other people <e> <s> in clause the secretary of state can ask the director general to cause an investigation <e> <s> this would only be done in very rare cases <e> <s> clause deals with prohibiting the anti-competitive practices <e> <s> when it refers to the fair trading act it excludes the part of it which could refer to prices <e> <s> i may have got this wrong i asked my noble friend to check it but i think i have it right <e>", "<cs> i take it that we are also dealing with amendment <e>", "<cs> the objectives set for different public bodies by their sponsoring ministers vary to quite a high degree but as i have already stated it is not a disregard for prices which the government are suggesting <e> <s> it is that the prices will be at the most reasonable level possible if costs and efficiency are right and if financial objectives are secured <e> <s> there is also a danger if you do not leave it to the sponsoring minister with his objectives for the public body that if <e>", "<cs> together with the financial limits <e>", "<cs> i think that i have answered that point <e> <s> it is the financial limits and the objectives of the sponsoring minister and the noble lord mentioned the question of gas which will bear on prices <e> <s> the other factors which will bear on prices are the costs and efficiency of the organisation <e> <s> on prices as a whole there is really no room between those two forces of the general objectives and financial limits on the one hand and <e>", "<cs> i should love to agree with this amendment <e> <s> unfortunately i cannot be retroactive <e> <s> the reason why i use that term which is equally ghastly but in common use is that unfortunately the term monopoly situation is one that is used in the fair trading act and it cannot be avoided <e> <s> i sympathise with the noble lords desire to avoid what seems to be a very slipshod use of language <e> <s> in the present case however i have to point out that a monopoly situation has a precise meaning which is defined in the fair trading act and that to refer simply to a monopoly would not have the same effect <e> <s> i therefore hope that however reluctantly the noble lord will be able to withdraw his amendment rather than press me to act retroactively in relation to the act <e>", "<cs> i will undertake to look into this before the report stage but the point is that there is a definition in that act <e> <s> i am not familiar with all its details but the definition in the act says as i understand it that a monopoly situation means x y and z as a result i feel we shall find that it is impossible to change this <e> <s> perhaps however the noble lord will accept my undertaking that with a full wish to achieve his aim i shall look into it and come back at report stage to say whether we can get round this obstacle <e> <s> however i fear that i may have to confirm that we really cannot do so without quite a major amendment of the act <e>", "<cs> i should like to start where my noble friend lord teviot ended on the question of the words adequate control adequate control in terms of the purposes of this bill <e> <s> of course in almost every area of investigation under this bill account is bound to have to be taken of laws and of policies and of other acts and the act and the act have been mentioned specifically <e> <s> but in relation to the act it should also be mentioned that the providers of bus services generally are often effectively protected from competition by the licensing provisions of the road traffic act <e> <s> it is not the intention to cut across transport policies laid down or to question their detailed foundations but it is thought that independent scrutiny should <e>", "<cs> i think i may be able to help at least to a degree <e> <s> i do not want in any way to fail to support the views that my noble friends have expressed on the excellent job in many ways that the marketing boards have done and are doing and the extensive machinery under which they operate <e> <s> but there is extensive machinery in other areas too <e> <s> there are consumer councils and indeed the noble baroness lady seear will be speaking to an amendment in a moment in relation to consumer councils and consumer committees in nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the agricultural marketing acts which indeed set these boards up in many cases as monopolies although they contain many safeguards many checks and balances if that is the correct expression bear on all the purposes of the bill and on how these boards may act in relation to other traders <e> <s> therefore i hope very much that a form of words along the lines that i have described will satisfy my noble friends and allow the ligitimate purposes of the bill to apply to agricultural marketing boards with the minimum of duplication <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can give specific examples other than the type that i have already given <e> <s> this is the first time that we have had legislation on the statute book which bears on such matters as distortion of competition for instance i am thinking aloud to answer the question in relation to how particular customers might be treated <e> <s> again in each individual case people interested in particular bodies or particular types of companies are visualising that the director general of fair trading will be investigating them fully all the time and only them <e> <s> that gives me the opportunity of saying to my noble friend who quoted me my words in the second reading debate that this organisation is set up with a small staff much smaller than that of the price commission and it is set up with the object of making competition work <e> <s> my remarks on second reading were in relation to the price commission which in many respects did the opposite <e>", "<cs> that was a heart-moving appeal to accept an amendment how i wish i could respond to it and respond adequately <e> <s> however if i read the amendment correctly it would impose an obligation on the secretary of state to consider such representations specially <e> <s> the future of the nationalised industries consumer councils is under <e>", "<cs> i will try in my answer to emulate the brevity with which the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede moved the amendment <e> <s> my comments on this are in line with those i made earlier namely that for public body investigations or references we believe a combination of the financial limits and general objectives set by sponsoring ministers to nationalised industries and investigations into the efficiency of the organisation under clause are more than adequate to cope with any possible problems and that to bring back which i think is what the amendment seeks to do part of the price-regulating powers is the opposite of the governments objective <e>", "<cs> the governments view is that clause will be needed only in very exceptional cases <e> <s> if indeed we concentrate both on making competition work i have said this several times already today and on anti-competitive practices the market will take care of prices <e> <s> at the beginning of todays committee stage we had a long interchange which i do not propose to repeat on the question of the degree to which <e>", "<cs> on a point of detail first i think that the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has implied that the bill means that the secretary of state must be satisfied under clause <e>", "<cs> then i return the compliment <e> <s> the form of artful dodging that the noble lord indulges in is in paying not one bit of attention to the substantial evidence which we discussed earlier this afternoon that in fact the price commission had little almost negligible effect on prices and damaged business to a major degree <e> <s> i explained why that was not a contradiction <e> <s> i am afraid that noble lords opposite have never understood business and that is <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> steady <e> <s> i was resisting replying <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not agree with that <e> <s> we have had our full shares of the regional and social funds <e> <s> this charge has been levied against us in relation to the changes in the regional policy <e> <s> but the charge is not correct <e> <s> we shall be able to take our maximum share for certain and regional policy is my particular sphere up to and i am pretty sure beyond that but it rather depends on the alterations of the eec policy which like ours is tending to concentrate on narrow areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the cuts to which the noble lord referred were in regional policy <e> <s> if he refers to copies of hansard which i shall let the noble lord have he will see that we have discussed regional policy its cuts and its effectiveness on many occasions and i am quite satisfied that wales with a bigger share than any other of the main unemployment areas with less areas covered has a greater drawing power to the areas of greater need in regional policy now than it ever did have <e>", "<cs> we are not talking about cutting the same thing <e> <s> we have cut the cost of regional policy for what we believe is a more effective one by some million in great britain over a transition period of one year and three years <e> <s> as i understand it million is the welsh part of that cut <e> <s> i will not say that that has nothing to do with this but i would ask the noble lord to read the debates we have had on regional policy in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour with minutes on the clock which for me is worse than ever before and that is saying quite a lot i should like to say to the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts that i will write to him on the points that he has raised in relation to caernarvon and its current situation and the particular removal that he mentioned i am not briefed in detail on these matters <e> <s> i was surprised when he said that the unemployment figure was the highest in wales <e> <s> at the time that we did the regional regrading that was not so that i can remember <e> <s> but i have not looked at the figures very recently <e>", "<cs> my lords this anxiety which my right honourable friend fully understands stems from one of the many inquiries carried out by the government with the advice of sir derek rayner to look for economies in every area of government activity <e> <s> in the report which has not yet been published my right honourable friend made it clear that sir derek and the staff who examined this situation looked at the economies that might arise from payments fortnightly rather than weekly and also studied the effect of allowing those who wanted to use bank accounts and the number of the bank accounts as noble lords will know is rising to do so <e> <s> quite big savings are potentially possible <e> <s> the cost of the administration of social security as a whole is million per annum and of making the payments is million per annum <e> <s> but this in no way means that decisions have been taken and after publication my right honourable friend will consult with all interested parties including the sub-postmasters <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer my noble friend as regards the total number of payments made by different methods <e> <s> the total of payments is million in a year and that costs the million <e> <s> we are certainly looking at economies throughout the system in the crown offices as well as in sub-post offices <e> <s> also my right honourable friend made clear that one possible way of permitting a steady flow of business to go through the sub-post offices including those in rural areas would be the use of the giro system which could enable beneficiaries to draw what they wanted when they wanted it from the local post office even if necessary more than once a week <e> <s> this is one idea that is being studied <e>", "<cs> my right honourable friend is fully aware of the situation and the study has considered in great detail the reliance of different kinds of beneficiaries on the current system but in view of the size of the figures i have mentioned i think it would be quite wrong to suggest that no changes should be studied and no economies looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the government really do understand these things not only because many of their members are very conversant with the enormous social and practical importance of the local post office but because my right honourable friend the prime minister was actually the daughter of a sub-postmaster <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are fully aware of all those points but there is a need in the economic situation of this country at the moment to look at every area of expenditure because we have to economise <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this kind of problem with the existing network is being constantly examined by the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the main part of the noble lords supplementary is really a separate question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say to the noble lady that i have never known a village where the daily movements of every inhabitant are not known to every other inhabitant <e> <s> i think that the risk of old people living on their own and not being discovered is far greater in the towns <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give that assurance in those terms <e> <s> i have already drawn the attention of the house to the debate in the other place and my right honourable friend went over <e>", "<cs> my lords may i echo what all of your lordships have already said and thank the noble lord lord gregson in particular for introducing this motion at this time <e> <s> it fits exactly and neatly into the governments consultation period <e> <s> may i also thank the noble lord for the tone that he set in the debate which was totally non-political a tone which i think has been kept by every speaker since <e> <s> this has shown this house at its very best <e> <s> i shall even promise not to comment upon the remarks of the noble lord lord shackleton about intervention <e> <s> we also owe to the noble lord lord baker thanks for this motion in that i watched in the no day named section of the <e>", "<cs> my lords again i recall a remark of my old father when he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not want to give the impression that the oil companies and all the supporting expertise has not been a miracle of modern industry by both british and international companies nor that it is not of enormous importance but merely to point out that the rest of industry on which we will depend when oil and gas run out is in every bit as serious a situation as the finniston committee report implies <e> <s> we also accept the importance not the total importance but the very great importance of the manufacturing industry within industry as a whole <e> <s> of course all of us in this debate have accepted the vital importance of what the finniston committee have christened the engineering dimension <e> <s> while it is vital for all manufacturing businesses the number of <e>", "<cs> my lords i will come later if i may say so to the noble lord lord avebury to the question of those we are losing where engineers go and also what might be done in the shorter term <e> <s> but in general the governments position at the moment is the acceptance of the seriousness of the position <e> <s> at this stage we are open to consultation of which this debate is an important part on the methods of putting it right <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall read with interest the views of each individual institution <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon has raised a point which clearly is an important and broader one outside this particular area <e> <s> we shall certainly consider what he has said <e> <s> but let me just point out that as i read the finniston committee report they have started from the premise that all is far from well and against that have recommended if you like an intervention at this stage and in this current situation <e> <s> i have found myself making these notes with some interest in order to say them to a noble lord on the other side of the house nevertheless the committee has not recommended that this body should be left permanently at the dictate of appointments of government <e> <s> there could be an analogy in the hospital role of the neb that we have retained namely that one keeps the patient there until such time as he is fit to be returned to private enterprise <e> <s> nevertheless we will consider carefully the general point made but i want to stress that as i read the finniston report the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord lord airedale in which other act or acts he believes this phrase that an authority a director should receive representations is included <e> <s> i have just asked the gentlemen of great knowledge what the other acts are and they could not tell me of one <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord lord wallace of coslany what other acts he is referring to <e>", "<cs> i am sure it is not in any other acts my lords or at any rate my advisers cannot tell me of any and in view of that i would urge the noble lord not to divide the house on if i may say so a rather platitudinous statement that a director general should be open to representations when clearly he will be open to representations <e>", "<cs> my lords in deference to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos and to my noble friend lord godber of willington both of whom have been ministers of agriculture i want to say two things one that my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for agriculture and for trade have discussed this at great length and are happy with what we are putting before the house <e> <s> secondly we are not trying to undermine the act in any shape or form nor do i believe we will <e> <s> it is not a question of whether these boards are going to be referred it is a question of whether they could conceivably be in relation to an anticompetitive practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am informed not in relation to practices that the board might perform in relation to one customer or another and the effect that that might have between first point of sale first-hand trading wholesaler retailer beyond <e> <s> i am informed that the aspects which my noble friend covered very clearly the act does not fully cover <e> <s> we are talking about the very unlikely occurrence that there is a reference agreed by both secretaries of state in relation to aspects of this bill which are not covered in the act <e> <s> agriculture is being treated completely exceptionally in bringing in the need to consult in all the earlier clauses of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed very fully the question of price control both on second reading and in committee <e> <s> thus i shall be as brief as possible in reiterating only the main points that we made previously <e> <s> it is intended that investigations under clause should be purely fact-finding <e> <s> these amendments taken in conjunction with the proposed new clauses are totally <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord refers to quite another question the question of which minister in the other place would answer questions about price levels of particular commodities services or what-have-you where it has been decided that the minister whose department is responsible for that area should answer those questions <e>", "<cs> my lords again we have been over this ground before <e> <s> the power in this clause is not a replacement for the price control powers of the price commission legislation <e> <s> it is intended to be a fact-finding exercise to be used only in exceptional cases <e> <s> both these words major and significant would allow a myriad of small complaints to be made and they would not advance the situation of the level of prices <e> <s> we really have to divide the question of the level of prices and the events that are responsible for it and the effect of price control upon it <e> <s> we have been through that on many occasions <e> <s> i recognise that prices are an emotive subject and i realise that during the time which lasted for many long years when this government and the previous government appealed for adherence to an incomes policy as such it was argued that as a <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will only say that i believe that this clause can be used in a question of major public concern into prices of great significance and that is what it is intended for <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> nobody is going either to legislate or achieve a situation where the british public will not complain <e> <s> i am quite sure that they will complain <e> <s> what we are talking about is the secretary of states initiative to use the powers under clause and he does not envisage using those powers except in the circumstances prescribed in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take the noble lords statements as being supplementaries yes we do know that labour relations in the textile industry are on the whole very good indeed and that productivity is high <e> <s> the industry does however need and recognises this need to adjust to change all the time <e> <s> the mfa does afford a major measure of protection and the government are in no doubt that orderly marketing arrangements must continue after the end of the present mfa <e> <s> i do not think that the cost of energy is a major point in the companys decision <e>", "<cs> my lords one realises of course that there are fallout effects on dependent industries as the result of any loss of jobs <e> <s> the unemployment picture in bolton is at the moment almost exactly on the national average figures and in the areas concerned of all these four mills is unlikely to deviate far from the national average after these closures <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are determined to do everything within their power to provide a fair trading opportunity within our commitment to and interest in helping to maintain a relatively open world trading system <e> <s> that is essential for our export interests <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have been looking and will continue to look at the question of government purchasing in the context of giving british industry a fair trading opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the figure he quotes is approximately correct <e> <s> as high as has been mentioned as the cost to the average family over the period <e> <s> the productivity statistics which my noble friend quoted are perhaps those compared with the most efficient countries like japan and the usabut the productivity is nowhere near in line with major european countries either <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the question of the noble baroness lady gaitskell i think that my right honourable friend in the other place and i in this place have on many occasions since the unfortunate strike took place not only asked that the whole house should support the earliest possible end to the strike but have pointed out that if we had extra money which we could raise from the taxpayer for this purpose or if we felt it desirable to siphon it from other more desirable purposes it would not be a kindness to the average worker in the british steel corporation <e> <s> in view of the equipment which they now have it is an absolute necessity for the continued employment of those who remain in british steel that the industry becomes competitive without delay rather than avoiding the issue any longer <e>", "<cs> my lords i have up to date information on the subject <e> <s> i would remind the house that on th february i gave details of the very large amounts of money under all the european schemes which this country has obtained to help alleviate the problems of steel closures <e> <s> there is a proposed possible new scheme which would come under new social measures from the social fund which might provide in the first year of operation million <e> <s> my right honourable friend and co-minister was in brussels yesterday to explore the degree to which that extra money would be forthcoming and would be able to help in the re-adaptation and the measures necessary to try to soften the blow of the loss of steel jobs <e> <s> it is not money which can in any way help as regards the british steel corporations finances and what it can afford in its pay offer <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if we had moved more determinately sooner in accordance with the targets set by the secretary of state for industry in the previous administration it is indeed possible that our share of a depressed world market for steel products might be higher by now and more jobs might be able to be retained <e>", "<cs> my lords that is absolutely correct and i hope that both the size of the figures and the purpose of the fund which has been much reported in the media will make clear that the noble lord is completely correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the subsidies for coking coal in european countries has been well examined and i have explained it in this house on a previous occasion <e> <s> those subsidies do not in any way remove the overall truth that we are simply not competitive and that that is the major reason for the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the detailed figures for which my noble friend has asked but i shall let him have them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked precisely the same question on a previous occasion and i shall give him as far as i can remember it precisely the same answer <e> <s> there is no question but that an improvement in productivity one must say an overdue <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have been consistently firm about the figures concerned and for the cash limit of million which includes both capital and redundancy payments will be used for those purposes and for no others <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord assumes that the cost of the present strike which is undoubtedly bound to be very real at the moment to the british steel corporation will be borne by the taxpayers <e> <s> it is the governments view that the extra costs of the strike at the current time will merely result in a need for british steel to take the same actions as any other private corporation and to ensure that the extra costs are met by a reduction of stocks by if necessary disposal of assets and i hope not but if necessary by the loss of even more <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend is referring to the special ships for car transportation it was reported in the press that british shipbuilders had referred the order to the japanese <e> <s> that is not quite either the whole story or a fair story <e> <s> as i understand it from british shipbuilders this was one of approximately inquiries that they receive every year <e> <s> it was a rather tentative inquiry at that stage as are so many such inquiries <e> <s> british shipbuilders respond positively to about such inquiries <e> <s> i think that the answer to my noble friends original question is not to any major extent influenced by her supplementary question <e> <s> the original question relates to the stage in the restructuring programme which we announced on rd july and the progress made in that restructuring programme in order to reach a position where privatisation of the mainline activities becomes practical <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord any assurance about the idea of privatising as a whole rather than in parts <e> <s> indeed we have encouraged british shipbuilders to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that compensation is a separate question from the question on the order paper <e> <s> however the position on compensation is that since a declaration as long ago as was made on the principles of compensation that went into the act we have a situation where some cases for compensation have been settled in accordance with that act others have not and where share dealings have continued for some five years since the original declaration on a basis of the provisions of the act <e> <s> so there are very real complexities regarding going back in any way on the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the noble lord in full except to say that in the middle of the immense restructuring programme which we announced in july which has been agreed with both sides of the industry which involves a reduction from people to a little under people that is going to be a slightly higher reduction by agreement with the trade unions in relation to the latest wage settlement with order books in still running at only a little over half the target agreed between british shipbuilders and the last administration and endorsed by <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not necessarily or fully agree with the noble lord lord brooks of tremorfa <e> <s> it is more than possible when the restructuring programme is complete with a loss-making activity which nevertheless has the possibility of being turned by a private enterprise interest with knowledge of that particular activity that it might well make inquiries and take it over before profit is made <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has asked at least five supplementary questions <e> <s> we are aware of the sales position in the united states <e> <s> i think that everyone in the house and outside it is aware of the emotion not least engendered by the fact that many of us in the past have had one of those marvellous mgs <e> <s> the emotion is well understood <e> <s> i do not think that my noble friend is right to suggest that the bl plan represents a defeatist twist <e> <s> this must be a matter for bls commercial judgment and the government must be interested in ensuring that bl have a board which is going to take really sound commercial decisions including in the area of rationalisation substantially more than one interest in sports cars <e> <s> overall we must be concerned while we regret the loss of jobs in their producing a plan which will reduce the losses which i am informed include losses in the mg division and which will turn bl into a viable and profitable concern <e>", "<cs> my lords british leyland are well aware of the pressure in all areas in the other place in this house and among the public <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i can answer the noble lord lord shinwell clearly <e> <s> the government stand as shareholders to british leyland <e> <s> the normal interest of shareholders is to ensure that the company is well run and commercially run has an adequate board and particularly a first-class chairman <e> <s> the government believe that those conditions exist but they do not believe that a shareholders function includes going into detail of the rationalisation of different products in the same field <e> <s> we believe that to be the duty of managements and not of shareholders <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures have recently been announced by sir michael edwardes and i think that is a separate question <e> <s> yes it is indeed the duty of shareholders to nag the management of companies and we are nagging we are nagging that they should become commercially sound as soon as possible and get their reorganisation plans completed <e>", "<cs> my lords in the case of a nationalised industry the shareholders have plenty of opportunities for nagging and i assure you that they use them <e>", "<cs> my lords i expected that there could be the question of whether any egg might stick on my face in relation to this bill <e> <s> i accept the manifest goodwill in the noble and learned lords commiserations but i do not accept the commiserations <e> <s> i do not think that i need them <e> <s> we said clearly that the question of the duties of directors and the whole question of inside dealings were enormously important subjects <e> <s> we also said that we had a big legislative programme with some vitally important as we see it measures in other areas and also that at that stage we had a timescale to meet for the second directive <e> <s> we further said that it was important to get these major questions as right as we possibly could and to get the degree of balance into the duties of directors and into the control of inside dealings which would <e>", "<cs> my lords we aired very fully the subject of political contributions when the bill was with us before <e> <s> i do not think we should add in any way to what we said except that political contributions do have to be published <e> <s> that point needs to be made clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think we can take the house very much further <e> <s> we did consider other phrases <e> <s> the point is that the usual investment in this area is in securities <e> <s> however we did not want it to be exclusive to them <e> <s> therefore we used the term mainly which though short is fairly clear <e> <s> i believe that mainly means over per cent <e> <s> in securities for sure <e> <s> it is necessary to give to investment companies a good deal of flexibility <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon forces me to my feet <e> <s> i do not want to speak for long nor to make this a political matter <e> <s> i do not think it fair to describe these clauses and the bill as half-baked <e> <s> nor as i said earlier in reply to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones do i consider that it is entirely accurate to accuse us of a change of mind <e> <s> we have always felt these particular areas to be highly important and it has simply been a question of the order in which to bring them forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether in this case the noble lord in mentioning small businesses is referring to businesses which are private companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to say that many parts of the bill do not apply to private companies <e> <s> with regard to the smaller public company there obviously is a hardship in this very complicated area but i say again that i believe that we have managed to get it a little simpler in a number of areas and i hope that their trade associations and others will be able to help them with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the analogy was unfortunate in fact it forms no part of the governments answer <e> <s> the noble lord lord lyell is aware of a number of details going on in this kind of area <e> <s> what i want to say is that the policy lying behind the exemption in section is to prevent details not the kind of details that we may have put into your lordships minds from emerging that could be embarrassing to the director or the company in its dealings with customers or prospective customers abroad <e> <s> one can in that situation imagine circumstances in which details of contracts of service in various parts of the world like the middle east are best kept confidential <e> <s> i cannot give examples but i do need to withdraw the kind of example that we introduced into this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no amendments to these two commons amendments nos <e> <s> and and therefore i should like to move their adoption formally <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to describe amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord lyell mentioned it in his general introduction to this section <e> <s> it covers connected persons family and otherwise <e> <s> i am aware that there are amendments tabled to it and that will give me an opportunity to speak to those points which i know members of the house wish to press <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords the straight answer to the noble lord is that all the reasons given in the other place have a bearing but particularly that a child over certainly in the experience of members on this front bench is fully independent has no more dependency or connection or likely connection or likelihood to do wrong with his father than almost any other acquaintance <e> <s> as we know in the whole of this area of the bill we have a problem against the determined criminal acting in a collusive way <e> <s> but i believe it is quite unfair to single out an adult child who in many cases will have left his family home and i cannot see there is any more likelihood of problems from a grown-up child than from any other person <e>", "<cs> my lords i an not sure whether i can move those amendments <e>", "<cs> i stand corrected my lords <e> <s> i understood that the noble lord had an amendment down to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that must have been withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house doth agree with the commons in amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house doth agree with the commons amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i will with the permission of the house speak at the same time to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> these are the first two clauses perhaps the most important of the first of the clauses in the insider dealing section of the amendments which was clause in the other place and to amendment no <e> <s> a number of amendments have been tabled <e> <s> these two clauses are as i say concerned with insider dealing and there is wide agreement both in this house and outside that insider dealing should be made a criminal offence <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to deal first with the amendments nos <e> <s> a b and c and secondly to make a brief remark arising out of the remarks on the consolidated goldfields case which i do not believe bears on these amendments and i do not think that the noble lord thinks it does either <e> <s> he was kind enough to explain the purpose of it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord robertson of oak-ridge was kind enough to give us advance warning of these amendments and to explain the worries that he and his colleagues on the stock exchange have about the effect of this commons amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i may move these two amendments formally <e> <s> i have spoken very briefly to them <e> <s> if noble lords wish me to expand i will but otherwise i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon wishes to <e>", "<cs> my lords i have quite a lot of information on the degree to which the government believe that they have thought out pretty clearly admittedly in some hurry the necessary exemptions which are the subject of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> but i do not think that i shall weary the house in going through them in great detail <e> <s> if i may i shall commit myself to writing to the noble lord lord mishcon at some length as to how we see the difference in eurobonds and other similar dealers and the needs for this exemption in full <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the law society of england and wales pointed out to us that certain well-established practices in the eurobond market seemed to come within the off-market dealing provision and that the clause did not seem to be intended to affect that market <e> <s> this is where the information and suggestion came from originally <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> although there are amendments to this commons amendment i shall move it formally at this stage and try to deal with the main points on the next amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i formally move amendment no <e> <s> h which is strictly to define the off market dealer <e>", "<cs> my lords to take the noble lords last point first i do not think that the decision is a repudiation of helsinki <e> <s> indeed the community has tabled a new draft and is positive in its desire to help east european countries relations with the community in trade affairs <e> <s> to turn to the first point raised in the supplementary of the noble lord it is a problem of the competence and practice of the two bodies and of individual countries <e> <s> at the present time individual trade negotiations are carried out on some matters by individual countries particularly in relation to the east european states <e> <s> the competence of the community particularly to negotiate for all the eec countries is of a different order from that of the cmea <e> <s> these are detailed and complicated matters but it is felt that a further meeting is necessary at official level before the top-level meeting if the top-level meeting is to be successful <e>", "<cs> my lords contacts are continuing and we have offered a further meeting at official level <e> <s> certainly in this sense one should think in terms of a postponement not a cancellation <e> <s> in regard to the noble lords point about working towards a similarity in structure between the two organisations i do not think that is necessarily the aim of these talks or that it is necessarily desirable <e> <s> the two organisations are different <e> <s> they probably suit their own purposes very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a detailed matter that could come under this heading or under other headings <e> <s> i will let my noble friend know of the noble lords request that these matters should continue to be discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord added the words at the present time <e> <s> if the soviet union would do as the world requests it to do in relation to afghanistan we could be back to square one where encouraging trade between east and west generally is important <e>", "<cs> my lords there is certainly no chance of this agreement which is not an agreement at the present time being used in the manner suggested by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i still find myself a novice in winding up debates of this nature and i shall probably learn that one ought to stick to ones original brief <e> <s> but i am not going to do so <e> <s> i have listened to all the contributions to the debate with extreme interest <e> <s> various squiggles are written on a piece of paper <e> <s> therefore i may be a little less fluent but i hope that i shall be able to answer a few more of the points which have been made <e> <s> i am going to concentrate on the industrial aspects not only <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the government and the caa are aware of the export performance of this industry as a whole and of the ground radar section of it whose record is impressive <e> <s> an important consideration is the practice of other countries in relation to these high technology industries and both the caa and the government are aware of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not really want to add to what i have already said in view of the fact that the main orders have still to be placed <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly that consideration is in the minds of the government and once again of the caa <e> <s> this is a government so far as possible of non-interference and of allowing major purchasing authorities to exercise their own correct discretion in areas about which they know a great deal <e> <s> nevertheless it is in their interests to have strong home industries in any longterm sense <e> <s> it is certainly the view of her majestys government that public purchasing authorities will take that long-term interest into account <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a connection with the mod radars because the existing system uses part of the same defence radars but the future plan for these radar orders is based virtually exclusively on civil air traffic <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has me out of my depth but i am quite clear that the caa intends the radar system to be among the most advanced possible with modern technology <e>", "<cs> my lords it was clearly understood when my noble friend met the spanish foreign minister in lisbon that all such restrictions would be lifted <e>", "<cs> my lords i will convey to my noble friend those interesting comments which we i think entirely endorse <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble and learned lord is not in any way taking a share of the credit away from my noble friend who is at the moment in rhodesia <e>", "<cs> may i take a little time in my answer to the important statements that noble lords have made in relation to this clause amendment <e> <s> as various noble lords have said it is a fundamental one <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat more than i need to what has been said in the second reading debate but a degree of repetition has already taken place and i feel that i must answer some part of it <e> <s> perhaps if i take the time to do so on this fundamental clause we may not need to repeat ourselves i shall try to follow that lesson myself hereafter <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i did not catch the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> i think that the statement that public ownership should be expanded and that government agencies should investigate and reorganise large branches of successful private industry is much more dogmatic <e> <s> my statement at the beginning was that there was no <e>", "<cs> i think that as i continue the balance of what we believe will become clear <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord will be satisfied <e> <s> well i doubt whether the noble lord will be satisfied but certainly his question will be answered as time goes on <e>", "<cs> we believe that the health of the private sector of industry which has in the past created the wealth for this and other nations to a greater extent than the public sector has been debilitated over two decades in which controls lack of incentives taxation <e>", "<cs> because we are not dogmatic <e>", "<cs> it is because we are not dogmatic <e> <s> certain functions of the state have been agreed for many years and we go right back to defence and other things here <e> <s> nationalisation has taken place in many areas over a prolonged time <e> <s> the neb exists and my right honourable friend and i have paid tribute to the work they are currently doing in fact because we are not dogmatic <e>", "<cs> probably i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i said the market system would cause reorganisation and i further said that while the general reorganisation powers of the neb over an extraordinarily wide range are to be curtailed there is nothing to stop the neb within its terms of reference in the advanced technology industries in its existing holdings and in the assisted areas once more from prompting reorganisation <e>", "<cs> no but i shall write to the noble lord <e> <s> these matters are never entirely regular they will differ from country to country <e> <s> however as i understand it the majority of academic evidence is quite clearly that overseas investment is compatible with increasing exports <e>", "<cs> may i now turn to the major remaining function that the amendment seeks to change that is the question of the neb ceasing to have the function of promoting industrial democracy <e> <s> of course everyone in your lordships committee and every industrialist i know is trying in every way possible to arrive at a situation where all the people in a particular company will work with the same objective and much information is already being made available to all employees and trade unions within companies in order to do this <e> <s> i believe that every responsible company and certainly the neb will probably encourage its subsidiaries according to their various and particular needs to do everything they can to promote this situation because it is so important for productivity <e>", "<cs> i stand a degree of correction and accept it from the noble lord but the decline has been accelerating <e> <s> i do not think that in the s our record internationally was good and we lost a large share of world markets during that period but i accept that the situation has become very much worse in recent years <e>", "<cs> i must say that i said that the four roles of the neb that i outlined constituted a major task <e>", "<cs> i must tell the noble lord that one of my earliest commercial duties was to be in charge of the sale of ice cream on the free side of the race course that he mentioned and so i am well aware of the situation there <e>", "<cs> i covered parts of these points in resisting the previous amendment but this has been a most interesting discussion and i shall read it again with extreme care <e> <s> may i start by saying that i should like to associate myself and the government from these benches with the sentiments expressed by the noble lord lord rochester in relation to sir john methven <e> <s> we have lost a man of exceptional ability with a record of service to the private sector then to the public sector at the office of fair trading and then again to the private sector <e> <s> he was a man of great qualities and i know a personal friend of many of us here <e> <s> we shall miss him very badly <e>", "<cs> let me very briefly reply to the noble lord <e> <s> indeed i thought that i had taken too long in my original reply and if i did not specifically answer his question let me now try and remedy the situation <e> <s> i think that i answered it indirectly because i spoke of the continued involvement of the government in their own schemes and through the wide range of powers of the neb which we are keeping <e> <s> really my answer to him is that we have by no means pulled out of intervention or help in investments <e> <s> i mentioned a good number of the schemes that we still operate <e> <s> so i think that his assertion in the question is not a valid one <e> <s> but we believe that the scope of the government of this country in its present economic position to think they can as the noble lord has just said out of taxpayers money put everything or a great deal right is something that we regard as unrealistic and back to the thought of the neb as a panacea <e>", "<cs> i have some points to make of a general nature later and i shall hold them but may i just deal with the technical points in relation to these amendments before the noble lord lord rochester speaks because that might be helpful <e> <s> the words or to a nominee of his which these amendments seek to remove are necessary to avoid a difficulty which could arise under section of the companies act <e> <s> this is because some of the provisions of a limited liability company would not apply if there is only one member of a company <e> <s> for these provisions to apply there have to be two or more shareholders <e> <s> that is the whole purpose of the words which the amendments seek to remove <e>", "<cs> the amendments as drafted are technical and are designed to delete the words or to a nominee of his <e> <s> they do not stop businesses being transferred to the secretary of state so the amendments as drafted are technical and the reason why we require the words or to a nominee of his are those i have described <e>", "<cs> at this stage of a new government policy relating to the direction in which the neb should move it is not surprising that we have not yet had more than one case where it has been decided that the shares of an neb company should be transferred to the secretary of state <e> <s> there may well be more such instances for the reason that my right honourable friend mentioned to which the noble lord lord lee of newton has referred as well as for the reasons that i have spelt out <e> <s> his answer was typically short and to the point but i agree with him entirely i certainly will not speculate on the many possible problems that can arise within this policy of gradual disposal of major assets <e>", "<cs> i do not accept that the noble lord has a point of substance in relation to the second of these amendments <e> <s> as i have tried to point out in my previous answers i do not consider that it is a question of whether the secretary of state is better qualified than are other people to do a commercial <e>", "<cs> the fact that the noble lord has not moved the amendments which were standing in his name disappoints me no end because i wanted possibly at the expense of my noble friend lord cockfield to make the point that in the past many ministers have sought to leave out the powers of the treasury in giving permission for money affairs ministers of more than one government <e>", "<cs> but really that was not practical and the other amendment was a technical one <e> <s> i do not think that clause has any of the sinister concepts that the noble lord lord lee suggests if i followed him correctly <e> <s> this is a clause which follows the power to transfer assets to the secretary of state which we have discussed at considerable length and provides the necessary finance in i think unobjectionable sensible and technically correct ways in order for him to be able to discharge his duties if those companies are transferred to him <e> <s> i think i would really ask the noble lord to be a little more specific as to what is wrong with that <e> <s> i see it as inevitably following clause upon which the committee has just voted <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could interrupt <e> <s> i wonder how the noble lord would suggest that the secretary of state should carry out his responsibilities in relation to rolls-royce for instance in the continued probably quite long interval before that company can be returned to private ownership without the kind of powers spelled out in clause <e>", "<cs> i shall explain in a moment the technical purpose of this clause but in relation to who could have power over public dividend capital it clearly must be the government and the secretary of state working in conjuction with his colleagues <e> <s> to decide how much public dividend capital is necessary cannot he a question for the neb <e>", "<cs> there could have been different clause numbers <e> <s> it is clause which deals with the financial limits <e> <s> clause deals with the reduction of public dividend capital in the bill before the committee <e> <s> that is for the technical reasons that i have described <e> <s> otherwise if the board no longer has a company it would still have the dividend capital and we should not be able to do anything about it <e>", "<cs> i repeat that there is no existing statutory power to write down public dividend capital <e> <s> i also ask the noble lord to consider once again who can make decisions about public dividend capital <e> <s> it cannot be the neb it must be the government <e>", "<cs> following what the noble lord lord rochester has just said i shall not deal with questions of regional policy to which we have made ample reference at second reading and again shortly at the start of todays committee stage and which as the noble lord lord rochester rightly points out will come up no doubt under the clause amendment <e> <s> i say will come up if they must because in fact the policy within statutory powers has been decided debated at length in this chamber and clause as i shall describe tomorrow does not in fact alter the regional policy <e> <s> it is quite clear to me that noble lords opposite are taking any opportunity of restating the arguments on regional policy as such that have been stated before <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e> <s> i think we have gone far enough tonight at this stage on this subject <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can confirm to the noble lord that i am correct in saying that this is the act about which we are speaking it is this bill <e> <s> i see nodding from the box so i have hit it <e>", "<cs> may i confirm to the noble lord for sure what the answer to his question is <e>", "<cs> it might be for the convenience of the noble lord lord bruce of donington and his colleagues if rather than write to him i now clear up the reason why the industry no <e> <s> act is mentioned in clause a point which he raised a short while ago <e> <s> the reason is not a particularly good one and we think that we will get the matter right in the end <e> <s> the reference in clause is in fact to the bill currently under discussion which was my guess at the time the matter was mentioned <e> <s> as originally printed the bill referred in this clause to the industry no <e> <s> act in order to distinguish it from the act passed earlier in the year by the previous government <e> <s> with the turn of the year it was changed to but the printers omitted to drop no <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt <e> <s> the vast majority of the regional programme as the noble lord knows is the regional development grant <e> <s> the noble lord knows also that this is an automatic expenditure on virtually all capital investment of all the firms that are in the area already and that that is where the bulk of it goes <e>", "<cs> i did not say in scotland <e> <s> it is in the north of england in the main where there were major conservative gains <e>", "<cs> i must not detain the committee on this matter for long <e> <s> we resist the amendment <e> <s> i feel that in the words of lord rutherford <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord renton for not expecting me to take in all the possible consequences of writing three clauses and the schedules that support them in a different way <e> <s> may i say to my noble friend that at the report stage i shall give a statement as to why parliamentary counsel have advised this as the most appropriate form for the amendment <e> <s> all of these amendments will be consolidated into the act and that should alleviate the problem of understanding which is a very important point raised by <e>", "<cs> i accept the latter point and may i return to the former together with the other points <e>", "<cs> i welcome the lighter note that has now come into the proceedings <e> <s> let me say to my noble friend who moved this amendment that there is nothing that we want to do more than to encourage chambers of commerce to perform the very important functions which they do perform up and down the country <e> <s> but i have to say and i do not think that chambers of commerce themselves would resist this statement that they are stronger in some areas than in others and that they have more members in some areas than in others <e> <s> but our purpose will be to make our efforts complementary with theirs and not competitive wherever we can possibly do that <e> <s> i hope that that assurance will go a long way towards convincing my noble friend that it is unnecessary to press his amendment <e>", "<cs> as i have said these counsellors are retired businessmen introduced for the purpose of giving advice <e> <s> the arrangements for their employment are local regional and we are feeling our way <e> <s> this has been described to the house on a previous occasion in the small business debate introduced by my noble friend lady sharples and also in announcements which we have made <e> <s> if the noble lord would like me to do so i will give him more details of this but one cannot compare these counsellors with the number of civil servants as such <e> <s> we have stated that we shall report as we get more evidence of their effect or <e>", "<cs> i undertake to ensure that a copy will be laid before your lordships and i shall cover this technical point along with my noble friends other technical points at the report stage as recently promised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for making his views clear as to the reason for sir williams resignation which we regret <e> <s> for the sake of clarity of the government position i can confirm that while all nationalised industries would perhaps like it if there were more capital available for them to do everything they want to do we had a very happy co-operation between sir william and his board and this administration and we regret that it is coming to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the post office and it is more a matter for them than the government will take note of any advice on any better systems of this kind that might be possible <e> <s> in this context let me say that i am advised that the suggestion of my noble friend lord fortescue that a meter should be installed in the house is rather difficult when the charge depends upon distance as well as time and also when there are different rates for different times of the day or week <e> <s> this really does require a slightly complicated meter <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend <e> <s> we have an amendment later to leave out clause which may be moved and which centres on planning agreements as a whole <e> <s> i suspect that this subject will come up again then <e> <s> by then i shall certainly be able to answer the question of whether the machinery that my noble friend lord campbell mentioned was activated <e> <s> what i know now is that only two planning <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i said that they all do it all the time which was a point we discussed on a similar amendment at committee stage <e> <s> what i said was that businessmen would all say that it is a vitally important aspect of business <e> <s> in this sense it is a platitudinous remark <e> <s> some however do essential things which are known to everybody as desirable to do better than others <e> <s> what i did say is that it must be up to the neb to decide in relation to each of its subsidiaries in so far as you can interfere with the management of those subsidiaries which prod in which direction should be given is that subsidiary spending too much time with industrial relations and not enough trying to get its design its quality its commercial aspects right <e> <s> there will be different <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i would merely say to the noble lord lord leatherland that i too with him am against sin and to the noble baroness lady seear i would say that i really do not believe that the cause which we all support will be furthered by including in a statute for a body like the neb one aspect of good management which because the cbi is chanting it all the time the neb knows all about as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i am out of order in answering the factual question of my noble friend lord campbell of croy <e> <s> it is only two lines <e> <s> the machinery of the information powers in the industry act about which he asked have never been used and i understand that there has never been any formal requests that they should be employed <e>", "<cs> my lords we debated at second reading clause and its purpose as the key to this industry bill and at length on more than one occasion at committee stage <e> <s> much as i should like to accept the challenge to do it again in the interests of time i am not going to answer in almost precisely similar terms noble lords who have raised points which have been raised and answered many times before here and in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords in the main the purpose of this will be to relieve the effects of the steel closures <e> <s> the regional policy changes have been discussed previously and i am more than prepared to debate them at any time in the future because as i mentioned last time i was happy to discover a fairly large amount of waste in the previous regional policy <e> <s> i believe we have an overall effective regional policy in which to say that wales gets the

of which is the size of the payment to be made <e> <s> the second is the question whether the payments to lazards might be a device to make large payments to mr macgregor indirectly <e> <s> i stated that and in a moment i shall deal with that second question <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has heard the noble lords reiteration of the phrase and the context in which it was used <e> <s> i want to make it clear that the government have been looking at many possibilities to replace sir charles villiers whose contract does not run out until later this year <e> <s> naturally we have looked at the possibilities well in advance of that date <e> <s> i should like publicly to thank sir charles villiers and mr scholey for their co-operation while we have been searching for a successor to sir charles <e> <s> we have now completed the review of possibilities and have made an arrangement which allows the new chairman to familiarise himself and take up his appointment on st july a date agreed with sir charles villiers which is in fact before the date by which we needed to find a new chairman <e> <s> the whole implication that we were if i may use the expression flogging the hedgerows and in desperation coming at the end of the day to mr macgregor is not only a travesty of the truth and an insult to mr mcgregor but simply does not accord with the facts and the natural and correct procedure of my right honourable friend the secretary of state in looking at all possibilities very early <e>", "<cs> my lords i have acquired very great respect for the noble lord lord mishcon since i came somewhat new to this house but i regret that intervention <e> <s> i do not believe i have to say this that the stirring up of jealousy does any good whatever <e> <s> i also have to say that in my industrial experience i have not found the average british employee to be jealous <e> <s> indeed he thinks something is wrong with the concern if the governor is reduced from his jaguar to a mini

evidence of that i would point out that one could not help but be impressed by the fact that only employees of british leyland led so ably by sir michael edwardes voted against a plan which involved the redundancy of <e> <s> no good will be done by stirring up envy and i do not think the average man feels it to anything like the degree some noble lords have suggested today <e>", "<cs> my lords i

the government still believe what members of the government said in opposition that the compensation terms based on the six-month period and on market values of that six-month period have proved very harsh on a number of companies <e> <s> there is no doubt about that <e> <s> but we are dealing with a date which was a long time ago and since then many share transactions have taken place on the basis of the law as it was then enacted and as per the announcement and the six-month period which ended on th february <e> <s> one really would create enormous numbers of unfairnesses if after more than five years of share transactions on the basis of the law as established at the time one then changed it <e> <s> one also has problems in regard to the fact that out of the companies have already settled under the terms of the act <e> <s> so the problems of such a degree of retrospection are really extreme <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i am correct in stating that more than one basis has been used for compensation of assets on nationalisation <e> <s> i believe that in some cases in the past vesting date has been used and in this case vesting date was not until <e> <s> i believe that there has been more than one basis but this basis was used in this case <e> <s> with regard to comparison with the burmah oil case i leave it to members of the house to make their own comparisons on moments which are of good value or bad value in terms of assets <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is aware from my earlier answers that members of this administration are quite clear that they believe now as they believed then that there have been some unfairnesses <e> <s> i was not aware that only per cent <e> <s> of the companies had a market quotation at that time i am educated by my noble friend although i have no reason to doubt that the market valuation in relation to those companies which was probably related to the companies that did have a market quotation was arrived at according to the act and probably fairly accurately <e> <s> i think that the question of sale back in relation to these companies does not yet arise <e> <s> i have no doubt that as and when it does arise we shall study my noble friends remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords the position on that separate question has been stated in this house previously <e> <s> the aerospace bill has passed through your lordships house and i will not explain the provisions of it and in relation to shipbuilding we have made a statement that the time is not yet right although we intend as soon as it is to maximise private ownership in that area too <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord can explain because he has much more experience of the customs of this house than i the relevance of mr youngs appointment about which he could very easily ask a question to the third reading of this industry bill or to the industry bill all <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord bruce of donington for his personal comments and turn to the various points he has raised first and then to those that the noble lord lord hatch of lusby has raised <e> <s> i must say to him that i believe he has a theory about my right honourable friend the secretary of state which i can only tell him out of the last years contact with him is a false theory <e> <s> we on this side all share the view that private enterprise should be maximised and that it is the most effective way of creating new wealth which this country so badly needs <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade is in correspondence with the commissioners concerned on whether a better degree of priorities and order and method can be drawn up in relation to dealing with harmonisation of company law questions <e> <s> at this stage since those discussions are continuing i prefer not to elaborate further <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that in spite of having been in industry for a long time i had no idea either <e> <s> in fact a scission is the ceasing to exist of a limited liability company instead of the original company which ceases to exist one two or more

<s> i have tried to get my staff to trace an instance of this process having occurred in the united kingdom and i have been unable to unearth a scission <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the government have been in support of important measures on company law and on company law harmonisation where these affect the objects of the eec <e> <s> but as i have already indicated we are critical as indeed the european communities <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend spends a lot of his time ensuring that such channels are kept perpetually open <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i must quickly explain that both these bodies the european parliament and the economic and social committee were consulted when a proposal on scissions was included in the third directive <e> <s> there is an argument thus to <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall write to the noble and learned lord on the specific question of the channels of communication <e> <s> however i am sure that they are well and truly open and that we do consult the legal profession in all periods leading up to consultation with the eec on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already covered the question of whether the procedure has been correctly followed and i think that it is a mute point under the instruments of the eec <e> <s> we are pressing the point that as it is a mute point renewed consultations should take place <e> <s> i shall be delighted to answer the noble lords detailed questions by letter or in another way <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to ask him how many of those british companies are multinationals and can he say whether or not he is speaking of their worldwide profits <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my thanks and the thanks of the government to the noble lord lord schon for introducing this the latest in a long series of debates both on productivity and on economic affairs of which a major content has usually been discussions on productivity <e> <s> in my opinion it has certainly lived up to its predecessors in the quality of the contributions that it has drawn and i am quite sure that it will repay reading by all concerned who have listened to it and by many others who have not <e> <s> that is up to this point when as usual i try to sum up from notes made rather than from a brief and from hereon it may not be worth reading to the same extent <e>", "<cs> my lords

right honourable friend the minister of transport <e> <s> fair trading provisions exist in law and in codes of practice <e> <s> the institute of purchasing and supplies has i believe recently also issued one <e> <s> the cbi as i have mentioned is working on it <e> <s> as to whether this practice is as widespread as noble lords believe i find this a little perplexing from my industrial background <e> <s> it is well known in business circles that long credit is not the biggest advantage of small firms and therefore it is in the interests of all larger buyers to pay as promptly as possible and certainly within the terms laid down <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it must depend on the circumstances <e> <s> if noble lords will provide those circumstances certainly sponsoring departments will be ready to discuss the matter with the parties concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords again if my noble friend would like to give me details it will certainly help us when we come to consider the recommendation of the law commission on the possibility of automatic interest after a certain date <e> <s> if she will give me the <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is not in relation to high interest rates and if there is evidence of the wilful delaying of payments then i should very much like to hear it <e> <s> like many other large organisations today i am aware that some government departments because of difficulties concerning either computers or staff have got behind on payments at certain times but there is no policy of wilful delay on the official terms <e> <s> we did actually defer the payment of regional grants which went through parliament by four months <e>", "<cs> my lords not other than in the context i have mentioned when we come to consider the law commissions report <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that when the noble lord comes to read the report in <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord rochester for saving me the trouble of reintroducing reality into the discussion on the statement <e> <s> indeed i echo his comment that if the previous administration had shown more willpower in achieving the targets they themselves set for british steel in the years in which they set them we should perhaps have ceased at an earlier date to lose the share of market in british steel <e> <s> the further reality is of course that no serious commentator on the present situation is suggesting that currently the british steel programme which is no secret to the noble lord lord lee of newton based on a demand of million tonnes a year is an under-estimate in the short term at least <e> <s> furthermore the capacity and the noble lord lord lee cannot have it both ways that is being retained within the plan of the british steel corporation which produces the redundancies that i am speaking about keeps plant capable of a very considerable expansion above <e>", "<cs> i thought i had made clear and the statement makes clear that the resources will be found from the general departmental allocations which i mentioned <e> <s> so far as the manpower services commission is concerned i made the statement very deliberately very clearly that it is going to be enabled to carry out augmented or additional services more than it would otherwise be able to do <e> <s> to go into the detail on all government departments budgets over a prolonged period is not to answer the noble lords question but to mislead him <e> <s> there is no question but that the headings of the items mentioned cover additional or augmented services of the manpower services commission <e>", "<cs> my lords the funding of the derelict land clearance is even more complicated than that of the schemes of the department of employment and the manpower services commission and i suspect that my noble friend in fact knows rather more about the proposed plans for the allocating of capital expenditure to local authorities <e> <s> but perhaps i can help him by saying first that the local authorities concerned should be able to make use of the million grant that is to be made available <e> <s> it comes under block expenditure <e> <s> these expenditure plans are i know still under consultation with local authority associations but the governments objective is quite clear as regards this measure that is that they wish and believe they will be able to make possible land clearance schemes to that value which otherwise would not be made possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lord is article iii of the treaty of rome which has bound him and his colleagues in previous administrations as it now binds me <e> <s> the house may remember that when we put our new alterations of the regional policy to the house there was under this article the necessity to clear these measures with the eec and to give them adequate notice <e> <s> there is nothing new here he and his predecessors did it i have to do it and i anticipate no problems <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> one of the measures that i announced is indeed giving them extra training in conducting their own businesses if they have a skill of any kind <e> <s> factory space of every size is being considered and planned and of course bsc industry limited which is that part of british steel which deals with attracting new and often smaller enterprises into converted or new facilities is also spending money in this direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend has the <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody in the government wishes in any way to belittle the extreme seriousness of the situation in steel and so i find that i can echo the opening words of the noble lord lord lee <e> <s> it is indeed a very serious situation and it arises to a high degree out of the failure of previous governments to ensure that the british steel corporation management faced up to the realities of the market and the realities of the competitive situation between british steel and the steel industries of other countries so we have a really major problem to sort out <e>", "<cs> my lords it will not of course affect the cash limit because a write-off in the books does not do so <e> <s> so it is a book transaction to bring the assets into line with the realistic value as they now stand <e> <s> the main part of the statement relates to the cash limit for <e>", "<cs> my lords the plain answer is that the whole of our policies are directed to improve the competitiveness and ultimately the profitability of british industry so that we get industrial recovery <e> <s> we have unfortunately taken on on a road which was leading straight downhill to the industrial desert that the noble baroness mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i like my noble friends medical analogy <e> <s> the new doctors first task has to be to stem the haemorrhage <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that we are taking all available help from the ecsc and will continue to make sure that we do <e> <s> i believe that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment has said that we are increasing our efforts in training now <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said that this is a very serious announcement about a very serious situation <e> <s> the reason that i find myself answering this question is because i want to do what little i can to reverse the decline of british industry and avoid it all going abroad which it has been doing for a long while <e> <s> it has been doing that because of the apparent inability of the party opposite to see that the way they and i have to say previous governments of my own party have treated industry over the last decade has produced a situation in which our industry is very weak indeed a situation in which reality has not been faced <e> <s> it is therefore particularly difficult for my right honourable friend and the government to bring in reality at this stage and inevitably it causes very serious and distressing situations <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord does not for one moment doubt the sincerity of the government and of all my colleagues in trying to ensure that british industry recovers and becomes really competitive <e>", "<cs> my lords once again may i say that the government do not believe that they hold a magic wand <e> <s> it is perfectly correct that we are not yet satisfied that in this very serious situation all steps possible have been taken <e> <s> in particular bscs own targets for the improvement of their efficiency and competitiveness have just not been met <e> <s> we certainly wish to hear from the new chairman in whom we have great faith as to the practicality of meeting those targets and how soon <e>", "<cs> question <e>", "<cs> my lords my reason for rudely interrupting the noble lord lord wynne-jones was that only a few days ago i repeated a full statement made in the other place on the future of consett scunthorpe and the individual areas <e> <s> i have nothing further to add to that statement and to the remedial measures statement that i made at that time in relation to consett <e> <s> i could repeat it all but i do not think that it would be in the interests of the house if were to repeat statements and the answers that i made to questions on those statements over and over again <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept the noble lords premise that if the planned closure at consett goes ahead as proposed it will produce intolerable social strains <e> <s> that it will produce a very severe problem and that we need to mobilise a great many remedial measures most of which have been announced and about which i shall remind the house if requested is undoubted <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that the results at consett have improved and through the efforts of the people working at consett is accepted and has happened <e> <s> to say from that that consett is a highly successful steelworks is not correct on any long-term basis <e> <s> there is a substantial improvement but no more <e> <s> so far as the governments responsibility for the situation leading to the closures which british steel judge must include consett noble lords opposite must look to themselves and to their failure to face realistically the situation of the uncompetitiveness of british steel as a whole at an earlier time <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have repeated before in this house we have taken all available offers from the ecsc and from the commission <e> <s> i think my noble friend may be referring to certain proposals which go beyond that for which there is not an eec budget nor is there an agreed scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept that the closure of the consett steel mill will turn consett into a deserted town <e> <s> the employee numbers in and they have worsened only a very little bit since in the travel-to-work area of consett were <e> <s> the present unemployed position which is serious and that is why the area is a special development area shows that the figures are of the order of <e> <s> the number of redundancies declared by the british steel corporation is <e> <s> those are the proportions and i think the noble lords statement is an over-statement <e> <s> against those numbers the government have announced factories at a cost of to million which could provide jobs on the average jobs to the square footage of factories of over jobs square feet of the factories are under construction at the present time and square metres have been agreed <e>", "<cs> at consett <e>", "<cs> my lords the youth opportunities programme will be expanded in all steel remedial areas and there will be enhanced measures under the four headings which i gave in the recent steel remedial statement for all steel areas <e> <s> in addition my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment as you may have seen reported in the press yesterday spoke at nedc on the problem of extreme unemployment in these particular kinds of areas and he is to table a further paper with further ideas for discussion with all parties at the nedc in i think a months time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made no major distinction between them <e> <s> what i said was that i did not accept intolerable social strains <e> <s> i believe that with the measures that we take the social strains which are very real will not become intolerable <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the manpower services commission are closing and opening skill centres in various parts of the country <e> <s> i happen to know the detail of that at corby where a similar criticism has been made but i am afraid i do not know the details of the particular situation which the noble lord lord wynne-jones raises in relation to consett <e> <s> however i <e>", "<cs> my lords this government are well seized with the need to have a really competitive and efficient steel industry <e> <s> i say once more that if their policies and if the policies of the british steel corporation had been applied and supported some years ago we would have now a much stronger base for the purposes the noble lord has described <e>", "<cs> my lords some of those factories are already booked i have forgotten what the official term is for booked but far too few of them <e> <s> certainly i do not wish in any way to mislead the house on this but the problem of consett is indeed to attract other employment to that area <e> <s> all i can <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first tell the noble lord that while there has been much press comment on the accuracy of which i cannot remark the decision in relation to jetstream or its rival has not yet been taken <e> <s> however the new policy will be fully taken into consideration in arriving at that decision <e> <s> in relation to british airways i know that the noble lord with his great experience of trying to supply them and other airlines has from time to time suggested that their policy has not always been most helpful to british industry <e> <s> i also think he would agree with me that he has never asked that they should be ordered to buy british at all costs and that value for money early contact and working together on development is the <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the new policy will cover all products where british industry can offer the right product as good value for money <e>", "<cs> well my lords i am not able to give an informed judgment on the degree of constructive purchasing policy of british airways in previous years <e> <s> however i can assure the noble lord that the new policy is designed to ensure that all purchasing authorities do their very best to drag forward new british technology and to look at the needs in order to produce not only what the purchasing authority itself may want but what may also sell on the world markets and in that way to be able to secure better value for money in the long term as well as the short term <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for industry in the other place on the postal monopoly <e> <s> the statement reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both the noble lords for their clear comments on the statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord ponsonby commented not so much in terms as he said himself of the statement but what if i may use the phrase he thought it implied <e> <s> i have known my right honourable friend the secretary of state for industry a long while <e> <s> he has a habit of meaning exactly what he says no more and no less <e>", "<cs> i understand that to be the constitutional position <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may deal only in the time available with the last part of my noble friends question the reason we have put in a minimum charge is to make sure that this is not a pirates charter <e> <s> in a service where some parts of the carriage of letters are inevitably more economic than others where a large traffic is involved over short distances on the one hand compared with smaller and dispered traffic in other areas on the other if there were no minimum charge the steps we shall be taking could be tantamount to a very far-reaching breach of the monopoly and <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is among many who have made recommendtions in relation to christmas cards and i shall draw her recommendations to the attention of the new chairman of the postal services <e> <s> some proposals in the past to ease the position on christmas cards have been opposed by the workers in the post office <e> <s> i very much hope that as cooperation in that respect improves it is improving and they have agreed to operate trial services which are leading to increased productivity at the moment schemes like this may be able to be discussed again <e> <s> i cannot commit the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord feels that the proposals are objectionable and will result in higher charges <e> <s> one of the main purposes of the proposals is to try to ensure that the charges do not continue to escalate and the service to deteriorate <e> <s> the noble lord said that our objective is to weaken nationalisation and to attack the nationalised industries and that we are doing this on a minority mandate <e> <s> i expect that his reading of the opinion polls is probably the same as mine that one does not read all for gospel <e> <s> nevetheless on the subject of nationalisation every opinion poll in recent years has shown quite clearly that the bulk of the public even if noble lords opposite have not realised it realise that nationalisation is inefficient and does not give them a good service <e> <s> our object therefore is not to weaken nationalisation or national services <e> <s> indeed we are supporting the armed services in every respect that we possibly can <e> <s> there are things which can best be done by the state <e> <s> however there is quite a lot of international evidence that the carrying out of some industries functions by nationalised means is not always the most efficient <e>", "<cs> my lords it is because of that situation that we are protecting the whole service and supporting the post office in all their efforts to improve the efficiency of the service again <e> <s> the efficiency of the service is improving and they are moving towards their internal charter <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take first the very helpful statement by the noble baroness lady seear she has done my job for me <e> <s> it is for the reason which she explained so clearly that we have introduced this policy and believe in it very strongly indeed <e> <s> i can confirm to her nevertheless that it is our intention to keep the integrity of the post office basic network intact as it is and that goes through to the first telephone and it goes through to the approval and in some cases the installation of complicated wiring with exchanges <e> <s> i think this once again shows that after taking evidence from all parties we have introduced a sensible practical and moderate approach to this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords it is between the two <e> <s> the legislation which this statement heralds will be introduced early in the next session and thus large parts of it including all the supplying of instruments and extensions will start to be able to be put into operation in about a year from now <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend wishes us to go further <e> <s> most countries retain a monopoly situation as regards their basic network <e> <s> the united states did go as far as liberalising the first instrument but it has run into a certain number of quite serious problems as a result <e> <s> for example it is difficult for a householder to know whether it is in fact the first instrument that has failed which has been put in by a private supplier and is due to be maintained by him or <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall bear the noble lords point in mind in the discussions which will be taking place with all parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that both points have been taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely clear about the answer to that point <e> <s> however i undertake to write to the noble lord on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to follow the noble lord into a debate on the eec its agricultural policy or even a broad-ranging debate on steel itself on which we have had a number of discussions in the past <e> <s> on the question of this order and to deal first with the point that the noble lord raised on the availability of documents the treaty of paris was signed in and i believe that copies would be obtainable from the library if they are still there <e> <s> but certainly this is not a secret document

have been the release of a statement today on the financial position of british shipbuilders but it has been delayed by the congestion of parliamentary business <e> <s> however a statement in some form will be released to parliament before the recess and as i said in my original answer we very much hope to be able to make a statement on privatisation and related matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept what the noble lord has said <e> <s> we do of course accept that in certain yards and in the warship area profits are being made <e> <s> should any move and that decision has not been taken be made towards privatisation of those profitable parts of british shipbuilding account will of course be taken of that in relation to the plans and the targets for the very important remainder of british shipbuilding and here we disagree with the noble lord we believe that a viable british shipbuilding industry is a possibility in those areas <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall as usual give the reasons for any decisions we make when we release them <e>", "<cs> my lords the importance of the public sector orders to british shipbuilders is well understood and is given every consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it well might reassure some <e> <s> it depends upon your view of the past history of british shipbuilders and your confidence in this administration to help british shipbuilders

already said we shall certainly press for reciprocity in the areas of m fa and others via the community through whom and by whom the negotiations must be conducted <e> <s> yes my noble friend is right

the imports are of course to clothe the population of hong kong and the exports tend to be the higher added-value garments going abroad and the <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of the difficulties of the wool textiles industry and indeed of many sections of the textile industry and clothing <e> <s> we are also very aware of its very fine record in exports right up to date <e> <s> so far as the eec is concerned i think i have first to say to my noble friend that as members of the eec there is of course not only nothing to object to but everything to be gained by free trade within that new market <e> <s> indeed the growth of imports into this country from eec sources is much greater than the growth of trade from the developing and cheap-cost countries <e> <s> i think that perhaps i would refer the house to the textile debate which took place on th july in the other place and to the statements of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and the minister of state which have covered all these questions in considerably more detail than it is probably possible to do by way of answer to a starred question and to supplementary questions arising from it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have told the noble lord before we are fully aware of the pressure and the criticism about the compensation terms and we share the view that they have been unfair to a number of companies <e> <s> i really cannot add to what my right honourable friend the secretary of state said on th august and i must draw the noble lords attention to another principle which is equally important <e> <s> it is that of retroaction a terrible word <e> <s> but if we are to start altering statutes passed in and based on values which is the problem in and based on an announcement in march after which there have been both many settlements under the act and many share dealings in company shares and in parent company shares if we are to go back on all that we are bound to create much more unfairness and to set a precedent that retroactive tampering with previous acts is also a permissible affair <e> <s> that is just as big a problem <e>", "<cs> everything good my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i have said it is right for any government to reverse or tamper with acts that have been passed <e> <s> to pass totally new acts for the future is another question <e> <s> but here we are talking about a nationalisation act that was passed through parliament with certain terms which the outside world reluctantly in many cases had to accept and act upon <e> <s> the noble lord is not pressing us to bring in new privatisation legislation which we are trying to do whenever we can but he is pressing us to go back and alter the terms of an act passed a long way back <e> <s> any government that does that will receive criticism from these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell my noble friend that interest has been payable since vesting day that is between vesting day and the date of settlement for the individual companys case <e> <s> for interest to go back before vesting day bearing in mind that the act became law only on vesting day would i think be a principle that has not previously been followed <e> <s> therefore interest has been payable between vesting day and the date of settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think this may be an unpopular remark to make that any government is capable of preventing unfairness as it turns out after the event <e> <s> although we criticised very heavily and would still do so the party opposite for nationalisation at all in this area and for the terms of that nationalisation they did not set a new precedent in naming a particular period for trying to assess the value of companies concerned <e> <s> the problem arose in the length of time between the announcements and the act finally becoming law <e> <s> during that period a number of companies did substantially worse and a smaller number of companies did substantially better than they had been doing in the reference period <e> <s> it is of course the latter which in retrospect one can see have been treated extremely unluckily to the point of unfairness <e>", "<cs> my lords it is entirely up to the noble baroness to decide when she puts down questions but i do not think i shall be able to add to the answer and answers i am giving today during this session <e> <s> yes it is a rather long time but these consumer committees have stood for some years within the nationalised industries <e> <s> there are in all including scotland and northern ireland some of them <e> <s> so it takes a little time to conduct a thorough review after so long into so much <e> <s> as to what my right honourable friend will do when she receives the report her options are open <e> <s> any major changes would require legislation and then the normal processes which would involve consultation at some stage would take place <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> although the airline users committee is not a statutory committee and this is a subject on which i know the noble baroness has views the scope of the review committee will cover airline travellers and what procedures are thought to be best for their interests <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure of which i quoted included wales as part of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that it would take months i said that my right honourable friend expected a report later in the year <e> <s> i cannot go beyond that <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question but perhaps it gives me the opportunity to point out that the consumer has not only the protection of the existing committees <e> <s> the fair trading act has been used by the present government and the competition bill has been enacted and a number of parts of the nationalised industries have already been referred to the monopolies commission and reports have been received <e> <s> all those facts are designed to increase efficiency which will benefit the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing in what i said would enable the noble lord to come to that conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall pass the noble lords remarks on to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i deliberately did not waste time by saying that i did not have any news and by telling your lordships what has already been made very clear through the chancellor of the exchequers statement on th august <e> <s> as i really cannot take the matter any further forward than that i did not waste your lordships time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very important from whatever quarter to continue the emphasis on the microelectronics industry because of its all-pervasive influence on the whole of british industry <e> <s> we therefore welcome the latest technology both developed at home and by companies who bring it from overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords the recent closure of the three consumer electronics factories in this country was caused by a whole set of factors including the world recession and the international competition in this area <e> <s> while we regret it very much fortunately we still have in this country a strong consumer electronics business which we believe will survive and grow <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a separate question that ought to receive attention to itself if it were to be tabled <e> <s> however such teaching is increasing in schools and universities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad my noble friend asked that supplementary <e> <s> first of all as long as the government are concerned we believe in an open climate for investment for our industries abroad and for other people here but we do not intend to give aid <e>", "<cs> my lords that is their choice and their commercial decision <e> <s> we have a regional policy and if indeed their needs can be met in the areas of greatest need we are of course happy <e>", "<cs> my lords that again i think is mainly a separate question <e> <s> but we continue major support of micro-electronics <e> <s> we have backed the second stage of inmos we have two major micro-electronic schemes which are still operating and we have companies specialising in the defence area which are in the forefront of this kind of development <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a breach of copyright if first the programme which is taped includes copyright material namely a literary dramatic or musical work a sound recording or a cinematographic film or if the broadcast is itself of a tape and secondly the private individual making the tape does so without the authority of the copyright owner <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the technical position is that the owner of one of these machines recording a programme which is the subject of copyright should in fact get the copyright owners permission and that is not necessarily either the bbc or the iba before he does it <e> <s> palpably as i think the whitford committee saw very clearly that is an impossibility and perhaps it does not matter very much so long as the tapes concerned are being used only for private purposes and for the convenience of the house-owner to look at a programme either again or at a time which is convenient to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that from this box i cannot ask a question back <e> <s> but the question in my mind is would my noble friend like to suggest to me how the copyright law which is a very important law and which works over the whole of the rest of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it depends whether you show it to a welsh audience or a new zealand audience <e>", "<cs> no my lords but i will let my noble friend know whether any have taken place in relation to use in a home <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble and learned lord is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be quite wrong to forbid if that is the noble lords suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i should answer any more questions <e>", "<cs> my lords following those supplementary questions may i have a moment before moving on to the next ones <e> <s> we really do understand the severity of the situation <e> <s> at the same time the textile and clothing industry as a whole is still some or a little under that strong and still represents per cent <e> <s> of the total of those employed in manufacturing industry <e> <s> thus it is a very important industry and the situation in it is well understood <e> <s> in stressing the problems which obviously he feels about very deeply the noble lord suggested i think or by his intonation he did that we were not doing anything <e> <s> of course that really is not true <e> <s> our international obligations which i mentioned in my first reply cover the mfa negotiated before our time and renegotiated in and the tokyo round <e> <s> in both cases we have used those obligations to the maximum possible extent <e> <s> we have some quotas in relation to cheap wage cost countries supplies <e> <s> thirty new quotas have been negotiated this year and i think that that is the greatest number that has been negotiated in a single year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord always has constructive things to say <e> <s> i assure him that if i am unable to be present when he is speaking i shall read <e>", "<cs> my lords the question refers to oldham which is still an intermediate area and thus eligible under section of the industry act until and section grants are still being made <e> <s> we are constantly looking at cases from all over the country in relation to gradings and where extreme changes have taken place since our review of regional policy as in the case of the massive steel closures we have acted <e> <s> but we have to take account of the long-term positions of these areas in terms of altering any other gradings <e>", "<cs> my lords in the time available to answer the question i would say only that there have been two successful anti-dumping applications in relation to the united states of america in this field and there are others being considered by the commission at present <e>", "<cs> my lords in terms of the noble lords original question i would say that in the cotton and textile fields the figure is which is still a very considerable part of the whole <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend has recently made clear that there is no change in the roles of the neb that the resignations of sir arthur knight and other directors are all for outside reasons and that he does not anticipate any difficulty in filling their positions <e>", "<cs> my lords the question bears on the number of holdings that have been sold which i have already revealed was in line with what i told the house a year ago the approximate level of sales would be <e> <s> so far as the wider question of the neb is concerned we shall shortly have the industry bill in this house when no doubt these matters will be discussed again but sir arthur knight has said publicly and my right honourable friend in the other place has drawn attention to it that his resignation is not only for personal reasons but that there is no difference of opinion on policy <e> <s> sir john king has agreed to take the chairmanship of british airways and sir robert claytons very important functions in one of our largest engineering companies do not leave him with adequate time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that those questions are at stake or have been at stake <e> <s> i think the board is performing according to the revised roles in an excellent way <e>", "<cs> my lords i think in my original answer i made clear that we are very satisfied with the degree of disposals at this stage <e> <s> of course the neb still has a portfolio of some companies in all conscience a very big task for any holding company <e>", "<cs> my lords i think her majestys government have acted with extreme prudence and in a very pragmatic way <e> <s> the number of disposals of shares is of eight companies <e> <s> we did not in fact press the neb to dispose of them at an inflexible rate <e> <s> in february of this year i made clear to your lordships that in fact we were not pressing a particular detailed plan and timing <e> <s> however the board has managed to achieve good sales of eight companies and i believe that it will continue in an orderly way as and when it is possible to dispose of more shares to enable those companies to prosper in the private market-place <e>", "<cs> my lords i think in this house we have been through the arguments as to whether the neb should have a broad-ranging positive role <e> <s> there will be another chance when the latest industry bill comes to this house after the christmas recess and i do not believe that i should be drawn into these wider questions today <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one reason why i said that perhaps more is going on than we are given credit for <e> <s> when we respond to acard i think we shall point out that in private industry and in government more is probably going on than is realised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot this evening <e> <s> clearly if we are to publish a white paper we must publish a white paper <e> <s> i have said that we are actively discussing the contents of it between all departments at present <e>", "<cs> my lords there has however been this criticism that except in some fields where a great deal of private research is done we do not use our fundamental research and do not apply it commercially <e> <s> in fact i tend to believe that the failure to apply is very often post-development <e> <s> in that context we must realise that the profit levels of our industry are only about one-quarter of those in the united states in real terms and that that has been so for a good many years past <e> <s> to get enough private effort on long-term risk projects when the general level of return is so low is a problem <e> <s> therefore this whole area is bound up with the eventual return which we must achieve to a highly efficient competitive and profitable industry <e> <s> meanwhile we have as usual if i may say so to the noble lord the leader of the opposition shown ourselves pragmatic by the encouragement of the formation of celltech <e> <s> i would end on the general theme with the remark which i believe is correctly attributed to lord rutherford which probably applies to this area that is we have not got much money so we must think <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords remarks will be drawn to the attention of those concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his supplementary and for giving me in advance some indication of what was in his mind which is helpful <e> <s> let me first say to him that we have met recently and shall again no doubt meet very soon with all and with individual sections of this industry and that applies both to my department and to the department of trade <e> <s> we have been in constant touch over their many difficulties <e> <s> i should like to nut the situation in perspective because while i think we are well aware the industry has made us well aware of the particular sections which have been most severely pressed nevertheless in september the industry still had people working in it that is textiles and clothing together and the loss of jobs january to september was <e> <s> therefore we must keep this in perspective <e> <s> i do not think that the government are in a position to fix a minimum level <e> <s> although we continue to discuss with industry all possible steps to help them particularly in the areas where they are hardest pressed <e>", "<cs> my lords the textile and clothing industries all over the world have special problems and are the subject of international agreements <e> <s> broadly we try to ensure that those international agreements give our industry a fair trading opportunity a competitive situation with developed countries and a limit anyway to the rate of increase of imports from the developing world <e> <s> everyone else does this under the mfa arrangements and indeed the united states of america probably enforced the arrangements under the mfa a bit more promptly and vigorously than has the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware of the successful negotiation which took place on tuesday of this week in brussels in which the council adopted a declaration which agreed that developments necessitated a new and stronger initiative and invited the commission urgently to pursue discussions with the united states administration over the whole range of problems and possible solutions and to report back to the council as early as possible with a first report in february <e> <s> the issue is large and complicated and a little different from the noble lords question and i prefer to leave it at that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have already said that we are aware and kept aware certainly week by week and even day by day of the situation in this industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no plans to introduce a temporary interest relief scheme for companies in the textile industry <e> <s> in the first place high interest rates are causing difficulties for many companies and it would be invidious to single out the textile sector for special treatment <e> <s> secondly even if this were feasible the selection of those companies which were thought to have a viable future could be done only on an arbitrary basis <e> <s> thirdly the extra cost involved in such a scheme would only make more difficult the task of bringing public expenditure under control <e> <s> we are determined to get interest rates down as soon as possible and the further cut in minimum lending rate announced on th november is a step in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords the schemes proposed in belgium and holland and that is their status are under scrutiny by the commission in brussels <e> <s> in the case of holland under section of the treaty that country have been informed that they should not introduce it pending further investigation <e> <s> as for interest rates pressing on this industry as i have already said they press on others <e> <s> we will not be diverted from the need first to get inflation under control by the root causes <e> <s> if we failed to do that by bringing down interest rates prematurely we should certainly do more harm to this hard-pressed industry as well as to many others <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that that scheme would not be practical nor would it be just <e> <s> although the pressures on this industry are severe it is by no means alone <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that bank lending has been at an absolutely record rate and the government are determined that the total money supply shall not expand more than approximately the target range of something like per cent <e> <s> extra in a year when the countrys industry has not produced any extra goods <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the noble lord lord rhodes the government cannot decide on a fixed size of any industry it is beyond the capacity of a government to do that <e> <s> what we can do is everything possible to strengthen our international arrangements which we inherited when we came to office and we have said we will negotiate or try to negotiate a thoroughly strong mfa <e> <s> we have also taken steps which i have already referred to to cause comprehensive discussions between the community and the united states from which import penetration is coming at the fastest possible level <e> <s> within the practical steps we can take in our international trading agreements the industry has to compete and decide its own size within those parameters <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole question of interest rates within the community is under continual discussion and particular discussion at the moment in relation to exports and i do not believe that our exporting industries compared with others are in fact handicapped <e> <s> as for the noble lords first assertion that has been well stated in various opinion-forming journals the general proposition however must remain that if money and credit expands to a great extent inflation will follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i have anything further to add except to draw the attention of noble lords to the fact that we have given this industry both through regional policy and through the special selective policy under section of the industry act very considerable assistance <e> <s> my department has been examining the help given in all competitive countries and is continuing to do so as a matter of urgency and overall i believe we shall be able to give our industry a fair trading opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords point must be a matter of opinion <e> <s> the industry itself recently held a conference in manchester and put its own design capability under the spotlight <e> <s> the conference was entitled product policy for the s <e> <s> the industry is very conscious of the need to improve wherever improvement can be made but it is the view of my department and i share it that while standards of efficiency will always vary within each industry this industry has been efficient overall <e> <s> its productivity and its co-operation are good and in a number of firms designs are good too <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will know that i have only just taken over the portfolio i now hold <e> <s> nevertheless my understanding of the situation is not as he describes it <e> <s> it was not a united <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for all the sentiments he expressed to my predecessor and myself and i hope very much that what i have said will help to stop the scare to put it bluntly <e>", "<cs> my lords first in relation to the noble lords final remarks of course we support all practical efforts towards arms control which are safe <e> <s> turning to the noble lords opening remarks the immense importance of accidents clearly has not been ignored by her majestys government nor i believe by any of the governments of the nuclear powers <e> <s> the seriousness of a possible accident is so great that i think it is not an exaggeration to say that the safety measures the recording measures a register of even tiny mishaps that take place are i understand matters that are carried out by all the nuclear powers <e> <s> i believe that exchange which her majestys government would certainly support is carried out effectively in particular in the case of the united states where <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for all those sentiments with which i agree <e> <s> i would add merely the statement that i have already made that since there has been only one such accident in the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the noble lords question in detail but on the information that i have i am absolutely clear that we have never been in a situation anywhere near the kind of accident of which he speaks <e> <s> i think that i have already said enough about the factual situation to allay fears which i am sure noble lords would not wish to stir up <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe in a free press for good and for ill <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall take the noble lords advice as part of my necessary education process but on the point regarding the registration of accidents i assure him that this is being done most meticulously <e>", "<cs> my lords the seriousness of atomic warfare is of course understood by all in the house <e> <s> i cannot myself understand how the noble lord could read the report to which his question refers and which i have read myself and still maintain any alarm whatsoever <e> <s> as my predecessor has explained before now there are many immediate checks and cross-checks human and mechanical and there are many stages of conference after an apparently ambiguous set of data appears on a warning system <e> <s> on no occasion has retaliatory action been even considered <e> <s> i quote from the report on which the noble lord bases his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome having to reply to the question that way round <e> <s> i believe the systems and cross-checks are so numerous that the real attack would be quickly verified here and in many places in the united states but there would still be more than one investigatory and precautionary stage when aeroplanes might take off well before any final decisions for retaliatory action were even considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a separate question which has also been answered many times <e> <s> her majestys government will support any steps towards the practical control and limitation of atomic weapons but the operative word is practical <e>", "<cs> my lords our security is the realisation and i believe that our potential enemies are realistic that if a button were pressed light-heartedly the retribution would be such as to make sure that they did not do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am being very dense i have not fully understood the supplementary question put by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not realised that the noble baroness was referring to the question before the last <e> <s> i think that my noble friend the foreign secretary has taken every opportunity both unofficially and officially to look for ways of furthering the cause of practical control of nuclear weapons by all countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have answered that already <e> <s> i think we are satisfied that any potential enemy knows the serious consequences and takes the same careful measures as we take <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the two noble lords for their comments <e> <s> my predecessor has heard their comments <e> <s> i would only echo that in his usual <e>", "<cs> my lords i totally misunderstood the noble lord and the statement makes clear that over the period of three years the figure will be per cent <e> <s> over this year and next year it will be of the order of per cent <e> <s> this indeed is slightly less than the announced commitment in a huge programme where the exact out-turns and the exact control of this number of billions of pounds is as noble lords know better than i do not entirely easy <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal with the noble lords first and last comments before dealing with his rather longer comments about the appointment of ministers <e> <s> his first point was to ask whether i could confirm that there had been little or no change <e> <s> other than the statement made by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer in november to which i have already referred it was an important one it was a million adjustment due to the pressure on the programme caused by both the earlier delivery of military equipment and the greater costs of it i can confirm that we are on course in the main subject of course to the problems of the future to which i referred <e> <s> i was pleased to hear the noble lords reference at the end to the necessity of nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords first i wish to apologise to the noble lord lord shinwell for not answering his question on the numbers in the services and in particular in the territorial army <e> <s> the territorial army will increase in size in the coming year and it is certainly not our intention to do anything other than to sustain its very important place <e> <s> i have already covered the fact that the numbers in the army and navy will also increase <e> <s> recruiting is going forward well <e> <s> the effect of this statement is that we can and will be a little more selective in recruiting and shall take a little longer to reach established strengths <e> <s> i have partly answered the question asked by my noble friend lord orr-ewing in those terms but i would also assure him that the cash flow of industry is indeed very present in my mind particularly as a result of having been at the department of industry for the last months <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and gallant lord for those important observations and questions <e> <s> i thank him for pointing out that salt ii which the noble lord the leader of the opposition mentioned is between the united states and the soviet union <e> <s> it remains true that her majestys government will take every practical step towards the limitation and control of arms and the word practical of course covers noting very carefully the degree of preponderance of conventional weapons the soviet union currently has over the nato alliance which cannot be left out of the calculation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that observation <e>", "<cs> my lords our commitments to nato in europe have not been altered in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords the history of various countries is different <e> <s> we have long made a great contribution to the defence of the free world <e> <s> as a result we have a great deal of knowledge and skills in certain areas and i as an industrialist am clear that we get a tremendous fallout from our strong position know-how and skills in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords let me first say to the noble lord that as both my right honourable friend and i tried to explain on tuesday when making the statement in both houses these so-called cuts are not cuts but a trim of what was going to be clearly more than planned expenditure <e> <s> i do not think that is so particularly funny <e> <s> if you find as i said on tuesday that the prices of sophisticated weapons systems have escalated to a major degree and that you are keeping up your increase of expenditure in real terms in terms of constant prices then you are not cutting <e> <s> what you are doing is ensuring that you do not overspend your plans by an amount which you cannot afford <e> <s> that was the purport of my right honourable friends statement on tuesday <e> <s> but i do not want to dwell on tuesday <e>", "<cs> my lords the estimated billion to billion over the -year period of the capital costs of trident approximates to per cent <e> <s> of our defence budget <e> <s> that is approximately in line with the cost of polaris during the capital cost period <e> <s> the operating costs are also comparable <e> <s> we see the trident and the nuclear deterrent part of our defence programme as being part of a total programme which has been well explained on many occasions <e> <s> if your potential enemies in the alliance have a vast preponderance of conventional forces which are increasing in my view the importance of the nuclear deterrent is self-evident <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will study the statement issued by my right honourable friend yesterday i think he will find that there is a balance of stress on the importance of the vital new weapon systems and of the men of the army and the territorial army which i also referred to yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot go further in reply to the question that the noble lord has tabled today <e> <s> if he wishes to table a particular <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot go further than my first answer <e> <s> the government will not give an undertaking that these forces will not he deployed anywhere in the united kingdom for i think fairly obvious strategical reasons and reasons of security <e> <s> nevertheless the first part of the previous answer of my noble friend lord strathcona makes clear that the normal dispersal of these weapons is by road to a distance of to miles <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for those questions <e> <s> yes there is an enormous preponderance of soviet theatre nuclear weapons in europe <e> <s> yes i believe it is very important to the whole alliance that the countries in it and ultimately five countries in europe in the alliance should he prepared to allow these weapons to be deployed <e> <s> at the moment the main american long-range theatre nuclear weapon in europe the fi-ii is of course deployed only in this country and therefore this modernisation programme will spread the basing of these weapons to a greater extent <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will agree with me that the security of the united kingdom and its allies is the dominant question here <e> <s> i cannot go any further than i have already answered in relation to the likelihood of dispersing these weapons to any part of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords we all agree i think or nearly all agree with those sentiments <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the noble lord as to exactly when the government released this news <e> <s> i ought to be able to and i shall write to the noble lord to tell him <e> <s> i think it happened before my day <e> <s> in relation to the changing situation so far as public opinion is concerned the public opinion polls have been studied and many different answers to hypothetical questions were given <e> <s> her majestys government are clear that the british people properly faced with the facts and not if i may say so with a degree of wishful thinking which is sometimes placed before them will react to the absolute need to keep this country strong in every relevant respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the noble lord even within the terms of his tacit assumptions is correct the production of the necessary material for nuclear weapons would take place before a nuclear war <e> <s> but the whole purpose of our possession of nuclear weapons within an alliance and particularly with the united states is to ensure that no war takes place and furthermore that we cannot be coerced to surrender because we do not have those facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of my noble friends supplementary is that we anticipate that these facilities which is a new building within a compound where existing facilities con <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can add to the answers i have already given <e> <s> i believe the majority of experts who have a real knowledge both of defence strategies and the alternatives in these areas are of a mind which fully supports the policy on which her majestys government are continuing <e> <s> so far as future governments are concerned i believe we shall have satisfactory governments who will put the security of the nation above all else <e>", "<cs> we agree my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord feels that we have not furnished that information <e> <s> i think it comes clearly through the white papers which we have published and will publish again and i think it came clearly through the statement that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence made on th january <e> <s> for instance we <e>", "<cs> my lords to deal with the last and important point first we do not give highly secret information i am still sufficient of a new boy not to have the classifications fully clear to people who have not been vetted <e> <s> on the general point of whether we can do better in providing both houses of parliament with more information i will take the noble lords point <e> <s> i already have it in mind to see whether we can do better in relation to this house <e> <s> there will of course be opportunities for debates and i will do my best to ensure that the maximum information is available for those debates <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are determined to maintain both our nuclear and conventional capabilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly agree with the noble lord that keeping leads in technology is of vital importance both to our defence effort and to some of our more advanced industries <e> <s> as your lordships know very well it is also true that in the industrial and defence world of the size that it is today against the size of britain within that world it is a struggle to keep leads in certain areas and we cannot possibly maintain leads in each and every area <e> <s> having said that i do not think for the reasons that i have really given in my answer to the noble lord lord shinwell that my noble friend is right in suggesting that the trident expenditure can be regarded as expenditure which is likely to make it harder to keep leads in high technology <e> <s> the programme is as i have said and it will take some while to work up to it only per cent <e> <s> of the defence budget <e> <s> that is the capital cost of trident over the period until the mid-s <e> <s> in any event there is considerable high technology in the building of the submarines for the trident missiles and an estimated per cent <e> <s> of the work that will go into the four-boat force will be produced in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords of course if we removed any part of our defence programme we should have more within a given budget to spend on other things <e> <s> over the period we shall have spent on the tornado programme in total capital costs more than we plan to spend on trident <e> <s> so as i tried to indicate in my answer to the noble lord lord shinwell at per cent <e> <s> of our defence budget there is i suggest an undue focus on trident <e> <s> it is to maintain our strategic nuclear deterrent <e> <s> the costs are in line with the polaris costs and we believe that it is absolutely vital to maintain the deterrent in the strategic area and our own contribution to the american deterrent in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> we must keep a balanced force and we will continue to increase our spend in real terms in the way that we have done since we came to office <e> <s> may i say to the noble lord lord gladwyn that indeed there are these opportunities <e> <s> the only reason why i did not rise to answer his question was that i agree with him that they will provide a longer opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question is ever present in the minds of all our experts at the head of the services and of the technical advisers in the ministry of defence and elsewhere <e> <s> we believe that the trident is the best choice and the most likely to be invulnerable for a very long while to come <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no plans to place such orders <e> <s> the speculative construction of warships is a matter for the commercial judgment of the shipbuilders concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence made clear in his statement on th january there is a substantial warship building programme under way at british shipbuilders with warships under construction or on order including the eight ordered by the present government <e> <s> the number of orders beyond the present period and the workload for british shipbuilders in the future are under constant study both by british shipbuilders and by my right honourable friend at the department of industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and gallant lord is of course correct the lack of competitiveness of british shipbuilders has made it very hard for them to get a fair share of world trade <e> <s> part of their problem has been the depressed state of the shipbuilding industry all over the world but part of it undoubtedly has been loss of a share of the market through lack of competitiveness <e> <s> it is not quite true to say that no ships have been sold but certainly far too few ships have been sold <e>", "<cs> my lords in containing the over-expenditure of our budget wherever possible we have had to save without affecting central operational efficiency and the particular cuts in fuel supplies to the armed forces have been as advised by the armed forces themselves in order to maintain essential training requirements and also essential minimum operational requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the noble lords feelings on an important aspect for the territorial army <e> <s> it is not that they have not been allowed any petrol at all nor has training been cut to a nil level <e> <s> we were faced with an over-expenditure of serious proportions on a budget which was increased in real terms and in those circumstances and in the short-term the only thing to do was to consult the services on cuts which could be made which in their opinion did not affect essential operational efficiency and training <e> <s> that is what we have done <e>", "<cs> my lords we are currently undertaking a review of these allowances to ensure that they compensate adequately but not over-generously for the extra cost of living that they are intended to meet <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends point is fully taken in relation to letting standards deteriorate and for that reason the policy overall is to ensure that essential maintenance of living accommodation to an overall standard is continued <e> <s> we have nevertheless had to impose a period of severe restraint on works expenditure except in the cases of the most important building projects <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that we will not cut below the minimum operational requirements that the services consider absolutely necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot satisfy the noble lord on that detailed point but i will let him know <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that follows at all <e> <s> i think there are essential minimums and desirable standards in almost every area of life <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble and gallant lord believes that that was an unsatisfactory reply i have indeed had detailed discussions with the services to see whether i could make it a more informed one <e> <s> the fact is that the policy of trying to curtail the over-expenditure on the defence budget means that only after the event will one be able to work out details of the kind that the noble lord asks for <e> <s> so far as the flying hours are concerned i think it is well known that the nato guide on minimum hours is an average hours a month and we shall maintain that level as an absolute minimum <e> <s> so far as exercises generally are concerned some lower priority exercises have been curtailed but major exercises which as the noble lord knows include crusader have been maintained at normal level <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the detail of my noble friends question without notice but i will write to him on that detail <e> <s> i think that in general all i can say once again is that there is a difference between what we acknowledge is a thoroughly desirable level for operational training and a minimum which one has with some reluctance been forced to adopt in order to curtail within reasonable bounds and reasonable may be a slightly unwise word the over-expenditure on an already increased defence budget <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring to crusader i believe that this exercise was in effect thoroughly successful it showed that in the main we were able to increase the effective defence in europe roughly according to plan <e> <s> yes the purpose of the exercise was to highlight shortcomings <e> <s> some shortcomings were highlighted and some of them have a training application and where these are a priority they will still be included <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not one to argue with my noble friend as to the exact correctness of a nato guide advised i think by all experts in this area that hours a month should be the minimum <e> <s> that is what is advised as the minimum and we shall not drop below it and as soon as we possibly can we shall increase it <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of the noble lords historical lesson <e>", "<cs> to deal with the second point first my lords it is not of course possible directly to compare civilian life with that of the armed forces and in so far as part of the improvements we had intended to bring in involved the sale of surplus married quarters that could clearly apply only to a certain amount of the property owned by the services <e> <s> to answer the first part of my noble friends supplementary about giving high priority we certainly regarded it as a desirable scheme but within the well-discussed necessity to keep the defence budget within limits we have had to postpone some of the non-essential aspects <e> <s> the armed services review body takes account of all the differences between civilian life and army life in the reviews it makes in relation to pay where our essential commitment stands <e>", "<cs> that is true my lords but part of the proposals had been to increase the advances which some of the services already give on an interest-free basis for servicemen to buy houses in the ordinary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure i follow the thinking of the noble lord in that supplementary question but i will read carefully in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be right by way of question and answer to go into the degree to which and on what terms commercial firms give advances <e> <s> as i said there are major differences between civilian life and the armed forces and we believe they are all taken into account in our reviews of service conditions <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that suggestion my lords <e> <s> we are already in contact with other government departments and every step is taken to ensure that servicemen look ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as there is surplus accommodation and we are constantly reviewing that our priority is to sell it but to give first priority to service families <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to write to the noble earl in regard to the existing schemes and since the proposed schemes were never in fact authorised i do not have figures for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can add to the answers i have given <e> <s> differences are involved <e> <s> so far as the employment market is concerned certainly even in present conditions a number of servicemen are very valuable to civilian life in particular those who have a craft <e>", "<cs> my lords i need the indulgence of the house being only a little over a month old in this particular job and having originally volunteered for political service only in terms of industrial knowledge which i have had on a full-time basis for years <e> <s> however i have already learned that there is perhaps an industrial contribution to be made to solving the problems of the enormous escalation of costs of sophi <e>", "<cs> i was just coming to that my lords <e> <s> the whole question of nato reinforcements in an emergency is under renewed study at the moment <e> <s> the discussions have to be with the united states air force because the auxiliary squadrons are there for support of their own air force <e> <s> my noble friends point will be taken note of and in the discussions we shall keep it in mind and see the degree to which that can augment the reinforcement measures which nato will have to make sure are applicable to the current threat <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked for the indulgence of the house in the previous debate <e> <s> i ask for it even more in this debate with the degree of knowledge of such formidable speakers as my wartime brigadier the noble and gallant lord lord carver <e> <s> nevertheless i will enter into this with gusto <e> <s> i think that one has to start an answer on behalf of her majestys government on the note that the noble lord lord peart has just struck <e> <s> of course we want arms control and disarmament <e> <s> i shall not weary the house with our record but i have it here in terms of test ban treaties non-proliferation treaties in chemical warfare and biological warfare at vienna geneva new york and madrid and in terms of struggling for arms control in a balanced way for which the late lord louis mountbatten asked <e> <s> so there is no question about that <e> <s> but as a newcomer to this game one is beginning to recognise the array of people who are not unilateralists but who nevertheless use the phrase we must multilaterally disarm <e> <s> that of course as the noble lord has said takes the other side as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come to the question of cost and the part that trident plays in our defence budget in a moment <e> <s> the next point in relation to whether we should not leave it all to the americans is the point of having a second decision centre of course acting in virtually every situation of which one can conceive at the moment in liaison with the usa <e> <s> nevertheless the existence of that second centre of decision does have a bearing on the russian perception of what reckless gamble as the aggressor they might decide upon <e>", "<cs> my lords the government still do not believe for reasons which perhaps will become more apparent as i deal with the question of moving from polaris to trident that the continuation of this country holding an effective independent nuclear deterrent will in any way cause further proliferation though further proliferation is of course of concern to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can try to answer the noble lord lord kaldor shortly <e> <s> deter is the operative word <e> <s> our intention is to deter war <e> <s> to deter a potential aggressor from war we need all the feasible options <e> <s> in that part of my speech when i was referring to certain weapons not being first strike weapons i was referring to a suggestion made by i think lord chalfont that trident with its extreme accuracy looked as though it was a weapon to take out the enemys nuclear sites <e> <s> i have pointed out that in fact it did not have that accuracy and that it was in no way intended to change the nature of the british deterrent submarine-based an invulnerable base so that they know we have got it and so that they know that if they adopt first strike we can reply to it <e> <s> so far as concerns the use of nuclear weapons of different kinds within the various options i can do no better than say that we have to have and be known to have the capability of using all those options if we are to deter the aggressor <e>", "<cs> my lords on rd march mr browns chief administrative officer wrote to him and refused him permission to appear on the programme <e> <s> under the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i did not deal with the noble lords supplementary question about mr browns reply which was dated th march to his chief administrative officer <e> <s> it was received on th march by which time the programme had been recorded <e> <s> but the position remains unaltered all civil servants are not allowed to take part in public programmes involving the disclosure or the use of information obtained through their official duties without having permission and in this case permission was not granted <e> <s> so far as mr browns personal position is concerned i cannot go further than my earlier answer <e> <s> there is nothing in the penalty that forbids mr brown being promoted if that were recommended in respect of any particular post <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government do not believe that this case is in any way the kind of case that the armitage committee mentioned in its recommendations <e> <s> the reason i say that is indeed because the armitage committee made it clear that they would expect civil servants who had been granted permission to serve as local councillors or in other political appointments to continue to follow the rules in the code of conduct <e> <s> the procedures for appeal are open to mr brown as they are to the whole of the rest of the civil service and since in fact the right of appeal against his reprimand is still open at this present time i would much prefer not to make any further comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord particularly as i have to say that mr browns department has had occasion in the past to warn mr brown that he must comply strictly with the rules on the disclosure of official information and on dealings with the media <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no intention of sweeping any matter under the carpet <e> <s> the government the previous government in fact appointed sir edward pochin and his committee in connection with the whole subject-matter upon which mr brown has been commenting so there is no intention to sweep anything under the carpet at all <e> <s> the two cases are entirely different <e> <s> not only would i agree with the previous supplementary question but every civilian organisation that i have ever known and i have been in business all my life makes it very clear that its managers do not appear on public programmes or write to newspapers on matters in relation to which they have obtained the information from their official duties <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that perhaps the technical description would be less emotive than the term neutron bomb has become <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have no intention of manufacturing the neutron bomb and are not doing any development work upon it <e> <s> it is being considered again along with every other aspect of united states defence by the new administration and they have promised to consult their allies as a result of any conclusions they reach <e> <s> so far as deployment is concerned i would say to the noble lord that apparently the main purpose perceived by military commanders is in deployment against massed formations of tank offensives <e> <s> that clearly indicates a deployment in the regions where such an attack is liable rather than in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i think all weapons and above all nuclear weapons are so horrific as almost to defy imagination <e> <s> i do not think there is anybody in her majestys government or in this house who does not think that and i do not think that the noble lord if i may say so has any monopoly of thoughts in that direction nor any monopoly of working towards arms control on a balanced basis <e>", "<cs> my lords it is believed that they know how to make such weapons but i invite your lordships to consider the role that military commanders see for such a weapon to use against a massed armoured attack and that it is clear that the russians are not expecting a massed armoured attack from the west <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not in my own memory but my father speaking at the cambridge union in said that the aeroplane was the most offensive weapon ever invented and that if he had the casting vote he would say abolish the air <e> <s> he did not have the casting vote and we cannot disinvent nuclear weapons either <e>", "<cs> my lords i think our allies the united states with their military advisers and her majestys government with all their military advisers are quite capable of considering all the pluses and minuses of these awkward but necessary decisions to be taken in the world in which we live <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the first part of the noble lords suggestion in his supplementary question is a statement of military appreciation as it stands <e> <s> what i intended to convey in one of my answers in relation to the second part was that if the perceived military use of this weapon is of a tactical nature to destroy particularly a large-scale offensive of tanks then its applicability clearly is to those who see a threat of a large-scale attack of armoured vehicles and i do not think that the russians do see such a threat <e> <s> in the hope that we have reached the end of this subject i just want to take the opportunity of saying once more that the americans are only considering this weapon along with all their other weapon options at a moment when they are reviewing their defences and at a moment when they are reviewing a possible initiative to continue the salt arms control discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all weapons that are being considered by the alliance are for defensive purposes <e> <s> on this one i want to say again that there is no current us intention <e> <s> there is a statement that they are considering it and that they will consult us if their considerations lead anywhere at all <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier it is a question of degree <e> <s> the noble viscount is quite correct <e> <s> the radiation effect is greater but the blast is smaller <e> <s> i cannot comment on the exact figures that the noble viscount mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords estimated trident expenditure in the year is expected to be in the order of about million <e> <s> it is not possible to predict at this stage with any accuracy expenditure in <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been over this ground in reply to questions which the noble lord and other noble lords have asked and indeed in the debate which he mentioned <e> <s> i believe that it is not a case of the government dismissing the very interesting well argued points of view which were raised in that debate <e> <s> i believe we have answered them and i hope i shall get further opportunities to answer them in more detail <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has at his fingertips the exact cost of the number of hawks concerned and i do not but the figures are as i have described <e> <s> it would have allowed million more next year although we have an overspend of our budget this year which the noble lord also knows quite well <e> <s> but if the overspend on an expanding budget were to be maintained at the level at which it is then we should have million more for other uses <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a separate question which i shall be glad to answer if my noble friend will put it down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving me this opportunity of going into a fraction more detail than i was able to in reply to the debate introduced by the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords in the debate on th february and in the debate since then in another place the question of costs has been gone into in depth <e> <s> i believe that that is another question and if the noble lord would like to put it down i should very much welcome the opportunity of once more stating in detail the fact that we believe this to be the most economic answer for maintaining an effective british strategic deterrent through the nineties and into the next century <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for those supplementary questions <e> <s> we did have a very good and deep debate introduced by the noble lord lord chalfont a week or two ago <e> <s> i believe that in this house we should be able to get very much closer to an agreed view and i shall certainly work both in the house and with the committees of the house in trying to arrive at that situation <e> <s> i agree entirely with the noble lord that there is no need to cast doubt either on the current effectiveness of our polaris deterrent or in my view on the effectiveness of the modernisation of that deterrent which will come in with trident <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that the noble lord has himself intervened <e> <s> yes i am talking of the c trident i missile which is the missile about which we have reached agreement in principle with the united states including broad estimates of costs on which our cost estimates are based for the continuation of the british strategic independent deterrent <e> <s> the trident ii missile to which the noble lord now refers and i am glad to have if i have it his confirmation that it was to this missile that he was referring in his debate is still very much at the development stage <e> <s> i understand from the united states defense department that its full characteristics are not yet entirely decided and it has not been the subject to date of any discussions between her majestys government and the united states <e> <s> i should not like to rule out such a strategic missile for this country for all time but the decision so far is to modernise and keep effective to the same degree of deterrence as we have had in the past through the nineties and into the next century <e>", "<cs> my lords that again if i may say so is a separate question and not one to which we have addressed ourselves at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will allow me to keep my powder dry for a separate question on the matter of costs i will answer in detail at that time <e> <s> but certainly the tornado programme has been more expensive or will have been more expensive than the estimates of the trident i deal overall <e> <s> certainly we believe that the trident i deal is perfectly accommodatable if that is not a terrible word in terms of our defence budget as a whole in more or less the same way as we have accommodated polaris and previous independent deterrents <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the retention of polaris had been an effective alternative to trident then it is true to say as my noble friend indicated that in the eighties it would have been cheaper <e> <s> however to look at the nineties united states production of polaris will almost certainly have ceased by then <e> <s> the missiles would then become a more expensive option than trident <e> <s> the united states stocks of missiles are older than ours <e> <s> motors and other parts would need renewing but production lines would have closed <e> <s> submarines are the major part of the expense and the navys experience has led to conventional submarines being scrapped after years for sound economic reasons <e> <s> it looks as though the same will hold for nuclear submarines <e> <s> the force as a whole will be years old in <e> <s> new polaris boats with all their missile-related equipment would show little if any difference in cost compared with trident boats so by the end of the century even the costs would not be dissimilar <e> <s> by then as government have made clear before the polaris could well be too vulnerable and too ineffective in penetration to continue its role <e>", "<cs> my lords the government completely agree with the noble lords sentiment <e>", "<cs> we entirely agree my lords <e> <s> cost cannot of course be left out of these questions <e> <s> money and resources are not unlimited <e>", "<cs> my lords that question has previously been asked and answered in this house and in a sense is a separate question <e> <s> however as i said earlier we are continuing to spend a not dissimilar amount on maintaining our strategic deterrent <e> <s> it is a small part of the defence expenditure as a whole <e> <s> we regard it as an integral and essential part <e>", "<cs> my lords i have previously spoken on the navys experience and our assessment of how long the existing boats could be maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been decided that caledonia will be retained as a naval shore establishment <e> <s> until extra facilities are provided at sultan the apprentice training task will continue to be carried out at hms caledonia <e> <s> when apprentice training eventually transfers to hms sultan hms caledonia will continue to be used for other rn tasks <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i cannot fully satisfy my noble friend in relation to her supplementary question <e> <s> her majestys government have decided that this apprentice training task would be better accommodated in the future at sultan <e> <s> the reason for that decision is that modern training facilities and equipment are extremely expensive and consolidating at sultan would seem to be the option that would prove the most cost-effective <e> <s> however i shall take note of my noble friends views on the suitability of hms caledonia for clearly a number of purposes arising from its attributes which she has mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend clearly knows hms sultan is located just by portsmouth and is therefore on the south coast <e> <s> i do not think that the navy would accept my noble friends charge <e> <s> rosyth caledonia being close by is a very important naval establishment and her majestys government and the royal navy are determined to continue to use caledonia albeit for purposes which better suit their overall plans <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i think that we have been over those matters before in terms of the short-term budget in relation to expenditure problems which are not connected with this particular decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can say to my noble friend that neither of those two statements surprises either me or the ministry of defence because we are in fact in touch with both councils <e> <s> my noble friend spoke of their estimate or guess of the numbers who might be interested in living in this area but that still has to be confirmed <e> <s> as regards my noble friends question as to whether we would be prepared to sell we are not able to do that at the moment until we have the longer term plans for the reorganisation of tidworth a lot clearer than we have them at the present time <e> <s> the same applies of course to long leases <e> <s> but as i have said we are prepared to look at and to discuss with the local authorities what more can be done in the short-term <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baronesss starting point is exactly the same as mine when i first heard of this matter <e> <s> there is a requirement in the short-term for really urgent operational reasons to demolish the of which i have spoken <e> <s> we are dealing with approximately houses <e> <s> the noble baroness has just heard my noble friend describe the number of possible tentative inquiries from people who live in this district which cover only a very small proportion of the houses which are not under a demolition order at the present time and which may be reprieved on a permanent basis in so far as the local need for housing can be reconciled with operational requirements <e> <s> the government are trying to ensure the maximum degree of reconciliation so that we do not leave unhoused families who would accept accommodation in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not just a question of security though the operational requirements of every barracks are different <e> <s> my right honourable friend the under-secretary of state for the army has himself visited this area and looked at the practical problems of housing civilians within a barracks or a barracks on one side and a training area on the other a training area used by night as well as by day <e> <s> so that there really are major problems <e> <s> as regards the noble lords point about other council houses being occupied by current members of the forces i should like to look into that a little further <e> <s> my information is that while the local councils have housed retired members of the forces and are housing a number of widows or deserted wives and families they have not in fact used council accommodation for active serving members <e> <s> but i should just like to check that in relation to the test valley area <e> <s> i have checked it in relation to the kennet <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for their supplementary information on the details of the tidworth area <e> <s> i will look into the details which they have raised <e> <s> we remain i think in the situation that for the vast bulk of houses of this kind in this area they are old houses and fairly small we have not got at the moment a demand for even one-half <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have tried to explain the barracks and the houses are on one side while on the other side there is the training area which is used both night and day for mixed training including tanks and infantry carrying vehicles <e> <s> it is a mixed force barracks <e> <s> both the vehicles and the people proceed from the barracks across to the training area and back again <e> <s> one of the reasons why the demand for accommodation may be a bit limited is the noise that this creates including at night <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct in saying that italy has recently decided in favour of the joint studies with the united kingdom aimed at establishing the feasibility of this collaboration <e> <s> in regard to the market i am delighted to hear what my noble friend says particularly in relation to the civil side of that market and his view of the degree to which we might capture a share of it <e> <s> that is indeed the kind of desirable market approach we need from industry if the costs of these highly sophisticated projects which escalate so much between one generation and another are to be ably handled <e>", "<cs> my lords i would rather not do that at this stage before the joint feasibility study has even been decided upon <e>", "<cs> my lords what my noble friend says is noted <e> <s> the benefits of international co-operation are indeed very real and it is essential that we should make them work <e> <s> i think the history to date has been that some have worked much better than others <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence has explained in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the prime ministers recent visit is concerned the prime minister will be making a statement at a time which she finds appropriate <e> <s> so far as the question of arms for the <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that two things take place in this kind of area and both in their own field are thoroughly healthy <e> <s> there is competition both national and international and there is at times collaboration <e> <s> for instance a number of aircraft which we have ordered in this country are the result of collaborative ventures and any sales of those aircraft are the subject of the collaborative agreements which have been made <e> <s> but in the case of the hawk aircraft which was referred to in relation to the prime ministers recent trip this is a wholly british aircraft and is the finest trainer-cum-strike aircraft in the world <e> <s> so i think that both competition and co-operation each in its right place are correct policies <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can add to what my right honourable friend the secretary of state said in the other place on th march before he went on his middle east tour in relation to the mobile force where we have promised within the severe limitations of our capability co-operation with our major allies the americans <e> <s> we do not envisage that this force even when it is available should be used other than at the request of friendly nations and in accordance with their agreement <e> <s> so i hope i can assure the noble lord on that <e> <s> on the question of bases there is so far as i know no consideration at the present time of any land base in the middle east although our ally the united states and the noble lord will be aware of the recent visit of secretary haig has been discussing with the countries of the middle east what would be their wishes against a <e>", "<cs> my lords a decision on the choice of a new heavyweight torpedo for the royal navy will be taken later this year <e> <s> two options are currently being studied a british development by marconi space and defence systems limited drawing on the technology used in sting ray and a united states development of their mark torpedo <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that all those considerations will be taken into account in any decisions which we come to this year <e> <s> i note what my noble friend says in relation to foreign equipment perhaps proving to be more expensive than was at first thought <e> <s> but i believe that the experience of the staff in the ministry of defence is well up to making a realistic assessment of all these factors and of the practicality of offset <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is generally recognised by the experts concerned and we hope very much that other countries will also do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say to the noble and learned lord that the linking of the torpedo decision with the trident decision which has been well aired both in this house and in the other place on many occasions is not relevant <e> <s> so far as the costs of the torpedo are concerned i am not at present in a position to reveal these <e> <s> there are two contenders and their bids in relation to both cost and technicality are being examined <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the points which my noble friend has made <e>", "<cs> my lords in the noble lord clearly i have an expert in the technicalities of torpedoes <e> <s> therefore i shall not attempt to argue with the noble lord though i promise to write to him <e> <s> all the experts in the services and in the ministry of defence believe that a new generation of heavy torpedo is essential to our national security <e>", "<cs> my lords those considerations which the noble lord lord beswick has raised are of course always at the back of our minds <e> <s> i wish it were true that in every case of alternative supplies offered costs were nearly the same <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> whatever we did to the defence budget there is not room to put all the million unemployed even if that were a practical figure for employment into the defence industries <e> <s> however we are well aware of the employment benefits of the defence industries of their high technology and of the need to buy british wherever that is the practical course to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble baroness is disappointed with the answer <e> <s> my right honourable friend has already made clear in public that he attaches great importance to the territorial army and that its function role and size are being reviewed in the long-term costing exercise which he is currently engaged in forming <e> <s> the noble baroness said that whatever way it was looked at we were bringing down the number of training days <e> <s> i do not know whether that will prove to be so but if it does it will be by a very marginal amount <e> <s> in fact although in past years the entitlement to training days for units has been in the actual uptake averaged in it averaged and in we have allocated to units districts have one training day up their sleeves and we have a fraction up our sleeve in the centre as well <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first wish the noble lord the leader of the opposition many happy returns of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords having wished him a happy birthday may i then say to the noble lord that i do not think on the aspect of my answer to the noble baroness i can tell him that i will reconsider it but what i will certainly say is that i am sure that the role of the territorial army will be brought forward in future defence debates <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is not quite correct in that <e> <s> indeed very recently we have agreed to increase the flexibility for the current year <e> <s> the entitlement was days but it was never taken up it is now to be days of which and this figure has always been the same are obligatory and are voluntary <e> <s> commanding officers have always had discretion in relation to the voluntary days and we have recently agreed that they can be flexible in relation to four man days of the obligatory kind <e>", "<cs> my lords this comes in a further area of the cos flexibility <e> <s> we have asked cos in order to contain the over-expenditure of our budget in regard to which the ta <e> <s> is being asked to do slightly less than the rest of the army to consider the various types of training days and the degree to which they can help to contain the budget in the manner suggested by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have made clear that the average number of man training days used by units in the last two years has been and and that we have allocations this year which at maximum reached <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to the noble lords first point i have yet to study the report <e> <s> the press reports suggested certain problems in the development programme which is what development programmes are for <e> <s> i have already said that the united states have confidence in this programme they have the utmost confidence in it <e> <s> as regards arms control i would say to the noble lord that he is correct of course in saying that the new american administration have now stated their clear intention to resume the talks on theatre nuclear weapons which started in october last year and started in the opinion of most of us only when nato announced the modernisation of its theatre nuclear weapons <e> <s> to say that the future talks which will be resumed this year should be a reason for cancelling the modernisation of our theatre nuclear weapon programme is not justified <e> <s> the noble lord will have noticed that three-quarters of the sample of the recent marplan poll believe that britain should either maintain or improve its nuclear capability and that is the policy of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that either this country or the united states have anything to be ashamed about in relation to efforts to get practical talks of an arms control nature going and have a large number of successes without which the situation would have been very much worse <e>", "<cs> my lords i would only say to the noble lord the leader of the opposition that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord kennet is making play on the word missiles <e> <s> there are american bombers stationed in this country and their bases just as the bases for the operation of these cruise missiles are the subject of joint decision at a time of emergency <e> <s> so i do not think that the noble lords anxieties are real <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes an assumption in the latter part of his question to which i do not intend to address myself <e> <s> as my right honourable friend the secretary of state made clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the noble lord feels that there is a degree of arrogance in my answer but it is not as though this question has not been discussed in debates in the other place and on questions in this house including one put down by the noble lord for written answer i have a list but i will not weary the house which numbers nine occasions this year when this subject has been discussed or answered on questions <e> <s> hence my feeling that for the time being and until some of the options which my right honourable friend has explained are being studied have been studied to pursue this question is a little superfluous <e>", "<cs> my lords my copy of the question which is a printed one says million which is of course billion <e>", "<cs> my lords to take the second question first i point out that it has been made clear in the debates on this matter in this house and also by my right honourable friend on numerous occasions that the decision to date has been to buy trident i this was well discussed in the debate raised in this house by the noble lord lord chalfont and followed by a special question although for the moment i cannot remember the name of the noble lord who asked it <e> <s> i think that the estimate that was made last year and which has been updated to a small degree by my right honourable friend refers to trident i that has been made entirely clear and the main areas of the options that we are still looking at have also been made clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for drawing our attention to that fact <e> <s> certainly other estimates have been completed in accordance with original estimates <e> <s> so i know of no reason at this stage why this estimate which is not an exact figure should not be taken as the best estimate available at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords the correct figure is billion <e>", "<cs> my lords again i cannot go into the details which the noble lord with his experience knows in this particular field <e> <s> but our shipbuilding design capability and with that goes estimation capability is i think efficient <e> <s> i wish that one could say that the whole of our shipbuilding industry was thoroughly competitive but internationally our design capability and our experts on shipbuilding are regarded as being certainly equal to any in the world and possibly superior and in the main it is they who have made this estimate because the main part of this cost is of course for the submarines to be built in british yards <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and gallant lord knows well i would not <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his congratulations <e> <s> first of all as my initial answer was intended to imply we are firm on the increase in real terms of the budget by approximately per cent <e> <s> per annum the estimate currently being per cent <e> <s> over three years <e> <s> so far as the revision of the estimate is concerned as a result of the long-term review this stems from the over-expenditure of the current budget which as i have said is being increased and that in turn stems from the escalation of costs of modern equipment combined with the ever-changing threat backed by modern technology <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate and indeed endorse the noble lords sentiment that defence should be kept as far as is possible above party <e> <s> so far as the noble lords second supplementary about maritime strength is concerned there is no question but that we have to meet all the possible threats from our potential enemies including the maritime area <e> <s> the review against the background of the huge escalating costs of modern equipment is how best to do that <e> <s> i do not think i can go any further at this stage in anticipating the outcome of the current long-term review <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lords question is really relevant to the situation <e> <s> we are not cutting <e> <s> we are increasing defence expenditure far more than previous governments have done and shall continue to do it <e> <s> it is a question of how to allocate that increase <e> <s> so far as the morale of the services is concerned including the royal navy which will have an important role and its submarine role for sure is expanding i believe that it is much higher than is anticipated and i say that against a short background of having been the minister for the navy as well as the minister of defence procurement for a week <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i can be clearer on this point <e> <s> the numbers in our services since say have come down very materially as weaponry has become much more formidable and much more costly <e> <s> this is the central long-term problem apart from various short-term problems <e> <s> this is the inevitable evolution of technology and the awesome power of modern weapons <e> <s> as such there will be changes and there will be some cuts in numbers of some parts of the services but the overall situation is that our budget is being increased by per cent <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state in the review he is carrying out has the greatest sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the leader of the opposition and the noble lord lord gladwyn for their remarks and particularly for agreeing that for the major part of our discussion we should await the day of the debate <e> <s> i apologise for the length of the statement but i think the noble lord the leader of the opposition thought that no bad thing <e> <s> this is a matter of great importance so we felt that it was warranted <e>", "<cs> my lords the first point which the noble lord lord kennet made was that the expenditure on trident in the future i think he felt at the peak years would be at a crippling level <e> <s> i must mention that the expenditure on tornado over the whole period at million which is twice the estimate for trident merely shows that all modern weaponry is highly expensive <e> <s> in this comparison one has to realise that within the trident estimate we are including the whole cost of the bases including the bases ashore but that we are not including the airfield costs in the tornado cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord beswick for his initial remarks <e> <s> so far as the avb is concerned the reason for the wording in the statement is that we are not quite at the end of the negotiations <e> <s> the intention i believe of all parties is that it should be pretty nearly exactly a per cent <e> <s> share of the production of the whole order bearing in mind that the total number of aircraft required is some and that the united kingdom order is only approximately of that number <e> <s> so there are still some negotiating points to be completed <e> <s> however after a recent visit of my own to washington i am satisfied that the combined intention in agreements which are not easy to put on paper is that it should be per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the right reverend prelate for his remarks <e> <s> we share his sadness about the closure of chatham and we also share his concern in relation to job numbers when we are at i believe the bottom of a recession <e> <s> i can tell him that my right honourable friend the secretary of state fitted in to todays programme before going to the house a meeting with the industrial and non-industrial unions representing the employees at chatham and agreed a special programme for full consultation over the next few years which we have to plan how this will be carried out <e> <s> i hope that during those years we shall see the continued growth which is already visible of a number of small businesses and of certain modern industries and we shall see the bottom out of the recession and hopefully some relief to the problem of job numbers all over the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i answer the noble and gallant lord with all his qualifications with some humility and i have no doubt that he will spell out his views in greater detail when the time comes for debate <e> <s> i would say to him that he suggested that the cut falls only and his phrase was on the royal navy <e> <s> this is a cut in numbers to offset the cost of the enhancement of fire power which modern weapons and the modern threat make necessary <e> <s> the suggested cut is in the surface fleet area <e> <s> expansions will continue in submarines and in maritime aircraft which have a major bearing on the roles which he will no doubt wish to raise in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his initial remarks <e> <s> he has indeed himself put the figures right in relation to a press srticle on the expenditure in america on trident indeed the proportion of expenditure in this country is slightly higher than the figure he has given <e> <s> he has also put his finger on the main problem in terms of the growing expense of equipment over and above the rate of inflation due to much more powerful and sophisticated equipment which has been running for many years at somewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord raised the question of the much greater anxiety caused by press speculation on what might come <e> <s> i very much hope that by bringing forward the date of this statement my right honourable friend will have relieved peoples minds from the worst forms of conjecture which seem inevitably to accompany this kind of examination <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord chalfont for his remarks on the general statement <e> <s> may i ask him to wait until the debate to go further into the detailed question he raised but to be assured that one of the reasons for our moving from polaris to trident according to a certain timetable and the discussions currently going on is to ensure that we do not run into expensive production hiatuses <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in what now clearly is a short second reading debate and i am particularly appreciative of all the supportive things that they have said about the purposes of the bill especially those voiced on behalf of the opposition by the noble lord lord brooks of tremorfa <e> <s> i will quickly run through the comments that have been made <e> <s> i would say to my noble friend lord bridgeman that the matters which he has raised do not directly refer to the armed forces bill that is before your lordships and if i may i should like to deal with them at the time of the debate on th july <e> <s> perhaps i may say to my noble friend lord mottistone that that is the date on which the white paper and the statement are due to be debated in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords these aircraft are somewhat elderly i think that my noble friend is correct in those adjectives but this is certainly not exceptional among extremely reliable aircraft of various kinds which we have had <e> <s> the flying hours of the queens flight andovers are far fewer than the average for the andovers used as communication aircraft in the royal air force <e> <s> in our view the safety record of the aeroplane is very high and as my noble friend has mentioned the maintenance is to an exceptionally high standard <e> <s> yes the government are confident that this is an extremely safe and reliable aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer that point except to say that i have flown quite often in the aircraft without experiencing any of the difficulty that has been mentioned <e> <s> i would take the opportunity to say that the question of the prestige of our royal family flying in the aircraft has been mentioned on previous occasions i think by my noble friend and i would remind the house that on long journeys abroad her majesty almost invariably flies in a vc <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that for the purpose for which the raf and for that matter the queens flight aircraft are used and for the conditions in which they are used the instruments are more than adequate <e> <s> i say again that the aircraft is extremely reliable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord with his past background of experience in the manufacture of superb modern aircraft will of course take the view that he has taken <e> <s> however i must remind him that if we are to meet the growing threat which we shall be talking about next monday we really must select the necessary enormously high-cost equipment <e> <s> regrettably this item comes lower down the priority list <e> <s> so far as other departments are concerned the whole government policy is still to try to cut further the undue proportion of national expenditure that is represented by public expenditure <e> <s> the defence budget is under great stress but so too are budgets of all other departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a reply in relation to the first part of my noble friends supplementary question <e> <s> i do not think that the aircraft mentioned is of the size normally required for queens flight operations neither is the hs <e> <s> the question of amalgamating the hs squadron with the rest of the communications squadron has attractions and has been looked at but that would still involve considerable additional cost in moving the aircraft and in servicing different aircraft at different places and it cannot claim priority at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my last answer in relation to two other aircraft covers that proposition as well <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has such experience of aircraft flying slower than bicyles that i would hesitate to take him on <e> <s> but i can assure him that i get to the west of scotland to visit coulport for instance i think in about an hour and a half and have a very nice meal on the way <e>", "<cs> my lords up to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble and gallant lord will permit me to ask him whether he <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord brooks of tremorfa for those kind words <e> <s> indeed in winding up the debate it is clearly impossible to deal with more than a tiny proportion of the many very valuable and knowledgeable contributions that the or speakers have made <e> <s> so will they all please accept my apologies in advance <e> <s> i shall go through the record carefully and where we can answer specific questions we shall do so in writing if as is inevitable i do not have time to answer tonight <e> <s> i also propose in the main to leave out the names of those noble lords who have made remarks since the repetition of a phrase such as the noble lord lord so-and-so of what-not would take quite some time <e>", "<cs> yes i am my lords <e> <s> indeed when i first went to the ministry of defence when i said when will we get to the day of one frigate or one aircraft <e> <s> everybody said well it will be in about years or years now shall we go on with business <e> <s> because that is precisely what they have <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said at this stage of the inquiry i do not want to make many further comments <e> <s> alvis were the manufacturers and they have not broken the law <e> <s> so far as the export is concerned at this stage of the investigation all i am prepared to say is that it appears that other firms may have exported these engines illegally <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am satisfied that the customs and excise controls on a basis of export licences do constitute an efficient system <e> <s> at this stage of the investigation i would rather not comment any further <e>", "<cs> my lords anticipating that question i have in fact tried to ascertain how long it is likely to take <e> <s> i cannot give a definitive answer but the investigations will be completed as soon as possible and they will be followed by the appropriate steps of a responsible government <e>", "<cs> my lords i very deliberately did not say exactly that <e> <s> the situation is now <e>", "<cs> my lords good progress has been made in the designing of the type and i am therefore relatively satisfied that we shall meet the operational requirements on time as well as within the cost estimates <e> <s> in regard to my noble friends second supplementary question are we over-designing <e> <s> i would say that he will know as will many other members of the house that this is a constant question which my predecessors of both parties have examined and which we are also examining as best we can in an endeavour to try to ensure that wherever possible our specifications are similar to the kind of boat not only submarine which we can sell in international markets <e>", "<cs> my lords to a degree that is a separate question <e> <s> at the present time we have no intention of commissioning submarines abroad but i should not like that statement to be taken as meaning that we are not prepared to consider collaboration with other nautical powers within the alliance including holland in relation to shipbuilding programmes in the future we would and we do from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord neither does our service or any other expert adviser agree with him <e> <s> the soviet union are building modern conventional submarines and we see a continuing use for these in particular in shallow waters <e> <s> they have very considerable attributes including extreme quietness <e> <s> they are not regarded by military advisers in this country or in other countries as being obsolete <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the treasury is part of the government and therefore together with the department of industry was responsible for introducing the scheme <e> <s> the financial institutions the banks and others have certainly co-operated to the full and are co-operating in the necessary steps which we must take to monitor the scheme as it progresses <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that for new borrowing the interest rates have to be seen against the rate of inflation and with the guarantees involved here i do not believe that with the current interest rates which nobody wishes to see remain longer than is necessary there will be any major adverse effect on new borrowing for these purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that the noble lord is asking me the rate of interest on these schemes <e> <s> this depends entirely on the individual bank but the bank is aware that the lender has to pay a per cent <e> <s> premium for the guarantee which he the lender receives from the government to cover per cent <e> <s> of the loan if it were not despite everybodys hopes and beliefs to be repaid <e> <s> however the result of this that we can see so far is that the rates of interest in total including the per cent <e> <s> premium are not dissimilar from the current bank lending rates <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage no and one has to take account of all the steps which the government have taken to encourage small business the business start-up scheme the ability to set losses against tax the changes in general taxation <e> <s> but there are encouraging signs that the accumulation of these measures is producing an increase in small start-ups <e> <s> all the small modern factories that are built by both the eiec and local authorities continue to be taken up <e> <s> so while one cannot give a definitive answer there are signs that small business in this country is on the move <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his congratulations on the governments steps to encourage small business which i think are principally due to my old colleague in the department of industry the parliamentary under-secretary mr david mitchell who started much of the thinking behind these ideas <e> <s> so far as the overseas investment is concerned this is an age-old question and it has been examined on many occasions <e> <s> there is no correlation between the movements of overseas investments and the availability of investment for good home projects <e> <s> indeed the money is there if the projects can be found and encouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords i will let the noble lord know the detailed answer to that question <e> <s> i do not have it with me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord spens of course raises a key point and it is one of the reasons why the scheme will have to be monitored very carefully indeed <e> <s> i am absolutely clear that the banks are doing their very best to ensure that this is additional lending <e> <s> there is a difference between their judgment of what may be a viable project and the securities that a particular lender starting a new business can offer and in the past this has led to a refusal of loan on some occasions <e> <s> there is also the problem of the business without a track record but which has an apparently good idea <e> <s> considerable thought has gone into trying to ensure that this is additional lending <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is broadly yes <e> <s> the rates of interest that banks quote for different kinds of borrowing vary but the result is broadly the same rate of interest <e>", "<cs> my lords in the debates which followed the july defence review publication i mentioned that the standby squadron was at approxi <e>", "<cs> my lords the commission takes very seriously the need to operate efficiently the services it provides <e> <s> they are kept under regular review in order to ensure that any scope for improvements in efficiency is identified <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can assure my noble friend that the answer is satisfactory on each of those points <e> <s> the very considerable economies that have been effected have been made in the basic and old services of the manpower services commission while an expansion has taken place and has had to take place to deal with the special programmes and in particular the youth opportunities programme schemes which have been introduced <e> <s> her majestys government are going to spend as my noble friend said billion in trying to ensure that every school-leaver has a six months place of some kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have already answered on the question of money a very considerable sum in not entirely easy circumstances is being spent <e> <s> with regard to the youth opportunities programme being more orientated towards training needs i believe that within the practicalities of the situation that does take place with the one reservation that we have to be careful that we do not plan our training for jobs which we cannot see any reasonable prospect of developing <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement i have already made which was reiterated by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment in a broadcast last night included the quite clear assertion that the governments intentions remained to provide a six-month work or job opportunity for every school-leaver <e> <s> as to the general level of unemployment this is of course of the greatest concern to us all <e> <s> we note with some degree of hope that there now at last appears to be a pick-up in volume and a beginning of a recovery of this countrys industries share of world markets which has been sinking since <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the commission has been slow in consulting the trade union movement in every area as to training needs as well as consulting employers <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the schemes already announced and we are straying a bit from the centre of this question and particularly the youth opportunities programme go as far as funds can possibly allow down the lines that my noble friend suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend is aware of complaints of the kind the noble lord lord spens mentions <e> <s> we believe that these delays are exceptional but steps have been taken to try to reduce them to an absolute minimum <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that some notes on the unemployment figures have been included on this subject but i will certainly draw the suggestion to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i will draw that suggestion to the notice of my right honourable friend but i am fairly sure that we have looked at the situation caused by very severe unemployment in many countries <e> <s> we have looked at the steps other countries are taking to try to combat this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear that the noble lord lord jenkins the chairman of the cnd has indeed reprinted the full speech and has placed copies of it in the library <e> <s> i would recommend noble lords to read it <e> <s> if the house would bear with me for a moment or so on this very important matter i should like to point out that lord mountbatten as chief of defence staff fully supported <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the question of any inscription on any public statue that is a matter not only for the government but for the family of the statesman concerned and for many others <e> <s> however the suggestion as to the terms of the inscription and the request that the government support them are turned down for the reasons that i have stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i did not quite understand that but i have nothing to retract <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will read the full speech which shows all the late lord mountbattens horror of these weapons but that they will also concentrate on what he says when he gets to his practical propositions <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is undoubtedly true <e> <s> the noble lord knows well the date of the speech that lord mountbatten made not so very long before he was tragically assassinated <e> <s> it is a speech of a lifetime of reflections and a repugnance of war <e> <s> but the recommendations of what to do about it are entirely in accord with the present governments policies <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be more appropriate <e> <s> the question of any inscription is covered by one of my previous answers <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will check with his solicitor what is in his last words on this <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be in the interests of national security for me to comment on matters of this nature beyond saying that as part of our deterrent policy adequate emergency arrangements do of course exist <e>", "<cs> my lords i would repeat again that the governments policy is to prevent war all war and to do it through a policy of deterrence but the credibility of deterrence depends on certain emergency arrangements <e> <s> but i think it is quite wrong to suggest and i believe that perhaps this is the purpose of the noble lords question that because emergency arrangements are being made this in any way suggests the governments belief in the likelihood of a nuclear war <e> <s> we are determined to prevent all war and to do that we must have emergency arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords without agreeing with any precise estimate the absolute horror and severity of nuclear war is what makes us so determined to follow our policy of deterrence and behind that to work for the mutual reduction of arms about which i spoke in referring to lord mountbattens views in the last question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am going to give the same answer <e> <s> the whole point is not to have a war but the belief of her majestys government is that if our will to keep the balance were to be weakened by certain movements which are currently advocating a unilateral rather than a multilateral move in relation to disarmament war is more likely and not less likely <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins has now stated quite clearly that the government i think his words were and i will have to check <e>", "<cs> my lords balance appears in this world as it is to be necessary and a necessary preliminary to making slow progress towards disarmament and arms control <e>", "<cs> my lords i have answered the original question and said that we are not prepared to comment on this matter <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has got the wrong man <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not clear as to what decision the noble lord is referring <e> <s> the decision that nato has taken and both parliaments have discussed and have had plenty of opportunities to debate is the modernisation of the theatre nuclear forces and i will deal at this juncture with the point raised by the noble lord who has just intervened in relation to the arrangement in because i think he tended to suggest that it had only recently become a policy of the alliance that either we should go for equality of deployment of theatre weapons or even phase them out and reduce the sss <e> <s> it was made clear in by nato when they took the decision that they would have to modernise their theatre forces if the ussr who by then had been placing sss for two years were not prepared to stop and remove them <e> <s> the disarmament talks as part of the initiative were always an integral part of this decision <e>", "<cs> my lords in a democracy no government can continue if they take decisions which they cannot get ratified by parliament <e> <s> i will not give the noble lord a promise that we will not negotiate either in principle or in certain areas in military detail which will probably never be released until full and detailed explanations have been given in parliament <e> <s> but there is no risk here no flouting of parliamentary control <e> <s> governments have to measure the opinion of their parliaments and of their countries and they have to act <e> <s> they cannot discuss everything and every possible plan in parliament before moving it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to mind or not mind what my noble friend does and arranges with the business managers <e> <s> i should only like to add that there is no lack of sympathy for ex-prisoners of war particularly those who may be suffering from ill-health or conditions that may have developed from that and that my predecessors at the ministry of defence and elsewhere have examined all these questions with the greatest sympathy <e> <s> if my noble friend still wishes to pursue it that is his decision not mine <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think a completely definitive answer in the case of every ex-prisoner of war as to the exact justice of the situation years ago is possible <e> <s> i think all the evidence that exists contemporary evidence and all the memories that have been put together have been heard and examined <e> <s> it was for that reason that i said i could not see how a further inquiry could indeed do what the noble lord wishes it to do allay anxiety as to whether there may or may not have been individual cases of injustice years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the fresh evidence to which my noble friend is referring is evidence which he and his unofficial committee submitted to us at the end of which led finally to the meeting in may <e> <s> so that has been examined but i am in the hands of the house the noble earl and the business managers <e> <s> i understand the feeling on the subject i merely say as the minister who has come to this matter most recently and having read the detail of the background that i do not think there is any further way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only suggest that the noble lord reads the report of my honourable friend which was tabled on st october which goes into all of those questions and so far as is possible gives the answers <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that statement of opinion <e> <s> the economic circumstances have not entered into the governments decision on this question <e> <s> i do not think that i can add to my further replies in any other way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the detailed answer to that question <e> <s> i will let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend suggests that the figure of per cent <e> <s> which i have given could be applied to the period when the present administration came to office <e> <s> i do not think he is correct in that although i can tell him that the current figure for the third quarter of this year is an all time high in the economic history of this country <e> <s> it is an undoubted improvement <e> <s> as far as exports are concerned i will check my noble friends figure but certainly they stood up remarkably well through the most difficult period from the point of view of competitiveness and they are improving now <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept the noble lords explanation of the improvements <e> <s> the exchange rate has indeed fallen to a level which perhaps many people expected to be more compatible with our international competitiveness and certainly this has helped british industry in some respects <e> <s> there is no doubt that in addition to the exchange rate movement which has been helpful the much leaner fitter industry which has resulted from the last two years difficult period is also a major reason <e> <s> the output-per-man figures are at a record level and i hope this will mean that we can recover some of our lost share of world markets which fell from per cent <e> <s> in to per cent <e> <s> by <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why we have million people unemployed is not due to the actions in the later years of the labour government or indeed to the actions of this government <e> <s> it is for the reason that i have just mentioned namely that due to

friend lord cathcart has introduced this important debate in his characteristic way very constructively and in a way which can only help this house to make another important contribution to our national security <e> <s> the motion both separates and yet links what is called conventional defence on the one hand and nuclear weapons and deterrents on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords if the right reverend prelate would be so kind as to give way for one moment i should like to ask him which unilateral gestures of the soviet union in recent years he has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly did not use the words in turmoil <e> <s> i gave a lot of reasons as to how we are keeping it under control <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am glad that i am not on this occasion replying to a motion which covers both foreign affairs and defence although i would say to the noble lord lord gladwyn that it covers the problems affecting the whole of defence including nuclear weapons <e> <s> that is bad enough <e> <s> i will not go over the ground that i covered this afternoon with which a number of your lordships do not fully agree <e> <s> i will not therefore go into the question of trident and the extremely small percentage of the defence budget for which it accounts <e> <s> i would only say that my words clearly have not been accepted by the noble lord lord gladwyn but i hope that he will do me the credit of reading in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to delay your lordships at this hour <e> <s> the three reasons that i have mentioned and when the noble lord reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i

to famous experts or read what they say the one in contradiction to the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i really feel that with minutes on the clock i should not give way <e> <s> we do not believe that in a situation which if deterrence continues to work will never arise it necessarily follows that the first use of a nuclear weapon by defenders of freedom and democracy would automatically result in nuclear retaliation <e> <s> the aggressor would take stock from his bunkers as to whether his prize was attainable at an acceptable cost <e> <s> neither could he have any interest in acquiring a nuclear desert <e> <s> i therefore regard the term nuclear exchange as misleading <e> <s> there is no intention by her majestys government or by nato of nor any interest in fighting a limited nuclear war which no one can win <e> <s> our interest lies in keeping it clear in the potential aggressors mind that no aggression will pay <e> <s> we can certainly give the guarantee that if there is no aggression there will be no first use second use or any use of any nuclear weapon or any other weapon at all <e>", "<cs> my lords according to the register of companies the figure for the period

types of industries i know that they contain an important percentage of modern industries such as for example electronics but i shall write to the noble lord in relation to further splits <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been in this particular year a slight delay as regards the readiness of the figures but the general answer is that which i gave just now that it is extremely hard to get an exact register of small businesses without greatly increasing administration <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the agricultural aspect is a separate question so perhaps the noble lord would table it <e> <s> however the number of the governments measures to encourage for instance the regrettable number of people with redundancy payments to invest in new enterprises is very considerable and i believe that

from the question tabled by the noble lord <e> <s> however the noble lord has received answers on previous occasions certainly answers have been given in this house on previous occasions to the effect

our own stationed here and it will continue to be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree <e> <s> the suggestion of the original question is lack of unity in that alliance and i can assure the house that there is near to total unity in the alliance on all questions <e> <s> when the new administration in greece has taken stock we very much hope that it will come into line with all other members

of people read the record of these debates and these subjects are important <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right and i wish that the noble lord who asked this question and the noble lord lord brockway would draw attention to that fact more often <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much doubt whether either of those two propositions is the case within the warsaw pact <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing to add to the answer i gave to the noble lord just now <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said since we have sympathy in wanting to use range wherever possible we shall use it wherever we can but <e>", "<cs> my lords whether president reagans decision to use the term is entirely due to the efforts of the noble lord i do not know but as i have already said the government welcome using range wherever possible <e>", "<cs> my lords if i heard the noble lord correctly he asked me whether intermediate and inter-regional are the same thing <e> <s> without a definition of what the noble lord means by inter-regional perhaps he would write to me on it i hesitate to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks me intermediate between what and what <e> <s> between intercontinental strategic missiles on the one hand and short-range tactical use missiles on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with my noble friend a balance at the lowest level that we can achieve through the current disarmament initiatives <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is covering different ground from that covered in the original question <e> <s> i would merely say once again that the purpose of retaining all these very powerful hideously powerful weapons is to deter an aggressor who clearly at the moment shows no sign of dropping his aggressive habits <e>", "<cs> my lords as was said in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the original funding decision was taken in by the last administration and the estimate at that time was million in prices <e> <s> the administration previous to the last administration that is the heath government had taken a decision in principle to pursue the chevaline route but the main funding decisions were taken by the labour administration <e> <s> if there be any doubt about all-party belief in the development of chevaline noble lords will have noted that leading members of the sdp on a recent programme on television were clearly party to the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington has raised two questions <e> <s> the vast majority of defence contracts if they are not competitive contracts are controlled closely and within a very small percentage of certain targets which have been agreed by successive administrations <e> <s> so far as the chevaline contract is concerned i believe that the major part of this is a non-competitive contract but it is very closely regulated in accordance with the procedures for ensuring that undue profits are not made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am af <e>", "<cs> my lords the point which the noble lord raises has of course been examined in great detail and continues to be examined <e> <s> i would only say to the noble lord at this stage that the planning for trident extends to the maintenance of an independent deterrent well into the next century and different considerations apply to the considerations which will make it necessary for some degree of polaris remotoring to take place in this decade <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord lord brockway that this question is a gamble <e> <s> it is quite clear from all current opinion polls that the public do not think so either <e> <s> so far as the outcome of geneva is concerned should in the future any disarmament talks affect our own nuclear weapons there will be no hesitation

that any future government and we have aspirations in that respect will have to pay attention to the facts of the situation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have decided to replace polaris in the s with trident <e> <s> there is now the question which the government have been studying which stems from the united states decision to move from the c trident missile to the d <e> <s> the governments decision on that matter is not yet ready but will he announced as soon as it is reasonably possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are getting into different questions <e> <s> i have debated public opinion polls with the noble lord before and will do so again <e>", "<cs> my lords that too is an entirely separate question <e> <s> we shall conduct our affairs in the way that this democratic government have always done in matters of supreme importance such as defence <e>", "<cs> my lords and refunded <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with care to this debate and i know that my noble friend who has asked this question is himself still deeply concerned about this matter <e> <s> listening to the debate i can only echo the words of lord mayhew if i may that to some extent it has been a debate in the dark <e> <s> if i may say so to the noble lord lord mackie i did in fact explore whether standing orders would allow me to speak after the noble earl so that members taking part in the debate could first hear the governments views on this vexed and difficult subject <e> <s> the standing orders do not allow that <e>", "<cs> my lords i will come to that point a little later on <e> <s> the noble earls unofficial committee have made the point that the exchange rates used for the calculations and the final reconciliation in sterling were unfortunate for them <e> <s> they have also made the point and clearly it was made at the time that camp money could buy little and was of little value <e> <s> all i can say is that it is clear that both those subjects were fully debated at the time and the exchange rates used in calculating both the deductions and the refunds which were the same in both cases were in my view <e>", "<cs> my lords i will consider the noble lords request <e> <s> the summary that i am given is drawn from a very large number of documents <e>", "<cs> my lords as i mentioned earlier i have in fact asked for a significant cross-section of those letters and i have read them <e> <s> i have to tell my noble friend that the majority and without looking at every one i cannot tell whether it is a very large majority but i fancy it is certainly on my sample of those letters merely say that as a result of an article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures of increase in output in the third quarter were some per cent <e> <s> up on the previous level and there has been an increase since that time <e> <s> as i mentioned before christmas in an answer to another question this modest increase in output has meant a very significant increase some per cent <e> <s> from the low point in productivity or output per man <e> <s> these increases both in output and in productivity are ahead of our main industrial competitors <e> <s> i am afraid that i did not quite hear the last part of my noble friends supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords the chemical industry has had a share of the increase and the engineering industry has also had a share of the increase with particularly good export orders <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is an increase in confidence in the future and an increase in confidence that the policies of this government will lead to a real improvement in our competitive position <e>", "<cs> my lords after a loss of half british industrys share of world markets since confidence was low <e> <s> the result of this loss of share of markets due to lack of competitiveness showed up only when world growth stopped <e> <s> but confidence from that accumulated low accumulated under governments of both parties over a long period is now being dispersed <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> indeed during the most difficult periods the maintenance of very low margins on our export position showed the determination of british industry and with a more competitive position now those who stuck to the export markets are receiving their rewards <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that small business confidence is improving <e> <s> interest rates will be kept no higher than is necessary in the continuing battle against inflation <e> <s> on the unemployment figures i do not think that anyone expected the peak to have yet been reached but unemployment trends follow economic trends and the rate of increase of unemployment is already substantially lower than it was this time last year <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said the reason for the lowering of manufacturing output prior to this rise was based on the loss of world market share from nearly per cent <e> <s> in to per cent <e> <s> in the late s <e> <s> this showed up only when world growth of the most spectacular level came <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will table a question on which particular industries he has in mind i am sure we will answer it <e> <s> the confidence is rising but i do not want to give an impression that we believe there is going to be a very fast rise in economic activity <e> <s> with the winter we have just had there is bound to be a small change <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree that the united kingdom government have surrendered control and i shall not repeat my first answer <e> <s> we have complete confidence in the working of the nato alliance now and in times of emergency or stress <e> <s> i think that the people of this country are very grateful or should be very grateful for the deployment of american missiles to take the place of ageing bombers in exactly the same way as the bombers have operated for the last years <e> <s> the deterrent power of our alliance has kept the peace <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the vast majority of the noble lords sentiments and i am sure that the house does too <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord will know that the dual key arrangements for some weapons on the continent relate to those weapons that are jointly paid for between allies where one ally provides one part of the weapon and has the key and another ally provides another part <e> <s> in the case of these missiles the united states are supplying the whole missile and the warhead just as they did for their bombers before them and are paying the entire bill <e> <s> we are entirely satisfied that dual key is not applicable in those circumstances but that the joint decision arrangements are entirely reliable particularly since these bases lie within the united kingdom so that even those who may wish to conjecture about a very reliable ally perhaps going mad at some future date should recognise that we have the full power to ensure that our agreement is carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole purpose of the alliance and all the arrangements is to ensure that the bombs do not fly and i am absolutely convinced that they will be successful <e> <s> matters such as very fast communications and steps to be taken in an emergency have to be worked out so that deterrence shall be credible <e> <s> they have been worked out but it is not in the public interest for me to disclose the details of them <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords for all the reasons that i have stated i do not agree with either proposition and i think that the government and most of the house agree that our total security depends upon a close working alliance and confidence between the partners <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord who asked the question has heard the comments of my noble friend and will press the ussr on this kind of point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has previously had an answer to the question of dual key i think last week <e> <s> i have nothing further to add to it and we are entirely satisfied with the control arrangements based on our joint decision agreement <e> <s> so far as the united states are concerned i too soldiered alongside them in the last war which they fought in europe for our defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for producing those figures which i can confirm <e> <s> indeed i think that in the free democracies it is sometimes a pastime to criticise ourselves and our allies particularly our strongest ally <e> <s> i believe that we all have a responsibility in the free world to help the public keep in perspective criticisms of our fellow members of our defensive free alliance <e> <s> my worry is that questions of this nature might have the opposite effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i so much agree with the noble lord on that point <e> <s> the timing of a particular opinion poll the order of the questions the type of the questions and i have looked at all of them in some detail can very much affect the answers <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in agreement with the noble viscount <e> <s> i think we should be extremely grateful to the united states for paying for and stationing their nuclear weapons in europe to ensure that we have an adequate deterrent to deter the warsaw pact alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord and i do agree with the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> the british public are entirely sound in the main areas <e> <s> they agree with keeping up defence expenditure with nato and even contrary to the noble lords wishes no doubt with keeping our own independent deterrent <e> <s> if the british public had all the details of the real choices before them as to how one keeps up a deterrent in the alliance i have no doubt about the soundness of their response <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is in error <e> <s> at the moment we have outdated united states bombers as we have rather ageing british bombers capable of delivering the nuclear deterrent <e> <s> the plan to which the noble lord alludes is the plan to modernise the necessary deterrent at an intermediate range <e> <s> the fact that that modernisation plan is tied to disarmament talks the noble lords knows well and is another subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord took part in the debate on the unstarred question and i spoke for minutes i regret to say in reply to that debate <e> <s> i believe that all of the points that he has raised were fully answered in that unstarred question and i really have nothing further to add <e> <s> for the benefit of the house in general let me say that i made clear in my answer that deductions were made according to a policy which was known throughout the war <e> <s> refunds were considerable and widespread <e> <s> some credits did <e>", "<cs> my lords i did refer to a number of documents and a number of letters and referred noble lords attention particularly to the reports of the public accounts committee and the comptroller and auditor general at the end of the period during which all these questions under two administrations were considered <e> <s> i am seeing my noble friend lord kimberley who raised the unstarred question and some of the members of his unofficial committee tomorrow as i promised i would do <e> <s> dependent upon that meeting it may seem helpful if we give fuller answers to the many points which he has raised and which they have raised in documents that they have sent to us <e> <s> the documents are not complete <e> <s> the two governments of the time clearly considered all these matters <e> <s> there are no individual records left and there is no conceivable way of telling individual entitlements today <e> <s> as i said during the debate on the unstarred question i do not regard it as a service to anyone concerned

unstarred question have found a great many more references in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord also took part on the unstarred question although he was unable to stay until the end of the debate <e> <s> but i did answer all the points that he has raised on that occasion and on a short starred question to elaborate further is extremely difficult <e> <s> there was no instruction from the treasury and i said that i think twice in my speech in the debate <e> <s> there was considerable correspondence <e> <s> only part of which has been preserved and i mentioned a number of ministers who had been involved in parts of the correspondence <e> <s> i also mentioned an interdepartmental committee and i drew the noble lords attention i do not know whether he has read them to the comptroller and auditor generals report and to the public accounts committees report <e> <s> i think that on a starred question i cannot go further <e>", "<cs> my lords in the unstarred question debate the noble lord did indeed ask me that question <e> <s> i undertook to consider the degree to which the publication in the library of further documents or drawing the attention of the house to further documents in a situation of incomplete documents though very considerable documents would be helpful <e> <s> i promised to come back to him <e>", "<cs> my lords we would all like a cheaper alternative system <e> <s> having taken part in and heard about the search for an alternative system which would be an effective independent deterrent into the next century i can only tell the noble lord that i do not believe that one has yet been suggested whether by mr <e> <s> speed or by anyone else <e> <s> so far as the popular support for britains independent deterrent is concerned i would hate to return to the question we discussed last week but on that subject even the questions as asked in the opinion polls show very clearly that the majority of the public are in favour of the maintenance of an independent deterrent <e> <s> i believe any government faced with the facts with which this government are faced would come to the same conclusion as we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that suggestion <e> <s> i think the probability is that the governments decision on which form of trident which is under review at the moment will probably be announced before the white paper is published and it will then be for the house to consider whether it wants to debate that question rather than the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords this question has been debated many times in this house <e> <s> the noble lord may have been present <e> <s> in summary i would merely say that the maintenance of britains independent deterrent is welcomed by all members of the alliance and is regarded as an extra and important deterrent to any possible russian aggression which might take place under the misapprehension that the united states could be decoupled from europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with that <e> <s> i believe it is a most important and effective part of the total deterrence against aggression <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes an error <e> <s> it obviously can be proceeded with not at the cost of all our conventional weapons <e> <s> the noble lord also knows that the percentage of our defence budget estimated for our deterrent over a long period of time is of the order of per cent <e> <s> to that extent it is a competitor with other means of defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i think all of us are against weapons war and particularly nuclear weapons <e> <s> the question as the noble lord knows well is the practical way forward in the world in which we live where aggression is clearly a constant danger <e>", "<cs> my lords where there is an advantage in being independent and we do rely on the alliance today in many areas where we have the means and the know-how and we know about submarines and about the manufacture of important parts of these terrible weapons i agree entirely with the noble lord that in those areas we should stay independent <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends memory on the latter point will undoubtedly be better than mine <e> <s> but certainly governments of both parties when in power and when faced with the problem have maintained our independent deterrent <e> <s> i think that sometimes the house underestimates the sometimes terrifying speed of technological change and the rate of obsolescence and therefore is inclined to believe that there is another easy alternative <e> <s> there is not <e> <s> as regards the first part of my noble friends question the answer is that trident is absolutely essential for the independent deterrent certainly in this century and probably into the next century <e>", "<cs> my lords the only way to reply to the noble lord in a short answer is to repeat that we are talking about per cent <e> <s> of our defence budget and our defence budget has been increased by this administration and we have to consider what the defence budget should be in all circumstances <e> <s> we regard this as being one of the best value parts of the deterrent <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state has posed the question which do you think the russians would rather see us have a few extra tanks and i quantify that as a division and a half with supporting weapons in this area or a maintenance of the independent deterrent <e> <s> i believe that to ask the question provides the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering this question i shall go no further than to say what the government have stated over and over again namely that over the period into the s before trident <e>", "<cs> of the defence budget over that period <e> <s> and i have pointed out that it is substantially less than the total cost of the tornado weapon system <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i hope that he will read my answer to his question in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that any calculation is extremely difficult <e> <s> one just does not know what sort of war one would be facing but i have given figures which indicate that the cost of war in terms of money must be at least times the cost of our per cent <e> <s> of gdp spent on defence at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen the report to which the noble lord refers and the fact that the results of the average of post-costed contracts during the period under review were per cent <e> <s> above the target on average and that that produces a result of to per cent <e> <s> return on capital in inflation-proof terms in real terms <e> <s> the system is designed to encourage firms which are efficient to exceed the target <e> <s> the firms which are post-costed are those where we believe there is a purpose in post-costing <e> <s> thus the government on the whole are content that this last report shows an average which is healthy and which is required certainly if industry is to take over a greater degree of its own development currently performed for it <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to british manufacturing industries profit levels the defence industry is as the noble lord lord mayhew <e> <s> implied slightly better off but the return on capital is not commensurate with that being earned by industry in competitor countries <e> <s> the government would like to see it rise through efficiency so that more competitive levels of research and development can be commercially funded <e>", "<cs> my lords the only country which is a member of nato and whose armed forces are equipped with such weapons is the united states which has a limited and aging national capability <e>", "<cs> my lords i have of course seen president reagans statements on this matter and i can confirm that our belief is that the ussr has a stock of these weapons much of it deployed in forward stores of over tonnes and that by any estimation it has well over times the amount of the usa <e> <s> president reagan has taken the decision that under those circumstances he has to restart developments in certain areas and possibly production but no decisions about deployment have been taken and if they were to be taken the allies would be consulted <e> <s> so far as arms control is concerned i share the noble lords hope and i do not believe it will be for want of trying by nato and the united states if no agreements in this area as well as other vitally important areas are reached <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say the whole tonnes and we believe the stocks to exceed that was in forward areas but a good part of it is deployed forward <e> <s> as to answering the noble lords question about how information of that kind is derived i do not think it would be in the national interest to do so but we are entirely clear that the statement i made is not an over-statement <e>", "<cs> i am not briefed on that particular topic my lords and i will write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no evidence of the possession of biological weapons by the soviet union the production of which was banned under the treaty <e> <s> there are worrying reports in relation to the possible use of micro-toxins in south-east asia which are being investigated and we are helping at porton down in the analysis of certain substances <e> <s> so far as deterrents are concerned i do not think i would fully agree with my noble friend and i never have that we must have an exact balance of everything we must have an adequate degree of deterrence so that any aggressor will face an unacceptable cost if he were to start an aggression <e>", "<cs> i must totally contradict the implication of the first part of that supplementary my lords i am entirely in line with government policy in this area which has been stated time and again and i certainly will not give the noble lord any assurance in an uncertain future on exactly what we should do in any particular arm <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for drawing my attention to that article my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i would rather not go further than i already have <e> <s> the size and deployment of the stocks i think tell their own story <e> <s> whether one calls chemical warfare conventional or not i find hard to say and in many respects i find it as unpleasant as any nuclear weapon <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a separate question which perhaps the noble lord lord jenkins or the noble lord lord molloy would be happy to table <e>", "<cs> my lords that too is a moderately separate question <e> <s> but in fact as i told the noble lord before since we lost well over half our market share between and his assertion is not correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is yes there are problems for the reasons i gave in my answer to the noble lord lord jenkins but there are also start-ups <e> <s> the many schemes operated by my right honourable friends department aimed at encouraging new technology and small businesses are available in this area which is geographically well located and start-ups and improvements are taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said the reason for the current situation is indeed the recession <e> <s> the period under the previous administration not the end of it was one in which the growth of the free world had nearly doubled in the years that i have spoken of <e> <s> we lost half our share and stood still <e> <s> when that growth came to an end recession was inevitable <e>", "<cs> my lords the increase of rates and of costs of public sector

to prevent that pressure from continuing to increase <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may deal with the points raised by the noble lord the leader of the opposition and the noble lord lord mayhew i believe that there has been a great deal of consultation with the territorial army on what it was thought should be done <e> <s> the government have now come to decisions and there will be further consultation on the implementation <e> <s> i believe that that is the normal procedure <e> <s> i did not entirely follow i may have to write to him the noble lord the leader of the opposition in his

as far as concerns the adventure courses for young people between and social security will continue to be paid <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all i will say in the time available to discuss a statement is that as a percentage of the army budget which does not completely include all the things that the territorial army use because it is hard to separate the costs of some of them it is at the moment of the order of per <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a new scheme and we must see how it goes but the plan is to give - to -week courses to a total of young people between april and october of this year using the spare capacity in the establishments which we have over that period <e>", "<cs> my lords i will write to my noble friend and to the noble lord the leader of the opposition because i think this is an overlapping point <e> <s> it is not affected by these new measures but i will find out the exact position and let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> my lords the need for improved reconnaissance in relation to the yeomanry regiments <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give my noble friend much detail <e> <s> this is a reorganisation which is part of a re-roling affecting both the regular army and the territorial army <e> <s> the division which is assigned to the reinforcement of baor will in future have a regiments worth that is the equivalent of a battalion strength or a regiment strength of logistic support <e> <s> this will include transport ordnance ambulances and so on <e> <s> this regiment will be based on territorial army logistic units which are based at the moment in scotland i cannot say where they are but i can let my noble friend know and also in the north of england <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment it is not planned to issue a white paper <e> <s> the statement will be studied in considerable detail <e> <s> in the case of the youth scheme which is not the immediate concern that the noble lord has just mentioned there will be considerable further detail released <e> <s> i would take this opportunity to say that young people should not volunteer for this scheme until after the end of this month by which time application forms and details will have been circulated and local recruitment depts will have been briefed <e> <s> but in relation to the territorial army no doubt there will be more discussion in parliament and undoubtedly individual announcements in the localities concerned <e> <s> i can give the noble lord a little more information and certainly it will come out bit by bit <e>", "<cs> my lords when i answered the noble lord lord mayhew i compared these weapons as the noble lord has just done to nuclear weapons <e> <s> i also mentioned that the soviet stocks were well in excess of tonnes of modern weapons mainly stored forward against an out-of-date aging stock of tonnes in america which is the only stock that they have <e> <s> against that situation i hope the noble lord instead of pressing this house will press for the cessation of production of chemical weapons in the uusr and for the destruction of their stocks <e> <s> we have the guarantee on consultation of which the noble lord speaks and which i also announced on th february and so far as the various united nations or other forums are concerned we shall lose no opportunity to support practical disarmament moves <e>", "<cs> my lords i would draw the attention of the noble lord the leader of the opposition to my answer on th february i have the feeling that the noble lord was in the house but i may be wrong that the united states has in fact confirmed that it intends against the balance that i have mentioned to start certain developments and particularly they involve ordering long-lead items <e> <s> that is all <e> <s> no decisions have been taken on deployment of any kind and before they are taken consultation has been promised <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed that thinking that has driven our american allies to the very modest step of ordering certain long-lead items as a back-up for efforts at discussions as regards which we wish them well <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed taking part in an investigation in relation to the use of chemical weapons in the far east <e> <s> i promised the noble lord lord avebury at least i think i did an answer in relation to ethiopia which i have not yet sent him but which i have called for and will send him <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as lethality is concerned in a hypothetical situation where no decisions have begun to be taken about deployment of weapons of a power which i do not think we have yet understood i am referring to modern chemical weapons i cannot answer the noble lords question <e> <s> so far as the second part of the noble lords question is concerned i would say once again that her majestys government are entirely satisfied that the american assurance on consultation before any deployment assuming that by then no progress has been made on disarmament will be entirely satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume that the noble baroness is referring to a transcript of the panorama programme <e> <s> i find that there is plenty of speculation in the media of every kind on every defence subject <e> <s> i am finding that the vast majority of it has very little correlation with the facts <e>", "<cs> my lords lord mayhews definition of an arms race or a race at all is i think different from mine <e> <s> if your opponent is within yards of the finishing post and you order a pair of running shoes and tell him that if he does not stop you are going to start chasing him then i suppose that you can call it a race <e> <s> that is the situation <e> <s> as far as an initiation of disarmament talks is concerned i am quite sure that my noble friend loses no opportunity whatever to initiate them <e> <s> but as i have said so often in this place i believe that most worthwhile initiations are not widely announced in advance <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the leader of the opposition and the noble lord lord mayhew for keeping their comments brief on such a very important subject <e> <s> i am sure that we shall discuss it in the future <e> <s> the noble lord lord mayhew asserted that if a future government were made up of other parties they would not be in favour of this and would cancel it <e> <s> since my right honourable friend was in balk so to speak for quite some while before the americans made their decision on their nuclear deterrent and we were thus able to have discussions with them and make our own decisions i hope that members opposite and their parties will not make up their mind until they have looked at the facts <e> <s> i believe that some reactions are tantamount to saying ive made up my mind dont confuse me with the facts <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kennet suggests that this is a product which we do not need <e> <s> i do not think a single suggestion has been made by his party which includes in its leadership a number of those who have taken part in the independent deterrent decisions of the past that we do not need a deterrent which is capable in the opinion of all the experts of producing the same degree of deterrent power as we have had in the past <e> <s> in suggesting that all we need is a minimum deterrent the noble lord and many others outside the house are i believe guilty of wishful thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the first part of my noble friends remarks as i have already made clear <e> <s> with regard to expenditure by the french on their independent nuclear deterrent the estimate we have is that they spend on their independent nuclear deterrent some per cent <e> <s> out of their total budget <e> <s> with regard to jobs we do not have a precise estimate <e> <s> the vickers barrow line will continue into trident submarine production following ssn production <e> <s> there will be new capital equipment required and therefore an increase in jobs at the vickers yard <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord noel-baker asks about the number of nuclear warheads <e> <s> the statement makes it clear that we plan on current intentions to have the same number of warheads as we would have had on the c system <e> <s> we do not disclose the details of the size of the warhead although i believe there is no major difference <e> <s> as regards the escalating arms race as the noble lord mentioned it the united kingdom has maintained its deterrent in a world in which modernisation requires change and is not escalating <e> <s> the soviet union has in all areas escalated very fast in recent years and that countrys total defence spending has increased very greatly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord suggests as he has done many times before that the possession of this kind of independent deterrent by us is useless <e> <s> yet many noble lords have pointed to what they regard as the excess levels of nuclear weapons in the worlds armoury as a whole <e> <s> one cannot have it both ways <e> <s> the deterrent we have had in the past and the deterrent we mean to maintain is sufficient on its own to cause quite unacceptable damage to any aggressor <e> <s> it is the key characteristic of an independent deterrent that it should have that power on its own and it does have that power on its own <e> <s> provided that it does it will never be used because in fact this country will never be attacked in the way that will require that response <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and gallant lord for those questions and his final comment <e> <s> i agree with the noble and gallant lord that the position is not understood in the country <e> <s> i have found travelling up and down myself that there is just no comprehension of the fact that the trident cost has little or nothing to do at the present time with the problems of paying for modern weapons in the conventional area <e> <s> the critics are chasing the wrong fox and they are a fairly motley pack <e> <s> i can assure the noble and gallant lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am corrected by the noble lord and my old friend if i may say so <e> <s> i was referring to the critics up and down the country and not to noble lords opposite <e> <s> i think if the noble lord looks at <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question on this subject about which he has asked other questions related to the start date and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i have on previous occasions given quite a lot of reasons why we think that an inquiry now could not elicit what happened to individuals at that time <e> <s> it is for that reason of not wishing to raise false expectations that the government continue to maintain that there is no point but many disadvantages in an inquiry <e> <s> i am waiting to hear from my noble friend as chairman of his un-official committee the results of further detailed discussions between one of his members and my officials and i can only say that i hope very much that we shall have satisfied him <e> <s> i know that representations continue <e> <s> it is a very long time ago and it is extremely hard at this stage to know what actually happened when the noble lord who asked this question himself said that when he returned to this country he put his italian pay book into cox and kings <e> <s> but we have found that the orderly room sergeants of the units which they rejoined cox and kings and lloyds and in every pay account we have found did carry out the policy of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i dealt with my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords opinion is that this is a problem which will not go away <e> <s> i can only say that i have heard from a number of ex-prisoners who were worried as a result of the media coverage of this subject that they may have missed money which was their due and who having read the debate that took place in this house do at least now say that they have no accurate recollection and it may well be that their accounts were credited <e> <s> the noble lord says that at least one-third were not credited <e> <s> if he will read the letter that i have had placed in the library dated nd february and the document attached to it i believe he will be quite unable to hold to that point of view <e> <s> i would ask him to read the letter <e>", "<cs> my lords at the official rates of exchange the sums are now very close together <e> <s> over the past years the line of the warsaw pact in absolute terms has increased and the line of nato has been more down than the likely increase which is now going to take place in the next year or two <e> <s> the sums on official exchange rates are about level <e> <s> the official exchange rate is not a very meaningful figure and part of the reasons for that are that there is a completely different structure and standard of living within the soviet union <e> <s> the more impressive comparisons are the actual hardware which those amounts of money buy which include figures such as for the warsaw pact tanks and for nato tanks <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> across a whole range of important armaments particularly potentially offensive armaments the balance is heavily against nato <e>", "<cs> my lords the reasons are the quite different costs within the soviet union of hardware and manpower <e> <s> the very much cheaper cost to them in terms of manpower shows up in the greatest superiority in the areas of tanks and artillery pieces for instance <e> <s> but the superiorities show up right through and that of course is because of the different standards of living in the west and in the soviet union <e> <s> i have recently drawn attention to the fantastic differences in balance in chemicals and of course in intermediate-range missiles which are well known <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount mentions other reasons why money comparisons are not in fact the really meaningful areas and i entirely agree with that <e> <s> since he mentioned health and education it is worth repeating that we in the west spend a very much bigger percentage on health and education in various ways than do the warsaw pact countries <e>", "<cs> my lords in terms of the hardware that it buys i entirely agree with the noble lord but the actual billions of roubles at the official exchange rate are very close to the billions of dollars that the west spends <e> <s> however in the meaningful terms of the comparison of armaments what the noble lord said is quite right and a per cent <e> <s> expenditure does not begin to get us on a par <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord takes the question right on to the area of disarmament which has been discussed many times before <e> <s> i do not think that in this house i have ever attributed the idea that anyone wants war and i think it is a much wider question and one that should be debated on a separate occasion as to whether or not the soviet union is playing a waiting game <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly true <e> <s> we have adequate deterrence <e> <s> if potential aggressors ever got to the stage of doubting our will or the adequacy of our deterrent power then there would he a severe risk of their not waiting <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is another question <e> <s> the question refers to the comparison of expenditure on armaments and i believe we have done that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the theoretical answer would have much bearing on the actual balance of armaments which we already know <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are giving all support to practical methods of disarmament <e> <s> i have covered the question of comparability in real and practical terms perhaps over-thoroughly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am going to comment on that point at a later stage <e> <s> at this stage i will return for a second to the requirements of the queens flight as such <e> <s> the requirements are for short journeys and for long journeys at home and abroad and for landing on big airfields and small airfields <e> <s> in that context the aeroplanes that her majesty and the royal family can draw on at the moment are not too bad a range for doing all those things <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend knows very well whether it is looked at as a capital sum or as a lease it is a financial burden and a financial burden at this stage <e> <s> as far as his statement and assertion that his figure is nearer than mine is concerned i can only say that this has been examined by all the experts concerned and the figure that i have given which was not million but well in excess of million i believe to be the accurate figure <e>", "<cs> my lords in a study which took place in or <e> <s> that is my recollection of that particular figure which i noted in preparing myself to answer this unstarred question <e> <s> it is not just the costs of the aircraft it is the cost of the necessary equipment to maintain them in the kind of permanent readiness the degree of spares and of back-up that needs to be provided <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended to do that when i came to that question <e> <s> the remark that i made before the noble lord intervened prompts me to say that we and indeed the whole country are going to have to use a good deal of patience bearing in mind the time that is taken both to carry out diplomatic negotiations and to traverse miles of sea <e> <s> the support of my noble friend lord home of the hirsel is very welcome and his observation about this not being the appropriate moment for post-mortems is also helpful <e> <s> nevertheless i regret that some noble lords including the noble lord lord byers after a helpful contribution could not resist the opportunity to make some political points even about our independent nuclear deterrent which as my noble friend lord home has said is aimed against a quite different threat <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord raised a totally irrelevant point and i think that my noble friend lord home has more than adequately illustrated that <e> <s> but let me just add that since this administration came to power we have done more to increase real defence of a conventional kind than any administration for a very long time <e> <s> the share of the defence budget spent on conventional naval forces has increased substantially since we came <e>", "<cs> my lords the media frequently speculate on what to those without responsibility may seem obvious <e> <s> sometimes they are right sometimes they are wrong <e> <s> the noble lords lord byers and lord mayhew questioned the standards of our intelligence and indeed my noble friend lord caldecote questioned whether we should not have known a great deal more a great deal earlier <e> <s> the argentines perform regular naval exercises on a very big scale at about this time of the year and all the activities that were observed were consistent with their being for the purpose of exercises <e> <s> here i would thank my noble friend lord buxton who openly and correctly stated and no one is in closer contact with the area than he is that no one knew <e>", "<cs> my lords for all the reasons that the noble lord himself implied in his initial speech i do not feel that i can say anything <e> <s> let me answer the question asked by the noble lord lord wigg <e> <s> the information we have at this stage information which comes from the governor is that the marines did engage but suffered no casualties <e> <s> there were some argentine casualties <e>", "<cs> my lords my appeal was to the media <e> <s> perhaps i should not make that appeal in this house but i make it quite sincerely for all the reasons that i and other noble lords have given today <e> <s> i believe that this is a time for national unity and for concentrating on the present situation <e> <s> the vast majority want to give all the backing that we can to my noble friend and my right honourable friend and i end my reply with a repetition of my noble friends words this morning it is our firm objective to ensure that the falklands are freed from alien occupation <e> <s> my lords i commend the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords we wish to move that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the latter part of the noble lords supplementary question does not flow from the question that he asked but there is no question but that nuclear weapons are not applicable to the current situation in the falkland islands area <e> <s> in relation to all other statements made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state so far as i am aware they are in accord with my answer to the noble lords question stating the policy of deterrence <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the whole area of defence strategy has always been an area in which experts question other experts <e> <s> the majority of opinions which successive governments have accepted are in line with those which this government and nato as a whole accept fully <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the reflection of recent peace movement ventures which now is apparent in the united states <e> <s> i am certainly not aware that members of congress support what he has claimed <e> <s> the whole congress so far as i am aware fully supports the policy and continuation of nato and its deterrent strategy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords supplementary question assumes that nato and the warsaw pact are in the same position and looking at it from opposite angles <e> <s> nato is a defensive pact of free democratic countries while the ussr and the warsaw pact countries consist of totalitarian rgimes that recently again have proved their preparedness to use military force for aggressive purposes <e> <s> nato needs a range of options to make clear as necessary that no aggressor can get away with it <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the increase in the use of the scheme has been very considerable and that led my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer to increase for the second time the funds allotted to this scheme <e> <s> he announced at the time of the budget that million would be allocated in the current year and million next year <e> <s> so far as the rates are concerned the clearing banks normally charge most of their small business customers between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> above the base rate for lending <e> <s> under the loan guarantee scheme they seem to be charging between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> above base rate <e> <s> that is why in answer to a previous question from my noble friend i said that the net cost to the borrower was about the same <e> <s> in relation to my noble friends third supplementary point as to whether we would consider any change in the premium charge it is much too early to say and the main object of the scheme is to cover risk loans that would not otherwise take place rather than to produce cheap lending <e>", "<cs> my lords the current review will of course take in the current individual ceiling which the noble lord mentions but i do not think <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has on a previous occasion asked me the same question and i can only give him the same answer the banks and financial institutions are taking every step to try to ensure that this is additional lending <e> <s> this is one of the important aspects of the present review being carried out by my honourable friend mr john macgregor at the department of industry <e> <s> it is one of the points he will be particularly looking at <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said to the noble lord so often the effects of our cumulative non-competitiveness are still with us and it will take some time yet in this country to overcome the very poor rate of new business start-ups and of small business growth compared with other countries over the last to years but the difference is beginning to be made good by the current administrations schemes including this one <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a well-established procedure for identifying civil and military installations with a vital role in maintaining the economy and the defence of the country in both peace and war <e> <s> the procedure provides for full consultation with all interested parties <e> <s> appropriate security precautions are undertaken to ensure the protection of such installations against hostile attack but it would not be in the national interest to give further details <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can assure my noble friend that this is a subject of great importance is understood as being of great importance and that more than one government department as well as the forces the police and the local authorities play an important part in it <e> <s> i think i can also assure my noble friend that we review the situation in all the areas concerned to ensure that it is up-to-date and to ensure that emergency plans are made particularly in the frightening and uncertain world in which we live today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i omitted to mention the gunners <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have recently announced the formation of the home service force which my right honourable friend the secretary of state announced in relation to his statement in march on the territorials and the reserves <e> <s> that certainly is one of the bits of evidence to show that the situation is kept under constant review as was the extension of the royal marines with the comacchio company a few years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords that is largely a separate question which the government also keep under review <e> <s> their security arrangements are constantly discussed with their allies <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the noble lords supplementary <e> <s> the importance of this subject is immense <e> <s> however i hope he will accept that part of my answer which the noble lord the leader of the opposition reinforced namely that it is extremely difficult to answer the question as put in terms of the actual steps that we are taking <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already mentioned that in announcing a major increase in the reserves of the territorials my right honourable friend the secretary of state also announced the formation of the new home service force with this specific object in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly look at any evidence that any individual officer ex-prisoner wishes to submit to us <e> <s> we have done so in a great number of cases but such are feelings on this subject that i feel it is only right and proper that officers who suffered captivity should have any opportunity that they can to develop their individual feelings and figures <e> <s> i quite accept that the old lags as the noble lord calls himself are a sceptical lot and i also <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noted that the noble earls unofficial committee i do not think he is here today have moved their emphasis from the carrying out of policy to the question of policy and to the question of whether the benevolent funds could be augmented <e> <s> i have asked the noble earl with most of the noble lords in this house who have expressed an interest in this matter to come and look at the question of the policy which we now seem to be talking about next week at the ministry of defence <e> <s> i should like to be guided by that meeting and by their views after that meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that supplementary question <e> <s> the answer is that neither i nor two other ministers who have looked at this nor my officials have had any case made out and substantiated to demonstrate that the policy which i have described very often in this house was not carried out <e> <s> therefore the answer is that no cases have been made out and indeed one member of the noble earls committee captain bracken who put forward what he made clear was an illustrative claim has agreed with my officials that that claim cannot be substantiated <e> <s> so at this time no evidence of maladministration is available <e> <s> it now remains to discuss the question of policy of those long years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the particular case to which the noble and learned lord refers but i will certainly research it <e> <s> however in this case i can assure him that no evidence has been established in any individual case which shows that the policy was not carried out <e> <s> i should like to make <e>", "<cs> my lords at the last meeting of natos nuclear planning group ministers noted that the various soviet proposals for a freeze on intermediate range land-based nuclear missiles would perpetuate the soviet monopoly in such missiles because not a single ss would have to be destroyed while nato would be prevented from deploying any such weapons <e> <s> ministers also expressed strong support for the united states commitment to negotiate an equitable and verifiable agreement on strategic nuclear weapons with the soviet union <e> <s> a copy of the full text of the communiqu has been placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the visit to moscow of which the noble lord was a member and i am also aware of the suggestions that he made and i am very glad that he did for unilateral action by the soviet union <e> <s> i think that only the third of his points namely the offer of a reduction can really come under the heading of a unilateral gesture <e> <s> that will be discussed and is being discussed in the talks which have started in geneva and so far as talks on strategic weapons are concerned they will start this year <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as positive responses or positive moves are concerned i should like to draw the noble lords attention to the proposal of president reagan which is supported absolutely fully in the communiqu of the nato nuclear planning group which i would ask him to look at in the library and which was for short called the zero option <e> <s> that offered to holdup the whole of the pershing and cruise missile modernisation plan if the soviet union would destroy its sss and other missiles <e> <s> we have no such missiles at the present time <e> <s> so that so far as responses are concerned i think it is true to say that nato and the americans have taken the initiative <e> <s> i think it is because we are negotiating from a position of strength that we are beginning to get and i am glad that we are replies and responses from the soviet union <e> <s> so far as the peace movement goes we have of course noted the peace movement in the usa <e> <s> i would merely say in relation to that and to the peace movement in this country that i think we are all in the peace movement but i believe that most of us feel that the cause of peace will be best served by multilateral disarmament with proper verification <e>", "<cs> my lords to be generous i would add to what my noble friend has said that the third point made by the noble lord lord brockway would indicate a slight lessening of that soviet preponderance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not an expert on rugby in the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not understood as the noble lord suggests that the adjournment of the talks i gather that in nearly all permanent talks there are adjournments was entirely a usa proposal <e> <s> i note that the noble lord is not nodding <e> <s> however i can assure him that the adjournment perhaps because the united states likes its easter recess as we do though to a greater extent has no other significance than that <e> <s> the talks in spite of the problems in poland and elsewhere are on and will continue on subject to a short adjournment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be an excellent idea if the soviet union were to respond to some of the suggestions we have made to stop tilting the balance against us to the degree that they have over recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords no date for the commencement of the start talks has been announced but it is believed and wished by the united states that they should begin this year <e> <s> i cannot give any further information on the possible meeting between president reagan and mr brezhnev <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for drawing attention to the continued soviet threat and i think that my original answer to him makes clear that we are mindful of the fact that our defence must be maintained in full <e> <s> as regards the use of particular classes of ship at the present moment i think that the operation has shown that really only this country apart from the super powers could possibly mount an operation of this size at this notice and i believe that there is nothing in our future plans which would prevent us from doing the same in the future if it were ever unfortunately necessary <e>", "<cs> that my lords is what i can assure the noble lord we are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is a separate question which my right honourable friend would be prepared to meet when the immediate operation is over <e> <s> i do however have to repeat that there is nothing in the plan for the defence of this country which still stands having been established last july which amounts to a reduction of the ability of the surface navy to mount this kind of operation <e> <s> the fact that we use the ships that are available at the current time does not mean that there are not ships of in fact greater fire power which will be available in future years <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that there will never be a day when we shall not study any relevant experience in relation to the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not studied the defence review or the annual estimates <e> <s> the policy of her majestys government has been to maintain two carriers two carriers will be maintained and are planned to be maintained <e> <s> the fact at the moment is that we have one old carrier and one new carrier <e> <s> under the plan as announced to parliament last year we shall move to a situation where we have two brand new powerful carriers <e> <s> i give that as an illustration of what i said just now the fact that we use all ships old and new being paid off service and coming into service as necessary at the present time is not a reflection on the power of the fleet for the future <e> <s> i have given the assurance that when current matters have been dealt with and are over any lessons that need to be drawn will of course be observed <e>", "<cs> my lords we are wandering from the question <e> <s> i am relying on my memory but in another carrier the illustrious is due to come into service and in the ark royal is due to come into service <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as the noble lords comment refers to this question in the end the extra cost will probably be found to be less than some noble lords might imagine because this is the use of our forces and not an addition to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord can ask the question but because it does not refer to the original question i shall not answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i can state categorically that there is no question at all of our

limited proportion of our defence budget which is spent on nuclear weapons <e> <s> certainly the government agree on the importance of sea power but i do not think i could sensibly add to the many commentaries and histories as to the parts played by all three services in the last two wars <e> <s> in relation to the dockyards there is no question but that the existence of all the dockyards which we had provided an administrative cost and tail which was limiting our ability to buy modern ships with extremely expensive modern weapons <e> <s> there will always be a change of emphasis and modernisation <e> <s> at present we have started on a dockyard reorganisation <e> <s> when that is complete both the dockyards and the royal navy will be as i said the other day in a very strong position should a call be made on them to rise to any emergency such as the emergency facing us today <e>", "<cs> i understand that that will be dealt with through the usual channels my lords <e> <s> i would just comment to the noble lord lord peart as i have commented before that in reviewing comparative strengths at one time and then at a later time one must take account of all classes of ships including submarines and all weapons including things like modern torpedoes and we shall be spending billion on modernising our torpedoes <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that the first part of that supplementary would best be raised in a future debate <e> <s> concerning the noble lords question about chatham and portsmouth in relation to the current emergency i have said before that in such an emergency we clearly need to use everything we have both those weapons and support facilities which are being phased out and those if we can bring them in more quickly which are coming in <e> <s> but that does not really have any bearing on the question whether the plan to base ourselves on two dockyards not one for the kind of force we shall have in future is or is not the best use of resources <e> <s> certainly at the time we did the review we felt it was and we must remember that we face a number of potential threats which have very different challenges and not just one at the extreme south of the south atlantic <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house i should like to repeat a statement which has been made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lords lord peart and lord banks for their general support for my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> they have echoed sentiments which i think both the statements of my right honourable friends clearly show and i shall not repeat them <e> <s> just to correct the noble lord lord peart the latest information which i included in my statement is that the one british casualty is in a satisfactory condition rather than the words which were in an earlier draft which i know that the noble lord has seen <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to lord kennets question is yes we are doing just that and will continue to do it <e> <s> we will continue to make clear to the rest of the world the facts as they become available to us and we will continue to press them to support our resistance to argentine aggression and our pressure for a withdrawal of the argentine troops <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is clearly an expert on torpedoes <e> <s> i believe the torpedoes used were those with which our submarine force is equipped for this purpose <e> <s> we shall not use more force than is necesssary to put aggressive argentine forces out of action <e> <s> having said that i also endorse my noble friends sentiment that it is the duty of the commander to make sure that that force is adequate so that british service lives are not risked <e>", "<cs> my lords of course that is so <e> <s> the commander has to have his rules of engagement which put him in a position to protect his task force <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and gallant lord lord hill-norton for those questions and his credentials for making this point are clear to the house <e> <s> certainly we shall try to do so well beyond this house and i hope his questions today will be reported <e> <s> he is absolutely right that in this modern highly sophisticated age of very dangerous weaponry of great range a commander cannot afford to take chances <e> <s> i also confirm that the answer to his second question is in the affirmative too <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of the noble lords views in relation to information and to putting over very clearly the facts of the military situation as far as we can <e> <s> i must tell him that large numbers of informed members of the public and others and he will have seen it in the press have pressed us to have a more secret operation and believe that we may already have given too much information to the enemy <e> <s> the balance between these two views is a difficult one <e> <s> i do not think the noble lord would want us to move in any way towards what i would call the argentinian position <e> <s> i think most noble lords would agree that we want to be extremely accurate and extremely careful in what we say and we certainly do not want in any way to give away information by inference or in any other way which may be of value to the argentines <e>", "<cs> i apologise for not answering that my lords but i do not think i can add to what is included in my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> the first attack on port stanley airfield left it unusable by transport aircraft from the argentine mainland <e> <s> there clearly was some small doubt that for light supply communications and ground attack aircraft it could perhaps in the future have been used and the further sortie this morning about which i am not in a position to give details was to ensure that its use for those purposes would also be denied <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord comes to read the statement he will see that it makes clear that the cruiser itself had six-inch guns with a range of miles and seacat anti-aircraft missiles <e> <s> its escorting destroyers were we believe equipped with exocet anti-ship missiles with a range of over miles <e> <s> that was in the statement and was part of the supporting statement of my right honourable friend to indicate that there was no question but that the attack group posed a serious threat to our task force <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords suggestion my lords but frankly i believe it must have <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for their observations for their sympathy which her majestys government share and for their admiration of the royal navy <e> <s> i do not think that lord pearts description of the conflict entering a new and more serious phase is the complete picture <e> <s> my right honourable friend has never underestimated what a formidable task lay in front of the task force <e> <s> when an aggressor has already committed aggression it is not easy to put matters right by the military route <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the house would want me to debate the theme behind the two supplementaries of the noble lord lord kennet but aggressors very often start with relatively small aggressions <e> <s> surely history shows us that if aggressions are not resisted they are likely to continue both there and in other parts of the world <e> <s> so i want to say to the noble lord that the number of the falkland islanders which is of course relatively small though i have not had the time or the mental agility to check his statistics who did not want to be occupied by a foreign power has i think only very small relevance in relation to the resistance to aggression <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the right reverend prelate for those most noble sentiments <e> <s> the house will have noted the sentiments expressed from my noble friends benches including those by the most reverend primate on the importance of the two principles which we are upholding <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for those questions <e> <s> i believe that the right honourable gentleman the shadow foreign secretary made remarks on the radio this morning if i heard him correctly which were very much in line with my noble friends sentiments <e> <s> any cease-fire at the current time with the argentinians still in occupation and without a guarantee that they will remove themselves would amount to game set and match to the argentinians <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord chalfont for those observations and questions <e> <s> the incident on the day in question was isolated in that area of the total exclusion zone although the shooting down of the harrier over the falkland islands was going on more or less at the same time <e> <s> but there can be no doubt whatever that in recent days there has been a sustained offensive and it has been quite clear from the movement of their forces that argentinian commanders have been under orders to attack our task force in every appropriate way <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not repeat the sentiments which have been expressed on all sides of <e>", "<cs> my lords we are redoubling our efforts to get the situation properly understood and to get the interpretation of our sinking of the argentinian cruiser in a threatening attack force into perspective <e> <s> it is regrettable that the world as a whole not reading the detail of all our statements has given undue attention to our declaration of the exclusion zones and has failed to observe the absolutely clear warnings that we gave the argentinian government on more than one occasion that any threat to our task force would be met with the appropriate action <e> <s> we are redoubling our efforts to get that understood abroad as well as at home <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the noble and gallant lords first question at this stage we have no information as to whether hms sheffield used the chaff decoy system that is one of the unanswered questions at this stage <e> <s> as far as the weighing of the risks is concerned i can assure the noble and gallant lord that the chiefs of staff and ministers debated these long and very carefully <e> <s> we did not underestimate the problems that exist nor did we underestimate the air power of the argentine which is the particular item in question at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords neither side has in the old-fashioned way declared war on the other <e> <s> i am not a lawyer but i understand that the majority of lawyers today take the view that we are not at war but that hostilities are being carried out under article no <e> <s> in self-defence which has been described many times before <e>", "<cs> my lords the latest information i have is that the sheffield is still afloat <e> <s> i cannot say more than that <e> <s> but she has been very badly burnt and almost certainly burnt out <e> <s> so far as future operations are concerned i think i have already made clear that the government do see the possibility we shall try to make sure that casualties are the minimum on both sides of further casualties taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords a heartfelt brief-free thank you for the first part of my noble friends supplementary <e> <s> i can assure him that the information that i have given to this house and that my right honourable friend has given to the other house has on every occasion been checked and cross-checked with the services to make sure that we do not give more information than is helpful to the position of our task force <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall leave the noble lord lord soper to continue the debate within the church on moral grounds on that i would not claim to be an authority <e> <s> but i have noted the many statements from a number of right reverend prelates which do not entirely agree with the noble lord <e> <s> so far as a temporary cease-fire is concerned i think that i have covered this question on more than one occasion <e> <s> but the difficulties of a temporary halt in operations have been made very clear by my right honourable friend the prime minister in the other place a week <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for making those points <e> <s> i do not think that we have underestimated the air capability and i would point out to my noble friend that previous air attacks which continued throughout a whole day were very effectively repulsed and argentine aircraft were shot down and they were unable to press home their attacks <e> <s> nevertheless we must not underestimate the particular capabilities of these five aircraft that they possess and we shall not do so <e> <s> i have temporarily lost the last point that my noble friend made i do not know whether he wants to make it again <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have said enough on the delicate balance which we are trying to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall leave my noble friend to deal with lord molloys point which can be dealt with better after his statement <e>

bbc peak-time comments <e> <s> neither yet has the bbc used the mod statement which after careful consideration in relation to security was released to the press and to the bbc on th may <e> <s> i am putting copies of that statement in the library of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that and the house of commons defence select committee have confirmed that situation in public also <e>", "<cs> my lords there was no method by which the ministry of defence could have known that the bbc news bulletin on the morning of the th was going to have a statement with as i have tried to explain inaccuracies some four times over and with implications which are good neither for the morale of the forces in the task force nor let it be said for the widows of the gallant men who died on hms sheffield <e> <s> had we been consulted had we <e>", "<cs> my lords in normal times pretty regular contacts take place between the information department of the ministry and all the relevant people in the media including the bbc <e> <s> at the moment with the emergency on special arrangements exist and one would have thought that those special arrangements or the telephone would have been used before putting out that statement with the inferences concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would walk round to the ministry of defence he would see that that great room downstairs is permanently laid out as a more or less permanent press conference <e> <s> representatives of the media the independent channels and the bbc are almost constantly there and mr mcdonald whom the noble lord mentioned just now is from time to time and as soon as he can bearing in mind the priorities which exist for using signal channels for operational reasons giving to the media full information that is compatible with security <e> <s> the contact is in both directions hourly at the moment <e> <s> the point however is that on this particular news bulletin at a peak time a programme was put out which had certain obvious inferences that hms sheffield could have been saved <e>", "<cs> my lords statements had been made regarding the loss of the sheffield <e> <s> there was no way in which the ministry could have foreseen that inferences inaccurate four times over were likely to be made <e> <s> as to the motives for making them no i do not accuse anyone of that motive but i do take note that that sort of inference appears in this day and age in a free country to have more news value than the sometimes boring facts <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that many of us have a great deal of sympathy with the noble lords sentiments <e> <s> we have heard it again declared that we are not at war that we are in hostilities that we have not got the arrangements which normally accompany war <e> <s> we are also carrying out hostilities miles away where communication is extremely difficult to arrange whereas the international facilities available to the news media in buenos aires are infinitely greater <e> <s> i should not like to give the noble lord the impression that we are entirely happy about the way in which this is working but we do have to put operations first <e> <s> in this situation we expect there to be a degree of cross-checking and responsible thought by the media before they come out with stories or allegations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to say anything further than i have already said <e> <s> i have given the house the facts <e> <s> i have pointed out that facts are sometimes more boring than inferences suggestions or sensitive questions

state for industry had made an ass of himself and at column in the same debate i suggested that time would show and <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side believe that the evidence is clear that the charge on the taxpayer and the public purse of the public sector as a whole is still far too large <e> <s> the progress that has already been made at this stage by taking a chairman from the private sector in the united states in this case is already evident even in the second half of the last year that has been published <e> <s> losses before interest declined from million a day in as a whole to million a day in the first half of <e> <s> i believe that the progress will continue and one part of the job and one of the criteria is privatisation <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> in answering a question however i wanted to try to put matters into perspective <e>", "<cs> my lords all i will say is that the very unhappy position of british steel when mr macgregor took over when it was literally bleeding to death through a major artery which no government could have sustained has now been <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the noble lords sentiment <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly accept what the noble lord says that neither he nor i on th may were looking at market estimates for steel which were anything like as depressed as the eventuality has in fact produced so

already evident and that more will be evident <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what the noble baroness would have wished mr macgregor to do with losses of million a day <e> <s> i believe that without the appointment of a man of his calibre and character and without the determined progress that lie is now achieving with a united team at british steel the ultimate redundancies in british steel would have had to be much greater <e> <s> as i say again i believe the day on which real progress can once more start has been brought immeasurably nearer by mr macgregor and his team <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that many steps have been taken in those areas in very difficult circumstances but mr macgregor himself has started surveys of every form of additional market that british steel might be able to meet <e> <s> those of us who mentioned at the time of his appointment that he was essentially a builder and a constructive man have had our thoughts also well borne out but we have to get to the end of an appalling recession in steel and to get the corporation competitive before that forward progress can really show <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the leader of the labour opposition and the noble lord lord mayhew for those sentiments <e> <s> i am quite sure that the task force and all those engaged in this operation will be well supported by the unanimity of this house on essential matters <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord thatthe commander will encourage surrender by any possible means <e> <s> indeed this we have always wanted to achieve in order to ensure that bloodshed is kept to an absolute minimum <e> <s> i can also assure the noble lord that there will always have to be a place for negotiations and that this dispute in the end from whatever position can only be settled by negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord kennet for his remarks <e> <s> as far as international support is concerned the noble lord will be aware that the security council as far as we know is still debating the situation but we believe and hope that their eyes are being kept fully focused on the fact that this incident started through unprovoked aggression by the argentine <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as opportunities are concerned they will be discussed through the normal channels <e> <s> i have before in this house suggested that the number of falkland islanders is not a relevant point <e>", "<cs> all dictatorship aggressors start with fairly small aggressions and all appeasement in the past has started with small appeasements but the example that would go out to the world if we gave in to this aggression would have repercussions all over the world and in the end this loss of life and liberty would far exceed the number of the falkland islanders <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state has before now answered questions on the case for a possible attack on land bases of argentina <e> <s> the government while not closing any options for the future have not regarded that alternative as one which would be fruitful in terms of the task before us <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson should take note of the progress of the air fighting over the falkland islands <e> <s> i very much doubt whether the losses which have been sustained by the argentinians over recent days and since the beginning of operations which amount to some combat aircraft can be sustained with the same vigour <e> <s> certainly if the argentinians suffer losses of more than per cent <e> <s> of the aircraft taking part in a raid then i think we are winning that battle without recourse to a major extension of the hostilities <e>", "<cs> my lords the media has been a problem in this situation of hostilities and not war <e> <s> while we have noticed the exceptions where things have gone wrong i believe that on the whole the governments decision to leave a free media and to ask the media to take its own steps to be responsible and the policy of issuing statements ourselves as early as we can of the true figures have kept the position under control <e> <s> it is the view of the chiefs of staff <e>", "<cs> my lords all of us enjoy being armchair strategists not least an old soldier from the last war but i think i will leave it to the commander as to how he should deal with the airstrip at port stanley

friend for raising that subject my lords <e> <s> i believe that standard practice does provide for what he has mentioned and that papers and instructions to all concerned have been got out <e> <s> as

"<cs> my lords the statement goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for their comments which are entirely in line with the governments feelings <e> <s> i said on monday to the noble lord the leader of the opposition that all tragic disagreements and wars and all military activities as these are have to end with negotiations and settlements <e> <s> that is well understood by the government but each situation is a new one <e> <s> but certainly we realise that in the end we need a settlement and one that looks to the future as well <e> <s> that does not mean of course that we

crisis and i believe we will continue to be so <e> <s> i said that the harrier had secured complete dominance in air combat <e> <s> that is to be distinguished from the degree of air superiority over the whole area that we have yet achieved <e> <s> but we have lost no harriers in air combat and they have shot down a large percentage of the total argentine losses that i have mentioned <e> <s> we have lost two harriers in offensive operations to ground fire <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my right honourable friends have made very clear on all occasion that in the end we want a permanent solution whereby the falkland islanders can live in peace in the area in which they are located <e> <s> there is nothing that will divert the government from that longterm aim <e> <s> i am afraid it has become clear that with the people we are currently dealing with in the argentine we are more likely to achieve that solution from a position of a greater balance of strength than we have been in the past by making major offers of concessions before our task force arrived <e>", "<cs> my lords i note once more the sentiments of the noble lord lord molloy with many of which we agree <e> <s> but i would rather not move from the effort that i have tried to make in my previous answer as regards the balance and the absolute need in the end to reach from a position of strength a settlement which will be secure and longterm for the south atlantic <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords suggestion and my noble friend sitting by my side will make sure that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for foreign affairs takes note of the noble lords views as he has already taken note of a number of constructive suggestions from members on all sides of this house for the long-term aim <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to add to what has been said by my right honourabe friends in the other place and by my right honourable friend the prime minister in this matter <e> <s> so far as i know no one has used the term unconditional surrender before <e> <s> we intend to reoccupy the falklands and to restore british administration to the falklands but we are ever ready to consider the situation from thereon of how we get to a permanent settlement in the area <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for those brief remarks and i understand them <e> <s> the only point i would make is that the bill before us now is to extend just one part of the industry act and that the industry act and other acts have been extended to give considerable support to industry <e> <s> there were also a number of measures in the recent budget which were designed to further support industry <e> <s> however i agree that this is not the time to debate the adequacy of those measures or the training measures we have introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will have noticed the use of the words minimum of six months <e> <s> the services do extend that period if there is a need for it to be extended <e> <s> if in the end a married quarter was very much needed and the widow still had not found a place to go to i should point out that the local authority could be required to find a place <e> <s> so far as other benefits are concerned it may interest the house to know and my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye asked me a question following a statement last week that the widow of a serviceman gets full pay for days if there are no children and for days where there are children <e> <s> at the end of that period she receives two pensions one from the ministry of defence and the other a war widows pension from the department of health and social security <e> <s> the latter is tax free <e> <s> both pensions are index linked <e> <s> in addition she is paid a substantial lump sum by the ministry of defence <e> <s> perhaps i could give an illustration of this because i think it would interest the house especially in relation to the tragic situation of some families concerned with the south atlantic <e> <s> a widow of a petty officer would receive pensions totalling over per annum and a lump sum of over <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i will write to the noble lord on that question but i would point out that we do not envisage this situation arising to any great degree bearing in mind the totality of the benefits and the fact that the six months period is a minimum <e> <s> indeed it is perhaps doubtful whether it would ever arise but i will let the noble lord know about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that this situation would only arise after the minimum period of six months extended if the married quarters are not urgently required which it would be <e> <s> only at that stage does the situation arise where under our normal requirements on local authorities they would be required to find accommodation <e> <s> i want to assure the house that there really is not a chance of the widow of a serviceman being evicted in any cir <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not in fact mention children in relation to the accommodation question <e> <s> i mentioned children in relation to the length of period for which the widow receives full pay after her husband is killed <e> <s> only in that context is there a difference <e> <s> there is no difference in relation to accommodation <e> <s> the full pay continues for days if she has no children and for days if there are children <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that this is not an instantaneous solution but neither is the question of requiring the widows accommodation an instantaneous one <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we might look at the official record <e> <s> i think i have covered the vast majority of it but if i find on consulting my officers that i have not i will certainly find a way of doing what my noble friend suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i will have to look at that and let my noble friend have the answer later <e> <s> i believe it to be tax free but i will confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> compared with the fourth quarter of the first quarter of shows a per cent <e> <s> increase in productivity in manufacturing industry <e> <s> this is indeed at a record level for all time and it is in spite of volume having improved only a little in the second half of last year and still being at roughly the same level as in the first quarter of this year <e> <s> as the house will know increasing productivity by those amounts without a volume increase of a substantial order is a remarkable achievement for british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord does not i think need to be reminded of the amount of competitiveness that we have lost over many recent years and of the need to regain that in comparison with other countries <e> <s> we still have a long way to go but we are certainly moving and moving in a real way <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed it is a fact that employment levels inevitably follow levels of competitiveness and shares of world markets that this country wins <e> <s> if we can keep these trends up there is no doubt but that unemployment will also turn but at a distance behind the economic factors <e> <s> i would add as one factor not yet mentioned the extremely good progress though it has not yet reached levels of which we should be really proud in the fight against the basic causes of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords although there has been rising unemployment in some industries particularly those where we have been uncompetitive for a long while there is solid evidence of rising employment in those industries which are competitive <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that if the economy becomes fully healthy again as it is now beginning to do the advantages of any black economy will be less and it will decline <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend and his point enables me to add that while our unit labour cost last year rose by only per cent <e> <s> which was better than the figures for the united states or france it was still behind those for germany and japan <e> <s> we have therefore a major backlog of uncompetitiveness which we still have to make up <e>", "<cs> my lords the question refers to the competitiveness of british industry and i take that to be both the private sector and the competitive part of the public sector <e> <s> i think the noble lords question is largely on other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that my affliction always makes it slightly difficult to hear the noble lord lord balogh <e> <s> but i think that the balance of economic points which i have already mentioned is an indication that although slow the foundations have been laid for a real economic recovery for this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i note that the noble lord does not find the signs that i have mentioned as obvious as i believe we on this side of the house do <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to repeat the statement made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state in the other place <e> <s> it reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for the support which they have given to the task force in their remarks and will when he has a moment draw them to the attention of the commander <e> <s> i believe that we are satisfied in the main with the equipment that we have on our ships <e> <s> it is true to say that in a wide area and outside the range of support from land-based aircraft prevention against the possibility of sneak attacks by determined pilots in the three dimensions of the air is not really a possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord kennet for his understanding about the comparatively small amount of detail that we can release at this stage <e> <s> so far as his point is concerned about the recent veto at the united nations yes indeed the reason was the lack of a link with argentine withdrawal <e> <s> i think i would be able to go further without in any way stepping out of line with my right honourable friend the foreign secretary by saying that one needs particularly when dealing with the argentine a degree of feeling of guarantee that words will be turned into action and to get that in the time available and at the speed necessary bearing in mind the weather and conditions in which our forces are operating is not an easy task <e> <s> i can only ask the noble lord to believe first that we know that in the end we need settlement and peace in the south atlantic but secondly that we have to put first the security of our task force and take account of the reliability in terms of turning words into action of the people who have invaded the falklands <e>", "<cs> my lords i have decided that it is quite impossible for my right honourable friend the secretary of state to please everybody in relation to information in a state of hostilities when the country is not at war <e> <s> there are those who ask him for more there are those who ask him for more earlier <e> <s> there are those who tell him to give less and to give it later <e> <s> i am certain that whatever my right honourable friend does he will be open to criticism <e> <s> there are important factors of every kind <e> <s> the military ones <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start by fully agreeing with and thanking the noble lord lord shinwell for his call for restraint in questions which i very much appreciate <e> <s> i do not think however that the ministry of defence has ever issued statements of imminent assault <e> <s> i do however understand i believe what is in his mind when he talks about political intervention and mentions the media also <e> <s> certainly we have discussed both my noble friend and i in this house following these statements the movements of international opinion and the logicality or lack of logicality for them <e> <s> i do not think it would be helpful for me to go over that ground again today <e> <s> i should like to say to the noble lord that although as the statement makes clear this is a setback my right honourable friend has always warned that there <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not accurate for the noble lord to say that the military advisers to the secretary of state the secretary of state himself or the government have for one moment set aside the principle of the need to get the greatest degree of air superiority that is possible in any area of conflict <e> <s> indeed the noble lord will recall not only the aircraft casualties of the argentine but the percentages up to per cent <e> <s> of the aeroplanes sent out by the argentines in a day destroyed <e> <s> i believe it is true to say that even beyond the range of support from land-based aircraft we have achieved a very high degree of air superiority <e> <s> but it is never or very rarely total and as i have said an aircraft can always get through <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord to remind me of the second part of his supplementary which was important <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend and i have replied to a similar question before and i really have nothing to add to the statement that we shall keep all military options open and we shall continue to do that <e> <s> the practicality of the course of putting an airfield of any kind even a small one with one airstrip out of action is well known to the military experts on each side <e> <s> it is not an easy task <e> <s> thus the military practicalities of the course leaving out any question of an extension of the conflict have to be very carefully considered <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord does not have his facts right and i am not prepared to put them right <e> <s> there has been mention of reinforcement of harriers by one ship or another going to the south atlantic <e> <s> we have never given total numbers and i assure the noble lord that his facts are not right in terms of numbers <e> <s> furthermore he will be aware that these days aerial warfare is fought not only by aeroplanes but by missiles also and we have inflicted very heavy losses on the enemy by surface to air missiles <e> <s> i would remind him that we have not lost a single harrier in air combat although the harriers have shot down the greatest proportion of over combat aircraft which the argentines have lost <e> <s> my previous statement that we have achieved a fair measure of air superiority is accurate <e> <s> of course we do pay and always have paid the highest tribute to the pilots of the harriers and to all of those who have been manning the missile systems under attack on her majestys ships <e>", "<cs> my lords i would merely say hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing to add to what my right honourable friend the secretary of state and i have said before on the subject <e>", "<cs> again my lords i would rather not go into military details <e> <s> i believe we have taken <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as information technology year is concerned there is a joint committee of the private sector of industry and government that has funded a budget of million for the awareness part of information technology year <e> <s> the expenditure of the government in this financial year on schemes some of which started some time ago but many of which have started very recently will be million <e> <s> as far as the accent on youth is concerned yes indeed i would say to my noble friend this is certainly a primary objective of my honourable friend the minister of information technology and during the year there is an exhibition at the science museum from april to august to which we hope a million people possibly many of them children will go <e> <s> the scheme to provide micro-computers in schools has reached nearly two-thirds of schools and by the end of my honourable friend hopes that every secondary school will have a micro-computer <e> <s> training at the new information technology centres is another plank of the youth scheme together with a scheme that he is now developing for summer camps <e>", "<cs> my lords i deliberately mentioned that many of the schemes had been started before but my honourable friend has accelerated them as i mentioned in the answer and has started many new ones as well <e> <s> acard is in existence and the continued response to the last acard report in this area goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a wider question but as far as the national health service is concerned it gives me the opportunity to say that one <e>", "<cs> i am terribly sorry my lords but i was trying to listen to two questions at the same time <e> <s> will the noble baroness repeat what she said please <e>", "<cs> my lords i am told that this is correct information but personally i have no information on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords mainly this is of course left to our industry whose efforts are being supported to a very considerable degree <e> <s> for instance some of the new schemes following the need for the development of fibre optics are deliberately designed to put our industry in a stronger position <e> <s> i think another area where the government are strengthening the base of industry is in the teletext and viewdata area where progress is being made and where the government are making essential co-ordinating and promotion effort and are endeavouring to help exports <e>", "<cs> my lords i will convey that sentiment to my honourable friend and it is all the more important for the fact that it is expressed by a member who has studied the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord tempts me to go wider than the question but certainly one of the most important fields for the application of electronics is the defence field and i think i would say to him that when we are able to give a full report after a <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the house will be pleased to have had that announcement <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that under previous administrations and under this one much encouragement has been given to the objective which the noble lord has outlined <e> <s> i will draw his further and specific remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall look up the noble lords words and write to him yet again <e> <s> in my reply on that day i drew his attention to the fact that reinforcements were sent there at various stages and that the number of aircraft deployed was very much greater <e>", "<cs> i was about to interrupt the noble lord on that but i will reply shortly <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord wedderburn for the briefness of his exposition of the amendment <e> <s> he is too suspicious in looking for government motives <e> <s> the last time he suggested we were going to increase to a major degree multi-unionism which i do not think followed from the words we wished to include <e> <s> this time he draws the conclusion that we are trying to promote the interests of non-independent trade unions <e> <s> i do not know how he squares that with the fact that section <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friends for their remarks almost all in support of the governments position <e> <s> i say to the noble lord lord oram that i am answering the proposition for the amendment as one who has in the past negotiated closed shops and been keen to do so within the british trade union position even though i had responsibilities in countries where they were not allowed and where there was no trouble because they were not allowed <e> <s> one thing is what is a sensible thing to do in the situation with which we have been living which the government and many people think is not a balanced one <e> <s> another thing is what industry will in fact do when the new law becomes accepted as i believe it will and when automatic fairly low-key checks become a regular part of our life a point to which i shall return <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord he thought the governments intention in this respect was unnecessary <e> <s> the noble lord lord rochester with qualifications which he later included also felt it was necessary <e> <s> the government believe that it is very necessary <e> <s> with the powers as they at present exist in union rule books the difficulty of bringing about a ballot if you are a minority is in fact very real <e> <s> we believe that the sandwell the strathclyde the wallsall dinner ladies and the british rail instances and the european court ruling all in their different ways also support the necessity for a move in this respect <e>", "<cs> with the permission of your lordships may i make just one point clear <e> <s> when i mentioned low-key automatic ballots i was referring mentally to the fact that the closed-shop continuation can be authorised by per cent <e> <s> of those voting <e> <s> in that sense there is no worry and no trouble <e> <s> a fairly small vote would provide a low-key automatic check which the union i am sure would organise <e>", "<cs> the possibility of trigger mechanisms has of course been well discussed both this afternoon and in the other place <e> <s> i am aware of the technical point to which the noble lord lord mccarthy has drawn our attention namely the lack of compatibility with the two lines which have been left in the bill as a result of the failure of the amendment last night <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should start by mentioning the part that i did not make clear <e> <s> in a non-closed shop situation where membership may be at any level any dismissal by an employer because an employee is not a member of a trade union will be unfair <e> <s> this is what we are dealing with unfair dismissals before tribunals <e>", "<cs> in a situation such as the noble lord postulates before this bill becomes law at all the noble lord either has to assume that because there is a closed shop now forget this bill people who are not members of unions and do not pay dues will have been fired or he has to assume that they have not subject to the flexibility for example on the odd conscience case and sometimes at the present moment a payment to charity <e> <s> i have to say to the noble lord that he may have his view about what this amendment is about but the amendment is within subsection of the new section and that subsection deals with conditions <e> <s> i will read the introduction <e>", "<cs> i believe it to be true and i do not want to weary the committee with detail but a majority of employees as a result of one of these cases affecting minorities had in fact voted that the closed shop should cease <e> <s> that was my single reference to majority <e> <s> in general i say to the noble lord the governments provisions are designed to protect individual liberty and the minorities <e> <s> the ballots when they get going will tend to show how many of these minorities there are <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the noble lord lord rochester and i want to correct only one point made by the noble lord lord hatch <e> <s> there is no question in the bill of the government telling anybody to hold a ballot <e> <s> the proposal is that if a company probably in agreement with one or more trade unions wants the protection of the bill to be able to deal in a closed shop position with a quite unnecessary rocking of that boat then it must have a check every five years by secret ballot to see whether the majority of those voting still want the closed shop to continue <e> <s> i believe that to be democratic and i resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to correct one detail <e> <s> what i hoped i said and what i certainly intended to mean was that the activating of the trigger mechanism which the amendment seeks to introduce would cause disturbance <e> <s> working up per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> or whatever proportion is decided in order to trigger a ballot would in itself cause more disturbance than would what i have termed a low-key automatic check <e>", "<cs> eighty-five per cent <e> <s> of those voting <e>", "<cs> no not i repeat for the automatic ballot it is pet cent <e> <s> of those voting <e>", "<cs> i wonder even if others may wish to speak to this amendment whether i could cut in at this stage because it may be possible that i can give at least some comfort to the noble earl who raised this question and the noble lord lord howie <e> <s> their sentiments are very much understood and accepted and i shall certainly not hide behind the problems of putting special cases in bills <e> <s> there obviously is such a problem and one does not want to do it if it is not necessary <e>", "<cs> so far as placing a copy of the letter is the <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i wonder whether it would save time if i intervened <e> <s> the noble earls amendment both the first part and the second part refers to the circumstances in which a dismissal is considered fair and not to the interesting questions which the noble lord is raising as to whether there are any means of preventing an employer from sacking someone unfairly for this or any other reason <e> <s> so that in this bill and in this amendment or lack of it what we are discussing is whether the clear indication that this would be unfair dismissal with what follows from it would be adequate to prevent it <e> <s> but i know of no other way and certainly this amendment will not achieve an edict over an employer which guarantees that he will not dismiss a man <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> my lords i have obviously encouraged the noble lord lord george-brown for whom i have great respect to say to me rather more times his side of the argument than i have yet said to him <e> <s> i shall not repeat it <e> <s> i have made clear that i believe we can set out the full reasons why these amendments are unnecessary <e> <s> what i do have to say as a point of fact is that the noble earls amendments are in relation to the subsection which deals with the situation of the conditions in which a dismissal is fair <e> <s> they are in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may just answer that question any noble lord who requires a copy of the letter should kindly let me know and i will give them one <e>", "<cs> may i very quickly point out that the words of subsection to which this subsection where the amendment applies is an exception reads <e>", "<cs> we have only done i think two amendments this afternoon <e> <s> there are another <e> <s> i have no right in any way to ask members not to speak but i wanted to say quickly at this stage which will mean that i need not say anything at the end that it might help your lordships to know the government view on this amendment <e> <s> this was all argued on the act as the noble lord lord houghton said so clearly <e> <s> we attach vital importance to the words which the amendment seeks to delete <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble earl who is not in the chamber at the moment does indeed wish to move the amendment and is in fact trying to get one piece of information which is of value to him <e> <s> while we are awaiting his arrival i can tell the committee that as i understand it his point is whether the words in line on page of the bill which read <e>", "<cs> i have spoken with the noble earl on this matter and i have told him that at the moment i have still not got per cent <e> <s> clear the position on the question of an appeal <e> <s> if it makes him feel any easier and i apologise for causing him to sprint i would say that my officials who were due to give me the answer have not returned either <e>", "<cs> the noble earl is concerned that the use of the word pending gives an impression of something in the future and that therefore the cut-off date for the provision might be early in the tribunals hearings or even before them <e> <s> i can tell him that that is not correct <e> <s> i can assure the noble earl quite clearly that a complaint is in fact regarded as pending before an industrial tribunal from the moment that it is lodged until the time when it is finally determined by a tribunal or withdrawn <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if the noble lord lord mccarthy was expecting more than i have given him but i believe that this degree of flexibility and the way of determining the ballot day in order to achieve this flexibility will be of value to more than just the shipping industry <e> <s> there are clearly problems in other areas <e>", "<cs> i believe that the number of days would have to be reasonable and that they would have to be reasonably close together but we have not defined a maximum number of days at this stage <e> <s> sometimes in committee work of this kind members of the committee use their minds to conjecture all sorts of possibilities but i cannot think of a good reason as to why the days should go on for more than a reasonable period and i feel my noble friend and i would probably agree on that <e>", "<cs> though lord mottistones amendment did not specifically refer to it the discussion touched on the question of the number of days on which a ballot could be taken and we have had the discussion on that amendment <e> <s> i know that my noble friend lord gowrie has in fact followed up since that discussion to check and if he finds there is anything that he wishes to alter in what he said i am sure he will do so now or find an opportunity to do o at a later date <e>", "<cs> i am still a fraction puzzled by the case which the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton sees <e> <s> i believe that this amendment is unnecessary and in order to give the reasons for thinking that i must just go over again with the committee the situation with which we are dealing under subsection at the end of which the noble lord wishes to add the sentence in his amendment <e> <s> subsection comes into being and its purpose is to ensure that in a case where there has been a wrongful expulsion from a union an unfair expulsion from a union which under section has been <e>", "<cs> i wonder if my noble friend has understood what admittedly is perhaps one of the most complicated parts of this clause because it depends on clause and what happens there and then on clause <e> <s> there is no question of giving away a little <e> <s> this covers a situation where a wrongful expulsion has been ruled on and as a result of it the union has said come back my noble friend into the union <e> <s> the clause says that if he does not say yes then a dismissal that might have been made could still be fair after the judiciary has ruled in his favour and the union has accepted it and offered him his membership back he says no in which case his dismissal would remain fair <e>", "<cs> i really am not trying to be difficult <e> <s> i do believe i have understood the situation <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins now suggests that there should be an obligation if the man has been wrongfully expelled that when he is offered his membership back he should pay the arrears of subscription during the period he has been expelled <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord means that but i would have thought that that was a rather unreasonable thing to do <e> <s> if he has been expelled wrongfully the subscription would become due from the date at which the olive branch is offered and he accepts it rather than through his fault refuses it <e> <s> then comes the question when should it he payable <e> <s> if you are saying that it should be payable instantly then you are making a special rule for the payment of subscriptions when a man rejoins the union at the time he does it <e> <s> i do not feel that that would be appropriate in an act of parliament <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble lord would let me intervene for a few seconds <e>", "<cs> i think that it may help at least i hope it will help <e> <s> the noble lord has quoted from subsection which begins <e>", "<cs> yes it says <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the amendment has the effect of making any arrangement which may be made with the agreement of both parties difficult or impossible <e> <s> the new bill and we have debated many of the clauses discusses the areas where a dismissal in a closed shop situation is regarded as fair and the areas where it is regarded as unfair <e> <s> we are really saying that these have changed we have discussed them <e> <s> in the areas where a dismissal would be unfair the employees agreement in the past when he was not protected as he will now be to make a payment in lieu either to the union or to a charity is overtaken by the bill <e> <s> in that condition he can use if he wishes the protection of the new bill <e> <s> if in some situations not in all the new bill allows him the protection of not being dismissed in certain circumstances without it being unfair then the fact that there was an agreement previously to pay an amount should not take precedence over the new law when properly enacted <e> <s> therefore i beg to move <e>", "<cs> perhaps i am not being clear but i want to make it very clear that this amendment does not make a charity option or a payment unlawful within an approved closed shop situation <e> <s> therefore the noble lord lord mccarthy is not correct in saying that we are effectively outlawing i think that he used words to that effect this practice <e> <s> i have deliberately not used his term agency shops which i think is a wide and sometimes argued description <e> <s> we are dealing with all the agreements that may have been made in the past and we are altering them only if an employee wishes to see them altered in an area where the new law gives him a protection <e> <s> but where it does not give him a protection where a closed shop has been legally approved for the purpose of this clause then any number of agreements to pay in lieu would still be possible if the trade unions and the management concerned were to adopt the kind of flexible approach to which i know the noble lord has subscribed <e> <s> so with that further explanation perhaps i could once more try to move this amendment <e>", "<cs> it depends whether he is an employee in an approved closed shop within the meaning of the act in which case if he does not wish to be a member of the union he has under the various provisions to make out his case for it but if his case does not fit then it would be an option for him to continue if the union agree to pay a payment in lieu of membership <e> <s> if indeed this employee is outside an approved closed shop or completeely excluded from the need to be a member then in those circumstances he need not adhere to paying these <e>", "<cs> i believe we have gone half way and we are giving employees their full rights under the new act <e> <s> we wish to make clear that an employee who has entered into an arrangement in the past when he did not have the protection of this act cannot be dismissed fairly if he does not wish to continue it <e> <s> outside a closed shop why should an employee have to make a charity payment <e> <s> the purpose of our amendment is to make sure that he does not have to in a situation outside the closed shop <e>", "<cs> could i make it clear that i was quoting the director-general of the cbi who feels that the bill is now just about right <e>", "<cs> i think i understand what the noble lord lord spens has in mind <e> <s> i should begin by drawing to the committees attention subsection of section a which declares <e>", "<cs> i think that that is a separate question from what is contained in the amendment which the noble lord lord spens has moved <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord campbell of alloway is a lawyer and i hesitate to suggest meanings of words but all of those entitled to vote have an opportunity of voting <e> <s> i should like to put it to my noble friend would a tribunal consider that there had been an opportunity if there had been no notification of the ballot to all employees <e> <s> i should have thought that that covered the situation <e> <s> i said earlier in relation to subsection that should it be necessary to spell out the conditions regarding holding a ballot then my right honourable friend will consider amendments but we really do not believe that it will be so necessary <e> <s> therefore i hope that we can have what i have called a low-key check where that is all that is required and thus avoid the problems of disturbance <e> <s> in our view for the reasons which my noble friend lord gowrie made clear disturbance would be caused by canvassing for a trigger mechanism <e> <s> i hope that we can avoid that and avoid dragging everybody to the polls when they all know of the situation and have an opportunity to vote <e> <s> so i hope i can persuade the noble lord lord spens having listened to those considerations to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment may i remind him that the provision to vote on more than one day and without a limit of numbers is in this bill <e> <s> among other things we hope that that will make possible a vote and will make it possible for whoever conducts the poll for instance in the shipping industry to make sure that everyone entitled to vote has an opportunity <e>", "<cs> i would be happy about that if the noble baroness was happy <e>", "<cs> we have been over quite a lot of this country a good many times <e> <s> i would start by saying to the noble baroness lady seear that i find it difficult to accept her statement of what a great problem it would be to get per cent <e> <s> of those who vote to vote in favour of a closed shop which is working very smoothly and very happily for all concerned <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether the noble lord has understood the point i was making <e> <s> the point is that if only per cent <e> <s> voted it was perhaps not a very exacting requirement because there was peace and nobody was very interested in spite of the ballot being promulgated <e> <s> it would not be very surprising frankly if the whole of the per cent <e> <s> voted for continuation <e> <s> in that context i would mention the two cases quoted by the noble lord in relation to a figure of per cent <e> <s> not being quite reached <e> <s> in both cases i understand that the figure of per cent <e> <s> of those voting was reached and was in fact exceeded <e> <s> i suggest therefore that there is some evidence on the first point raised by the noble baroness that the per cent <e> <s> alternative check particularly offered in areas where there were no problems is not a great difficulty <e> <s> the other part of this amendment and indeed the other part of various amendments including those spoken to by the noble lord lord jacques is the first only vote in the case of a new closed shop where per cent <e> <s> of those entitled to vote are required to vote in favour <e>", "<cs> if i may at this stage go on with the new closed shop and the second point raised by the noble baroness i am sorry if i have wrongly quoted the noble lords amendments in this context it is quite definitely the view of the government that a new closed shop should only be voted in by an overwhelming majority <e> <s> it represents a major change in conditions of employment <e> <s> it could be called a situation where the employee moves into an area where his permit to his job or his permit to work is controlled by a certain union that is proposing the closed shop agreement with the company <e>", "<cs> i was doing my research work to see why i had wrongly quoted the noble lord lord jacques as being interested in new closed shops <e> <s> the reason why i took it that he was is that his amendment no <e> <s> suggests leaving out the per cent <e> <s> which applies as a definite must for new closed shops rather than the per cent <e> <s> which he mentioned subsequently and reduced to two-thirds <e> <s> the noble lord is saying that if the employer and the union in an existing closed shop choose to have their agreement balloted under the alternative of per cent <e> <s> of those entitled to vote then it should be reduced to per cent <e> <s> and i now understand that he is referring only to existing closed shops <e> <s> i had not previously understood that <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i must resist this amendment which the noble lord has moved so briefly and i thank him for that brevity <e> <s> the suggestion that either employer or employee be able at the time of a ballot to check its validity is not one that we wish to accept <e> <s> we believe that the whole basis of this bill is that certain things require doing if protection is to be given to employees against unfair dismissal <e> <s> to put into the bill a requirement on tribunals to check the validity of a part of the procedure as it goes along would be an enormous extra burden one not really required <e>", "<cs> i would only very quickly say that i do not think that the noble lords scenario begins to be likely or to make sense at all and in any event the person holding the ballot and responsible for it will add up the vote will declare it to the employer and the union and will declare what percentage of people eligible has voted <e> <s> to have industrial tribunals to look into the machinery for which he is responsible and the possibility that he may may only in the unlikely case of individual employees or employers take a case to an industrial tribunal have to give evidence and make clear what took place to have a situation where checks on ballots and queries on ballots of those who do not agree with them can all be deluged on to industrial tribunals is really not a practical suggestion <e>", "<cs> in trying to hurry one succeeds in going more slowly <e> <s> in relation to what is suitable for the high court i shall leave it to my noble friend to give a lawyers answer <e> <s> but as i understand it the high court possibility and i tried to describe it would be there for someone who believes that there was something wrong with the ballot or the way in which it was conducted <e> <s> therefore if they want to refer a ballot that has taken place that they believe has been invalid for any reason i believe that they can take it to the high court and it would be appropriate for them so to do <e>", "<cs> if the case goes to the industrial tribunal as an individual complaint the first thing presumably the industrial tribunal will do will be to take the evidence of the person conducting the ballot in accordance with subsection ask for the results ask for the conditions ask for the entitlement to vote checks and which is what the tribunals are there to do check whether in that particular case of unfair dismissal the results were in fact valid <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord gowrie and i have already given the answers to the arguments of the noble lord lord mccarthy amendment by amendment as we have gone through the clause <e> <s> the government are not anti-union <e> <s> they are not even anti-closed shop and are not nearly so restrictive of closed shops as many other societies <e> <s> they believe in a balance between individual liberty and the encouragement of strong and responsible collective bargaining <e> <s> the public opinion polls of which i quoted only one have shown quite consistently not only the national public opinion but the opinion of trade union members themselves <e> <s> i believe that noble lords on the front bench opposite who have had long years of intimate connection with this world starting in a period when the balance of power was extremely different from what it is today are the ones who are living in the past <e> <s> i believe that this is a fair measure a balanced measure and i commend the clause to the committee <e>", "<cs> yes my lords indeed that is perhaps one of the most encouraging pieces of news <e> <s> in the first quarter of output per head in manufacturing was per cent <e> <s> higher than at the end of and a record for all time by quite some considerable margin <e>", "<cs> my lords within both my answer and the definition of manufacturing production only oil refining is included <e> <s> that does not alter the trends of the figures that i gave in my answer which no doubt the noble lord will look at in the official record <e> <s> so i have nothing to change in respect of that <e> <s> we have had a flat period after a per cent <e> <s> growth <e> <s> as far as most forecasts are concerned i have seen and will continue to see i believe variable forecasts but with the kind of return to competitiveness that we have started to see with these productivity figures there is little doubt in the minds of most forecasters that the upturn which started last year will be resumed <e> <s> the question is timing <e>", "<cs> my lords i made clear that by the autumn of last year we had seen a per cent <e> <s> increase from the low point at the beginning of the year <e> <s> i also made clear that since that period the output has been flat <e> <s> certainly the flat since that period includes a particularly low december result and a recovery from it in month-by-month figures since that time <e> <s> the noble lord will of course also recollect that we have had two rail strikes which did not improve the figures in march i think it was and will not be improving them at the current time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think those supplementaries though i understand my noble friends feelings on this subject are wide of the question <e> <s> the employment legislation the act that we have enacted and the bill that we intend to enact will help to improve our competitive position <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not agree with any of that <e> <s> the share of world markets held by british manufacturing goods was as i have so often said halved between and and it was still in a very had shape when we came to power <e> <s> the results of this were hidden from the british people because world growth during the sixties and seventies was unique and we shall probably never have a period like it again <e> <s> we are now beginning to recover the competitiveness which was lost over all those years one has to say under all governments <e>", "<cs> my lords there is evidence that the productivity increases which i mentioned stem from the better use of existing investment which is the really important thing <e> <s> investment is continuing and there is indeed a slight upturn in investment intentions <e> <s> as far as the public sector is concerned yes there has been a great deal of investment in that area also <e> <s> while there is some evidence of much better use of that investment in some of our nationalised industries there is certainly not enough evidence of that investment being properly used <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to point out as i said very clearly in my first answer that output per man has reached an all-time high well above any of the levels that were reached under the previous government <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that is correct <e> <s> output per man in manufacturing industry is well above any previous year <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord to look up the position and perhaps he will let me know if he can find any other facts because they do not exist <e>", "<cs> my lords i would rather not be drawn on to that one but yes i very much agree that current industrial disputes are never helped by public statements <e>", "<cs> my lords until british industry is fully competitive and starts to regain the share of world markets which we lost under previous administrations the future levels of employment will never be secure <e> <s> once that competitiveness has been regained and once we start to regain that share of world markets employment will follow <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he will tell us whether the plans of his party to bring the spending on defence down to the average level of our nato european partners are still in existence and whether he would contradict the statement that i made that that amounts to times the cost of trident over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i think that when the noble lord reads the <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been estimates already made public and i will return to that matter in my summing-up later rather than intervene during the noble lords speech unnecessarily <e> <s> the point i make is that the main cost of the forces is their existence and their equipment <e> <s> you have them <e> <s> what the falklands has shown is that they are not so unsuitable for out-of-area they can be made suitable with a little amendment with great courage and a great measure of flexibility as has been shown <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord may not be able to stay until the end of the debate i should like to ask him for some clarification so that i may answer his questions later <e> <s> is he in fact recommending that we maintain the polaris system through the s and into the next century <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not feel any happier with a repeat performance trying to answer noble lords in the whole wide area of defence whereas noble lords have mentioned that the other place has allotted five days <e> <s> a knowledge of the subject which i am getting a little of these days is not a help to proceeding very quickly if one is to go over the problems in more detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i must answer speakers and i want to get through inside half an hour <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is an excellent idea <e> <s> this is another trigger amendment which apart from the discussions in the other place to which the noble lord has referred has been very well discussed in this house at the committee stage <e> <s> the noble lord who moved the amendment suggested that we ought to have been more attracted to it because of our views about contracting in and contracting out <e> <s> frankly i think that analogy bears on an individuals right to contract in and out <e> <s> in an authorised closed shop subject to the provisions concerned he has to contract in and cannot contract out so i do not accept the analogy <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i may intervene to make the noble lord lord oram aware that the representatives of the social democratic party behind him nodded when i asked them whether they wanted to say anything further that is to say they nodded that they did not want to say anything further <e>", "<cs> my lords just let me say to the noble lord lord mccarthy that i certainly do not today want to enter into the question of whether or not there is a case for changing or regulating rule books <e> <s> i merely pointed out that the existence of the rule book and not just the expulsion clause together with the closed shop creates a very strong position <e> <s> many of us who have spent our working lives in factories know that the pressure can be considerable and that it is not easy in a closed shop situation to put forward something that a union may feel is against their interest <e> <s> we still feel that and i would say to the noble lord lord hatch that there is less likely to be disturbance even in extremely contentedly working closed shop areas by an automatic ballot which we believe even unions will come to welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i did use certain words which i hope will be clear when the noble lord lord mccarthy reads the account <e> <s> i mentioned that this conflict of interest was not specifically covered <e> <s> we still felt as we expressed both in the committee stage and in the letter that in all probability the bill would have covered an unfair dismissal in this situation <e> <s> but we believe that due to the particular pressure of a conflict of interests including areas where there was statutory backing to that conflict of interests this issue should on reflection be specifically covered <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asked me a similar question last year and i am afraid i must say to him straight away perhaps in order to discourage him from asking the same supplementary questions that i have nothing further to tell him beyond what i said in july <e> <s> on the particular point of the age of the aircraft i am informed that two of the andovers were manufactured in and one in <e> <s> on the safety record of the aircraft bearing in mind all incidents that have taken place and the special standard of maintenance together with the hours flown by these aircraft which are considerably fewer than the hours flown by standard raf <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for that question and perhaps adjuster of my answer <e> <s> certainly there was nothing in my previous answer nor that of my right honourable friend the prime minister to say that without question these aircraft will go on for an indefinite period <e> <s> we shall keep the matter of replacement of these aircraft and of those in the communications squadron under review <e> <s> various modern aircraft made in this country are obviously candidates when the day comes when we believe that this becomes a real priority <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said in answer to these questions before whenever her majesty flies abroad on any long-distance trip she travels in a vc whenever she wants an hs for a particular visit she has it <e> <s> taking account of the nature and frequency of the journeys that the queens flight is called upon to make and the aerodromes at which it is called upon to land together with the current equipment backed up in the way i have suggested the particular aircraft in the queens flight are not unsuitable for the task <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his supplementary question <e> <s> i value his contributions with all his knowledge of the aircraft world and i share his wishes for the support of the launch of the which i believe is an excellent aircraft and which as i have already said is certainly a candidate when the day comes to consider aircraft for either the communications squadron or the queens flight <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that <e> <s> i am lucky enough to be able to use whenever aircraft are not required aircraft of the queens flight and i have never had any such episode occur <e> <s> i have travelled in the greatest comfort with the utmost speed and reached my destination bearing in mind the kind of aerodrome one lands on as quickly as i would in a modern aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not answer that question for the specific reason that when the head of state travels abroad she rarely unless it is definitely required for the purpose concerned travels in an andover aircraft <e> <s> she in fact travels as my noble friend believes his chief executives always travel in a suitable aircraft for the job <e> <s> i should think that there are chief executives of companies in this country who do travel in everything down to their own small aircraft which they can pilot and land where they wish to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that the minstry of defence has leased about acres of land from the national trust for a period of years and has licensed a further area for years for the dumping of spoil <e> <s> the leased area is required for a raf operations centre <e> <s> careful landscaping will ensure that when the project is completed there will be virtually no visual impact on the surrounding area <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend goes too far in asking me to agree all the details of his supplementary <e> <s> what i can say is that there is no question but that in my opinion the fuss created within the national trust seems to be about national policy matters related to armament and disarmament which is not within either the objectives or terms of reference of the national trust <e> <s> the national trust did indeed negotiate this lease and licence extremely meticulously in relation to its objects and terms of reference <e> <s> it was not until the ministry of defence was able to satisfy them fully that there would really be no lasting effects on the environment indeed when completed and when the trees are grown some might say it was an improvement that they were prepared to grant the licence and lease <e> <s> i hope very much that the matter can be kept on that basis and not turned into an argument on disarmament which has nothing to do with the case <e>", "<cs> that is not so my lords i have mentioned the acreage acres are at stake and while the national trust must speak for itself i believe it is totally satisfied that the area after it has been carefully landscaped will be both decorative and fertile that is on this acres of land and the noble lord seems to be worried about its fertility so i could not agree with the line of his supplementary <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is unthinkable that the national trust should not be allowed to lease land for any legal purpose which does not cause an eyesore to the environment or upset in any other way the objects of that excellent body <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that comment my lords <e>", "<cs> i understand that that could possibly have been the case my lords but i assure the noble lord that it never entered our contemplation at all <e> <s> we carried out the negotiations with professional and expert people and we were able to satisfy them that they could grant a lease within their terms of reference <e>", "<cs> my lords work began in may of this year after a properly negotiated lease had been obtained and all the necessary legal permissions granted <e> <s> the noble lord asks me to agree that this was a spontaneous local protest <e> <s> i leave the house to judge <e>", "<cs> my lords i will let the noble baroness have a detailed answer to that supplementary because it is not a question i have asked <e>", "<cs> i accept what the noble lord says my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as her majestys government are concerned they have made statements at various times of which i know the noble lord is aware on the support which we give to the rapid deployment force and the fact that support in permanent and assigned kind can be only very small indeed <e> <s> i have nothing new to say on that subject <e> <s> this afternoon i shall in the debate before us be talking a little about out of area questions <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an honour but a frightening one to find myself opening in support of the foreign affairs and defence section of the humble address and for your lordships i fear a poor substitute for similar motions which have been initiated by my noble friend lord carrington in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will allow me to interrupt <e> <s> he has had explanations from myself and i think other spokesmen from this bench on more than one occasion and in writing that for very obvious reasons it has been the policy of every government neither to confirm nor deny on any single occasion the location presence or absence of a nuclear weapon or where it goes <e> <s> the noble lord continues to ask these questions with in my mind one view only in order to use the obvious difficulty of the government in replying to carry with his question a suggestion which is quite unfounded <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to suggest to the noble lord who has been a prominent member of a certain unilateral disarmament movement that next time he visits moscow he should ask loud and clear which soviet submarine is carrying nuclear weapons when it goes near any baltic nation or any other nation <e> <s> he will not receive a clear answer and for the same reasons i shall not give him one <e> <s> i do not think that the house will welcome the kind of propaganda that his questions serve to try to discredit this country in areas where national security cannot allow a definite answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is simply making up his ninepins in order to knock them down as he goes along <e> <s> i said no such thing and the political control that we have and the allies have over all of our defences and security is in my view per cent <e> <s> sound and permanent <e> <s> the noble lord is really inventing these assertions and questions for a purpose of propaganda which is not in the interests of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter is extraordinarily important <e> <s> the noble lord has very nearly done me justice <e> <s> i actually asked the question whether if nato did this the aggressor would retaliate whether he would escalate and whether it was in his interests <e> <s> i leave the house to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only ask the noble lord to read <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord earlier put great faith in the international institutes figures of comparison and i know that he has read them carefully the last two years reports <e> <s> i know they have confirmed clearly the great swing that has occurred and is still going on at the present time towards the balance tilting in favour of the soviet union heavily in the intermediate area nearer equal in the strategic <e>", "<cs> that is why we back the american moves to multilateral disarmament my lords <e> <s> the fact that the allies spent less in all areas on defence and declined as a percentage of their gdps was not matched by the soviet union which built up its arms in the opposite direction <e> <s> the reversal of that may lead to multilateral disarmament which is what we all want <e>", "<cs> my lords first let me say to my noble friend that the changes will be phased according to the negotiations which are taking place <e> <s> thus it is very much in the mind of her majestys <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords points and his sentiments <e> <s> in a changing situation there was in the opinion of her majestys government no possibility if we were to keep the maximum expenditure on front line units for the royal navy of maintaining the huge dockyard structure that we had for royal navy work <e> <s> we do believe however that the commercial alternatives of which a p appledore internationals has been chosen as the most likely may well provide a viable future in present circumstances for the important gibraltar dockyard <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must await the white paper on the falklands for any changes of emphasis that may seem desirable from that <e> <s> but the gibraltar base will be retained just as portsmouth base is retained <e> <s> bases are quite different from dockyard support and unnecessary expenditure on the tail and administration of our fleet is not a help to maintaining the most effective fleet that we can <e>", "<cs> my lords let me assure my noble friend lady vickers that gibraltar dockyard workers for all the purposes of redundancy are united kingdom citizens and they are fully entitled to their redundancy pay <e> <s> let me then say that at this stage with discussions currently going on with officials which will be continued this month and next it is far too early to know the quantity of redundancies either in the middle term or longer term i have already covered in my answer to my noble friend lord merrivale the question of the shorter term <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the opposition will recognise that although this is an overlapping subject to a high degree it is a separate subject <e> <s> we very much hope that the lisbon agreement which was unfortunately held up during the falklands operation will be implemented by the new spanish government <e> <s> it is too early for me to say anything definite as to when they will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady vickers invariably asks me something which i have to promise her a letter to answer on this occasion that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for their constructive comments <e> <s> they were long enough to keep me busy for what could be a full-scale debate <e> <s> perhaps both noble lords will excuse me if i answer them very briefly on this occasion and take the opportunity to say that through the usual channels it will probably be desired that time should be set aside for a debate and that i am informed that this will be possible when we resume after christmas <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord kennet will forgive me if i say that this is a white paper on the falklands and the lessons from it and is not a further discussion for which we shall have plenty of opportunity on defence as a whole with particular reference to nato <e> <s> i should unduly impinge on the time of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i will say to the noble and gallant lord lord hill-norton also that i will be fully prepared and willing to debate all those points in much more detail as and when time is allocated for a debate <e> <s> so perhaps he will forgive me for giving very short answers at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say to my noble friend that nothing in my right honourable friends announcement this afternoon will have any adverse effect on the air defence of the united kingdom <e> <s> in the white paper he will find that it is our intention to purchase at least extra phantoms from the usa if we are able to do so not all of which will be necessarily committed to the falklands so there will be an augmentation of air defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i would merely say to the noble lord lord shinwell yes there will be a debate and so we can come back to these questions <e> <s> he began by saying that everybody would agree that defects had been exposed <e> <s> i think it would be astonishing if a nation went to war and was unable to find any lessons for improvement <e> <s> what the statement and the white paper make clear when the noble lord has time to read them is and to me it is remarkable that we did have the forces and the equipment capable of accomplishing a uniquely <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins should be pleased as indeed i am that these awesome weapons are more accurate and can therefore be an even more effective deterrent than their previous generation <e> <s> but i am absolutely clear that nato and europe as president reagan has repeatedly made clear have made entirely clear that no weapon will be used unless there is aggression <e> <s> therefore although the weapons themselves will change there is no change in the deterrence strategy which has kept the peace of the world for the last years <e>", "<cs> my lords i noted the words of the noble lord lord bishopston and i certainly intend him no smear whatever <e> <s> i have a certain sympathy as to his ability to reconcile those words with the degree to which his official party spokesmen have moved to a nuclear unilateral position in recent public broadcasts <e> <s> one has to observe the degree of similarity of much of what the noble lord lord jenkins in particular says on each occasion with the propaganda that is coming out of soviet news agencies day in and day out <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is a privilege of back-benchers to be able to speak a little more widely on the subject under debate than one has been able to do from the front bench <e> <s> it is certainly a privilege not to have to answer eminent speakers and my commiserations go to my noble friend lord belstead in taking on that task <e> <s> it would be <e>", "<cs> indeed there is my lords <e> <s> they have a very considerable number of nuclear submarines and they are building more of them all the time <e> <s> it is certainly part of the threat but it is of nothing like the same magnitude as the land-based intercontinental missiles <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the ministry of defence looked with great care into the question which the noble lord lord jenkins raised at the time when he raised it and that even the then minister of state looked into the details <e> <s> would he also agree that it is at the moment at the very least premature to give any inference that there is any connection between the complaints based upon the incidence of cancer in a few of those who took part in the tests and the tests themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely pleased to be able to support the motion moved by my noble friend lord carrington and i have only one complaint against him that is that he moved it so conclusively and overwhelmingly that it makes it rather hard for his supporters to continue with the speeches that they had in mind <e> <s> i do not feel that the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos answered my noble friends question and perhaps it was a good thing that he did not answer in detail as to what is the policy of the labour party in this area because its spokesmen at least in public have undoubtedly moved to a position which is very close to that of unilateral disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no official position from which i speak <e> <s> i made very clear on i th january some of the main comparisons of tanks of aircraft of the sss of all the weapons particularly of those with application to offensive use in europe and i mentioned the many s to s and s to s <e> <s> i said this in this house without challenge from the noble lord <e> <s> if he will study with me at any time the force comparisons of nato <e> <s> i believe he will see that all those figures were fully justified <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the last estimate that the government made in relation to trident was million and not million as stated by the noble lord opposite <e> <s> further would my noble friend remind the house that that is to be spread over a period of over years and constitutes approximately per cent <e> <s> of our defence budget <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that in the world as it is and not the world as we might like it to be the argentine will in the future as it has in the past buy modern arms from our industrial competitors if not from ourselves <e> <s> would my noble friend also agree that no criticism should attach to the labour administration of for signing a large contract for destroyers and modern weapons for supply to the argentine because in fact we at least knew exactly what those arms would do when the regrettable conflict took place <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the arrest of the decline in the volume of manufactured goods and now the signs of modest growth in a static world market prove that we are overall competitive for the first time in two decades <e> <s> those two decades were in the s and s when we lost half our world market share <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the important point is to continue to prevent war through remaining strong and deterring any possible aggression <e> <s> further would he agree that if we one-sidedly throw our weapons away we should make war and the loss of our freedom much more likely <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that our peace and security depend on the nato alliance working in harmony and that five countries are to provide sites for missiles of two kinds <e> <s> does he further agree that the worry about cruise missiles in the united kingdom is more a theoretical than a practical one hearing in mind that these missiles are in our country on bases guarded by our troops <e> <s> they would have to be moved to sites for operation escorted by our forces <e> <s> apart from the very thorough joint decision arrangement will he agree that there is no possibility that these missiles could be used from our country against the will of our prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords let me add my congratulations to the noble lord lord gallacher <e> <s> i hope that he will contribute often to our debates <e> <s> let me also say to the noble lord for whom i have great respect who introduced this most important debate that i have sufficient regard for his timing in placing the motion at this time to say that i think he has done the house of lords a great service in putting on this extremely important debate on a subject on which we shall be no doubt hearing a great deal more throughout the election <e> <s> in particular at this moment our <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said to the house was that our standard of living was not only maintained but improved in spite of losing half our share of a doubled market <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will allow me to say that i entirely accept <e>", "<cs> my lords we have indeed lived and are still living through a period of pretty unique industrial history with some enormously violent changes which have taken place in the s and s and are still taking place in the s <e> <s> at the risk of boring your lordships i am afraid that i am going to put my gramophone record on again which in my view makes it abundantly clear and this follows very much the line of the remarks of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that it is the years of fools paradise in the s and s that have caused unemployment today <e> <s> i agree with those who say that unemployment has not all been caused just by the world recession of very recent years <e> <s> but that recession caught out the country which had become progressively more and more uncompetitive over those fools paradise years <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will let me finish my point about the exchange rate i shall then give him an opportunity to intervene <e> <s> i believe that we had a period of aberration in exchange rates due to the factors that i have mentioned and sonic others which there is not time to mention <e> <s> i believe that is was an aberration and i think and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the many different opinions that there were at the time and that there have since been there will always be different opinions on that question <e> <s> i have given the house my opinion with the benefit of having listened at the time to the academics as well as to my colleagues and to experts <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said was that our industrial production outside construction had a better performance in the last months than all our main industrial competitors based on the last three months for which figures are available <e> <s> that is correct <e> <s> the change in our balance of payments in visible trade analysed correctly by the noble lord is due to the years of fools paradise during which as i tried to explain we lost half our share of the world market <e> <s> then when the recession came we were caught out and the chickens came home to roost with the result that the noble lord has indicated <e>", "<cs> my lords my first and very pleasurable duty is to add my congratulations to those of other noble lords on the maiden speech of the noble and gallant lord lord lewin <e> <s> i was privileged as an itinerant minister of which he saw many in his long career not just to know him and to see him at work over two years but to see part of his great contribution in the falklands <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that in so far as we have a small deficit in manufactured goods in terms of trade today it stems directly from a drop in our share of world markets from nearly per cent <e> <s> in to under per cent <e> <s> in <e> <s> under this administration and the previous one would he agree that the slide has now been arrested and that we are starting to regain our share notwithstanding the world recession <e> <s> would he further agree that we now have a chance to start to catch up in prosperity the nations that overtook us in the s and s <e>", "<cs> my lords will not my noble friend agree that the trends in total unemployment in the past four months have been surprisingly encouraging considering that the economy has only recently turned upwards in britain and britain has only recently become competitive and started to regain market share <e> <s> will my noble friend agree that this is perhaps because we live in an age of change and the new jobs are coming in new industries in small numbers at a time while the old industries continue to decline and catch the news headlines <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am very glad that i am not still with the department of industry <e> <s> i have a great deal of sympathy with my erstwhile colleagues in government at this time <e> <s> like most others on this side of the house and some on the other side <e> <s> i fervently believe in competition and believe that normally that is more easily achievable in private enterprise <e> <s> also while agreeing with the noble lord lord weinstock that management is absolutely key i believe that on the whole one gets both a type of management and more important a performance out of management when one has both the discipline of competition and of the individual profit and loss account which my noble friend lord mottistone spoke of <e> <s> indeed some of those who have been recruited into some of our public sector enterprises in recent years in my view have only joined because they have been able to see the light at the end of the tunnel and a possibility of private enterprise when they get there <e>", "<cs> my lords i made that point against the background of inevitable job losses through mechanisation and new equipment that british telecom would have to install in any event <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give the house a little more information on the timing of phase <e> <s> may i say that i too welcome this decision having been at the department of industry and played a part in the negotiations for many months in <e> <s> i am entirely satisfied that the net employment benefits to this country can be very great indeed <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the movers of this amendment would accept that my noble friends answer in relation to the appointment of the director general by the secretary of state really is unarguable <e> <s> if the secretary of state is to be responsible to parliament for the activities of this vitally important area he must have the usual right to appoint the director general <e> <s> perhaps the movers of the amendment would like to consider whether the advisory functions which are in the other part of the amendment should be strengthened in a different form of amendment <e> <s> that would seem to me to be a subject well worth further discussion <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> does he not realise that the bill for the nationalisation of british aerospace was to many of us just as emotive as this one <e> <s> what we are talking about is whether within the context of this bill we can revise it sensibly <e> <s> in those terms we should remember that the noble lord lord beswick continued his contract with british aerospace under a conservative government <e> <s> we thank the labour

arthur cockfield as he then was got his second term in charge of the price commission under a labour government <e> <s> let us keep politics out of these bills <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend in replying to the amendment can provide any information about the accuracy of the assumption that rural areas are perhaps the most uneconomic places for the extension of lines and the installation of call boxes as well as the other matters mentioned in the paragraph to which the amendment relates <e> <s> i have in mind the appalling degree of vandalism in the towns <e> <s> i have a feeling that although the lines are longer the actual economics relating to rural areas may not be as bad as so many of your lordships fear <e>", "<cs> am i right in assuming that the amendment as written would mean that it would literally have to be penny post that is that a trunk call would have to cost exactly the same as a local call <e> <s> i am not a lawyer but i would think that that could be an interpretation of this <e> <s> i further should like to re-emphasise once again that we have not got a shred of evidence that with growing automation in all areas rural calls are going to

noble friend not agree that nowithstanding the understandable concern over the decision-making on these awesome weapons the most important factor to ensure peace is the perception of any potential aggressor <e> <s> his perception must be of a free democratic alliance which is necessarily cumbersome but which nevertheless is in a position and able to make any aggression too costly to contemplate <e> <s> in plain words let us keep this matter in perspective i hope my noble friend will agree and make sure that any potential aggressor knows he cannot get away with it <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with some of the thoughts of the noble lord lord bruce of donington on this subject <e> <s> i feel that he has not got off his pram but he has gone a little over the top <e> <s> i will reserve my main remarks for an amendment that among others is down in my name amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not think i could support the noble lords amendment because it is phrased so deliberately anti-import and the practicality of exact reciprocal agreements between different countries is something that no secretary of trade under either government has ever been able completely to achieve <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend answers i must direct his attention to the wording at the beginning of clause where it says <e>", "<cs> in withdrawing this amendment at this stage perhaps i may make a request and a couple of remarks to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i have spent my life in manufacturing industry and four years in government including a period when i was at the department of industry <e> <s> i have not the smallest doubt that we are less french than the french and that in a number of cases we have not given our manufacturing industry the same degree of support as other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend go a little further than he did in answer to lord aldingtons supplementary question and confirm that the basic helicopter is one of the first instances of defence equipment which will be suitable for a very large civilian market <e> <s> also does he agree that this represents an agreement of which there have not been too many in the past between the ministry of defence the department of industry and industry itself to combine a civilian market and a defence market and this is to be welcomed in every way <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the competition in the basic network is as he described it mercury only <e> <s> the competition in apparatus in value added services and probably in international services is quite different <e> <s> the problem is as the noble lord stated it and i am only amazed at his amazement namely that british telecom will be in an enormously strong monopolistic position for a long while to come in the basic network <e> <s> it is also involved in the other areas where large numbers of firms big and small are also involved <e> <s> unless it separates its accounts for its businesses properly it will be extremely hard for the director of oftel to ensure what is and what is not a fair or unfair competitive position outside the basic network operation <e> <s> it is in the interests of british telecom itself that it should be <e>", "<cs> the reason why i would not concern parliament with that point is that it is not in a very strong monopolistic position <e> <s> in many cases it will have extreme difficulty in being able to get fair competition <e>", "<cs> so far as i can remember it is not a condition of any companies act that accounts be kept for certain separated parts of the business <e> <s> so i am not impugning any auditor about anything <e> <s> i am merely pointing out that this very large public monopoly in one area of the telecommunications world will continue as the noble lord himself said to be a near monopoly in a private sense and that in that situation it is very difficult even by accident not to price unfairly a small section of your business which is completely lost in the total acounts of this huge enterprise <e> <s> it is also extremely hard even if you try not to do so to avoid conditional selling <e>", "<cs> i must not detain the committee but i would not suggest making that a <e>", "<cs> if it helps my noble and learned friend perhaps i can speed things up and make up for a little of the time that the noble lord lord bruce and i have used <e> <s> if he were able to assure me that he would draw to the secretary of states attention this exchange today and ask whether there is a possibility of the conditions in the licence condition no <e> <s> in particular being drawn slightly differently to include the value added services i should be prepared to withdraw the amendment today and wait upon his reply as to whether it is possible <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend can tell me whether the role of other ministers will be mentioned in relation to this centralisation including such things as the centralisation of defence procurement <e> <s> are they mentioned and how do they fit in with the apparent absolutely central staff relationship <e> <s> secondly may i ask him whether the central staff will be in addition to the staffs of the three services or whether if i understood him correctly this is a movement of the individual services staff to the centre <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend answer my first question <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> the concept of fair competition is very important particularly in the context of this bill because of the size of one of the main operators <e> <s> it is more appropriate for a government to use their best endeavours which is what in my view the introduction in subsection to the various paragraphs in this case paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there are other amendments that cover the same point <e> <s> i had <e>", "<cs> my lords let me add one comment to what my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil has just said <e> <s> if we are talking of days weeks or even months as a regular occurrence one might not think the importance of this point was so great <e> <s> however thinking about the situation leads me to believe that in the majority of cases by the time a practice has been discerned by the time it has been brought to the attention of the director by the time he has investigated it and by the time he has declared himself we shall in the majority of such cases if they arise have covered a period of probably years <e> <s> in that situation i feel that the spirit of the amendment of my noble friend lord morris must be met and i hope very much that my noble and learned friend on the front bench will be able to tell us how he is to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down may i just ask him this <e> <s> he has gone some way to relieve my fears by pointing out that the date for damages is effectively the issue of the provisional rather than the final licence <e> <s> but if heavy damages have in fact occurred before the issue of the provisional order heavy damages which might be extremely serious to a small firm am i to understand that the government are not prepared to consider any way of meeting that point in the bill and that those damages which have actually been incurred by the breaking of a condition of the licence are not recoverable and the firm has no redress <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that the problem of verification and we all wish it well is particularly difficult in relation to chemical weapons once they are made <e> <s> i understand that there arc between and tonnes deployed fairly forward in the ussr <e> <s> can my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the picture that the noble lord <e> <s> lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> paints is one totally dissimilar to anything i saw in the ministry of defence at the time of this crisis <e> <s> would my noble friend also confirm in addition to what he has said very succinctly as to the one reason why the belgrano was sunk that every piece of advice to the prime minister from our military experts was that it did without question pose a threat to the task force and to british lives <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also congrat-ulate the noble lord lord beswick not just on introducing this interesting motion but on the way in which he introduced it which was worthy of this house and not so much reminiscent of the political to-and-fro that goes on in another place <e> <s> i shall try to keep very much to that same note in supporting my noble friend <e> <s> i do not know whether he needs my support but i looked at the list of speakers at lunchtime today and saw that no one was supporting him from the benches behind him so i put down my name which means that i shall set hansard an even greater puzzle than usual <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord has commented on a personal remark of mine may i say that i merely pointed out that the confidence of the stock exchange which is not generally misplaced is extremely high about the future of manufacturing industry which is what i invested in <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree following the supplementary question of the noble lord lord kennet that all independent studies and the nato study itself have shown that during the years concerned which are mentioned in this question the balance of the intermediate range nuclear warheads has swung very heavily in favour of the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords following my noble friends last answer does he not agree that had our share of world markets not fallen by more than half between and and had we been a little less uncompetitive in that period and our share had fallen to only say per cent <e> <s> of the world markets then <e>", "<cs> my lords time in these short debates makes restraint on the usual courtesies with which one would like to start ones contribution to this very important debate but let me briefly congratulate the noble and gallant lord lord cameron on the way that he has introduced this important debate and also let me say to him on behalf of the house how pleased we are to see him back in obviously good health again <e>", "<cs> my lords let me start today in contrast to yesterday by congratulating the government on their white paper <e> <s> i note in passing that it is perhaps because my noble friend the leader of the house is replying to the debate that the usual number of between and speakers to whom i found myself replying in recent years seems to have evaporated down to <e> <s> i wish that i had had a leader of the house prepared to answer these debates <e> <s> i am delighted that my noble friend has decided to reply although i commiserate with him and i look forward with great interest to hearing what he has to say on this vitally important subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to delay the debate by intervening and i thank the noble lord <e> <s> lord mayhew for letting me do so <e> <s> i said clearly and it is in all the governments open documents on the subject that one of the reasons for choosing trident was a consideration of the degree of defence against ballistic missiles by the end of the s <e> <s> nobody would say that any scientist or group of scientists or experts will necessarily get their estimate right but one of the reasons why the prolonging of polaris for instance is not an answer is the appreciation of the better defences better but not total <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene for a moment and ask the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran whether the time for the important and quite complicated negotiation of what intellectual property rights would be purchased ultimately by a private purchaser of some kind is not when there is a purchaser actually negotiating <e> <s> at that time there will be the third party involved her majestys government and the ministry of defence research establishments which are still to a large degree separate from the royal ordnance factories who in fact have invented many important inventions in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who was privileged to watch over the purchases in the recent falklands emergency i want to say again what i said at the time that the royal ordnance factories form only one part of the armaments industry though historically a very important part <e> <s> aircraft missiles and other armaments have been developed separately and are in private hands <e> <s> far more of the operations which here are carried out by the royal ordnance factories are in private hands in the united states <e> <s> i have no doubt that the minister will describe the background powers of the government in times of war or emergency in relation to private industry <e> <s> as the minister who was ultimately responsible during the falklands conflict may i say that all parts of the armaments industry performed equal miracles including the ordnance factories as well as the british aircraft corporation over the supply of harriers and spares missiles of every kind and torpedoes that had not even been accepted by the services but which were made available for the operation <e> <s> there were no problems over any form of equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will permit me to intervene one of my duties as the minister concerned was to act as <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that far from her majestys present administration causing the current levels of unemployment these were in fact caused in the years between and when we lost half our share of world markets and would have suffered appalling unemployment but for one fact that this was an era when the world economy the free worlds economy grew by double <e> <s> we ended up in the late seventies with half the share of world markets but the world markets were double <e> <s> would my noble friend agree that it was not until the recession came that the malaise caused in those years under both governments really came to light <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that in the end regrettable heavy extra <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may detain the house for one minute on this matter <e> <s> i think that we ought to be satisfied with the many assurances that the government have given about the objects of privatising the royal ordnance factories which i know to be entirely positive and which are entirely aimed at ensuring that the royal ordnance factories flourish as suppliers not only of her majestys forces in this country but as is necessary in todays market of the requirements of allies of her majestys government abroad <e> <s> i am quite and entirely satisfied that this has to be done in the private sector and that in addition to the many government assurances on the positive nature of their intentions in any privatisation that takes place there are natural controlling factors which ensure that the long-term interests of the government the royal ordnance factories themselves and the armed services are bound to coincide in making sure that positive and secure arrangements are made for the future wellbeing of this great organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may help my noble friend by asking him to confirm that the main loss in the share of the market for manufactured goods referred to by the noble lord lord kaldor took place between and when our share of world markets was halved and that this was because we were completely uncompetitive with the rest of the world <e> <s> will my noble friend also confirm once more that the only reason this did not show in massive linemployment under administrations prior to was that the period between and was one of phenomenal growth when the trade of the free world doubled which has never happened before and which will probably never happen again <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware she seems to be very well aware of a great many of the activities of this organisation that ex-general m h von meyenfeldt who i understand is presently chairman of this posse of generals wrote in the journal of the world peace council in october <e>", "<cs> my lords as a result of the intervention by the noble lord the leader of the opposition will my noble friend make it clear once again that if i understand the question on the order paper correctly it has nothing whatever to do with the redundancies recently announced and the question of employment in certain ordnance factories <e> <s> indeed will he confirm that the whole purpose of removing the inevitable constraints upon an organisation on a trading fund basis in the public sector is to enable that organisation to compete more effectively within the arms industry at home and abroad where although it has made some progress in export orders there is a lot that the quality of its products could still achieve and that the object of these arrangements <e>", "<cs> is therefore to increase employment and increase the success of this industry <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that previous ministers at the ministry of defence made a major mistake in quoting as one figure an amount for a or year programme to keep our independent nuclear deterrent up to date <e> <s> even then it is substantially less than the cost of the tornado <e> <s> would my noble friend further agree that our record in building submarines half the cost of the project has been good they have come through at estimate on all recent occasions <e> <s> would he further agree that the us cost of building missiles of this nature has also in the past come through at estimate <e> <s> would he further confirm <e>", "<cs> would he further confirm that the agreement has fixed as a fixed sum in dollars the r and d expenditure <e> <s> would he finally confirm <e>", "<cs> would he finally confirm that the french spend some four times what we do on maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that that part of lord jenkinss taxes or other taxpayers taxes which goes to maintain deterrence against potential aggressors probably does more and is more willingly paid by the mass of taxpayers than almost any other part of taxation and that those taxes to maintain deterrence are more likely to maintain peace in europe than are many of the noble lords questions <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that there are some aspects of verification which will continue to require on-site inspection for instance chemical weapons and chemical stocks which none of the new technology is capable of detecting <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that we should thank the almighty or the oil companies for the fact that north sea oil came on stream when it did when the country after two <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that this matter should be judged not only on the figures of increased exports to the united states of america but also by whether firms using a quite exceptional exchange rate have decided with the profits that they can make at the moment to invest in making new products in order to penetrate on a permanent basis <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord what is the base year for his statement that sterling has fallen more than european currencies <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening at little notice in this debate <e> <s> however having listened to the speeches with great interest i felt that there was perhaps room for another industrialist as opposed to a financier to make a point or two <e> <s> let me begin by saying that having spent my life in industry trading in many countries and between many countries i could not disagree with the pleas of the cbi to which the noble lord lord ezra has referred about the desirability of having greater stability <e> <s> that is real and it becomes very important when we have the type of fluctuations in the exchange rate that we have had since <e> <s> since that time we have had the fantastic rise in oil prices the scare as to whether there would be enough energy for the civilised world and then the situation where there was plenty of energy and so it is not surprising that we have had these very great and unusual fluctuations <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected <e> <s> indeed the thrust of my argumentation and i am sure their knowledge is that it can only perhaps be a help in the right direction <e> <s> when there is a great need and a great desire one is inclined to say lets do this or lets do that <e> <s> one must take with a grain of salt the degree of benefit that one is likely to obtain from that particular course of action which as i understand it is really the only positive line of action that has been suggested to us today <e> <s> i shall return in a moment to the other factors which have been suggested as responsible for major fluctuation <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say and i have not finished my remarks that oil was the entire reason <e> <s> i was also talking about a much longer time span that the last months <e> <s> my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne has already referred to the fall of other currencies against the dollar <e> <s> it entirely depends upon which point you wish to take as your baseline <e> <s> in my thoughts on oil i included the underestimation of the effect that oil had on the strengthening of sterling from our very weak competitive position in the real economy in the late s <e> <s> i would only add that the oil price and the trend of the oil price is the important factor that should be drawn to your lordships attention <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that perhaps the problem of the noble lord lord beswick is in not viewing this matter from the perception of a potential aggressor in or later perhaps because he is not an aggressive man and is a good democrat <e> <s> but would my noble friend agree that if one does look at it from the viewpoint of a potential aggressor it must be obvious to such an aggressor that his only hope of taking over another part of the world which might be his intention would be if nuclear weapons were not used <e> <s> finally does my noble friend agree that if it is clear that on that long-far-off day preferably more than one democratic defender is prepared to defend freedom with whatever weapons are necessary the tragic situation will never arise <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord home has performed another service of many services in a long lifetime of fairly selfless services and <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mayhew knows very well the difficulties of a government in stating their sources and estimates <e> <s> does the noble lord recall that since anyway to my certain knowledge having answered for the government on this question the estimates have been above tonnes of which a great deal is stored forward and have now risen to tonnes <e> <s> i think the estimates have been completely consistent <e> <s> the noble lord knows as well as most people how carefully those government estimates are prepared <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend an estimate of the degree to which the problems that are being complained about will be alleviated when the m is completed <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that while everybody has supported the strengthening of the supervisory department of the bank of england in his right honourable friends statement the key is the highest possible quality of people in the department and that probably that will not be achieved by simply strict rules of enforcement alone but more by the terms of reference being made wider and thus more interesting for high quality people following his remarks on secondments from private banks which i think bear on that <e> <s> will it be possible for the duties as they will become to be looked on as an extremely valuable training area for commercial banks secondments or for other people taking those jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord a forecast of the exchange rate over the next years <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may endorse all the comments made about the maiden speech of the noble lord lord crawshaw and express the hope that we shall hear many more speeches from him <e> <s> i was certainly one of those who supported the two-day debate thesis <e> <s> i am pleased now to be speaking on the nuts and bolts day <e> <s> it seems to me that the nuts and bolts should have slightly more bearing on strategy and policy than they often do <e> <s> my sympathy for my noble friend lord trefgarne even in answering half the number of speakers that we used to have in a whole days debate over the range of subjects already covered is extreme <e> <s> indeed this debate has underlined once again the many quite different and very important subjects that are encompassed in the defence area <e> <s> while it has been stressed twice already that we nearly lost the last two wars in the atlantic let me remind your lordships that we only just saved the last war in fighter command in <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that the reason why our record on training is worse than that of other countries is that we had a period of the best part of two decades prior to when the atmosphere for private industry was so unfavourable and the profits were so low that research and development and training were both reduced below the level of our competitors abroad <e> <s> will he further agree that there is a danger that if the government do too much in this now that conditions are different british industry will leave it to the government rather than efficiently increase its training itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been wondering why so many of us have had this extremely adverse reaction to the implementation of the top salaries review board report <e> <s> i think that all of us had the feeling which has been expressed by a number of noble lords of goodness <e> <s> at this moment with the teachers and all the rest <e> <s> then one began to ponder not only what has been said many times already whether there is ever a right moment but one began to ponder whether this over-reaction which i believe it to be is yet another manifestation of our failure to understand what was done to the economy and the british structure and the british public service heads throughout the s and s under all governments <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend any figures which indicate the rough return on capital of these public bodies over recent years <e> <s> these figures might put the matter a little more into perspective as i believe them to be of a fairly reasonable order <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first time that i have spoken on this subject in this house <e> <s> for a long while i have tried to maintain the image of being a very full-time industrialist or minister with no time for any recreation <e> <s> in fact i have over years fished more than rivers throughout the united kingdom <e> <s> whenever i have been able to get a spare moment be it at a weekend or during my annual holidays i have used nearly all of it as a fisherman <e> <s> i suppose that constitutes an interest <e> <s> certainly i am a member of various fishing syndicates that own stretches of water <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is he aware of the actual terms used by president reagan on th december namely to <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend

newly-industrialised countries continue to protect strongly or totally their own markets <e> <s> will he accept the need for a fair trading opportunity <e>", "<cs> internationally for our half-million-strong textile industry <e>", "<cs> i must disagree with my noble friend and support the two amendments to which we have been speaking amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i know that my noble friend lord kimball is familiar with every inch of the naver and the north coast of scotland but i am interested to learn that he has swum all round the coast following underwater the normal route of fish that have not been tagged <e> <s> there is evidence that the tagging and handling of fish alters their running habits <e> <s> there is also enormous evidence that the vast majority of fish almost insist on returning to their own river and to the tributary of it <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> while i <e>", "<cs> may i just say to the noble viscount that i respect entirely his great knowledge of his particular area and of fish generally <e> <s> however some of us are talking of estuaries which are miles long with brackish water and tides that move up and down where there is no question whatever but that fish stay in that miles and move up and down <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend answers that point may i observe that in so far as there may be an advantage in using only one transparent filament the advantage is almost the same as if one is using two <e> <s> that would be the easiest thing in the world to construct <e> <s> therefore i suggest that the point raised by my noble friend the marquess of lansdowne should be taken on board and a more comprehensive definition used <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and which are in my name and to amendment no <e> <s> which follows on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i fully supported at second reading the unanimous view that licensing should apply to england and wales <e> <s> because of the in-position water authorities it would be slightly easier in <e>", "<cs> before any amendment is pressed or withdrawn let me say that i shall be happy when it comes to my turn to withdraw my amendments in view of what my noble friend has said <e> <s> let me say two things <e> <s> first i share the view of the noble learned lord lord denning that it would be nice if the laws of england and scotland were the same but he must know considerably better than i do that they are not <e> <s> the proposal in the bill follows the civic government scotland act <e> <s> there are differences even within the fishery field in that individual netsmen and rodsmen in scotland do not have licences and in england they do <e> <s> we are not going to put that right in this bill <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend would allow me to intervene on this <e> <s> i deliberately did not answer the noble lord lord belstead on this question but in fact a legal scottish netsman has a title to be netting <e> <s> it is the easiest thing in the world to amend my amendment if it comes forward at report stage to say that a legal scottish netsman who can prove his legality can sell to a dealer in billingsgate <e>", "<cs> my noble friend should read a report which has been mentioned many times in this debate the report of the welsh water authority on illegal fishing in wales <e>", "<cs> while noble lords are thinking of their response to that suggestion perhaps i may ask my noble and learned friend whether this new clause will overrule clause of the salmon and freshwater fisheries act <e> <s> this effectively says in regard to any salmon including in the season that is after st august but also out of season <e>", "<cs> in which case i must ask my noble and learned friend why at some stage we cannot have something similar to the amendments moved by the noble and learned lord lord denning and the noble lord lord moran for the whole season rather than for part of it <e>", "<cs> with respect the words in possession i read out and they are in that provision <e>", "<cs> i should like strongly to support the amendment <e> <s> the tamar estuary which flows out through plymouth sound is a case in point <e> <s> there are virtually no white fish in the estuary but there are large numbers of theoretically sea-fishing nets working regularly <e> <s> the south west water authority has by agreement managed to effect a degree of control <e> <s> i am absolutely sure however that legal backing for its efforts to cover all forms of nets in the kind of conditions that the noble lord lord moran suggests would be very much welcomed by the authority and would reduce what has been a major source of illegal taking of salmon <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friend would never twist anything <e> <s> he is probably absolutely correct technically <e> <s> however i hope that he has taken on board that for certain purposes with certain exceptions including the kind of situation he mentioned that of housewives buying salmon this provision rather more draconian than the one i have suggested is in the salmon and freshwater fisheries act <e> <s> there are exceptions to it and i am quite sure that my amendment as put forward would not be technically sound without listing all the amendments made by this bill <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a brief word <e> <s> we have conflicting problems here <e> <s> the urgency which my noble friend lord lansdowne stressed is very great indeed <e> <s> at second reading i pointed out that the statistics are not necessarily related to the size of the stock and that there is a very strong thesis which suggests that if the catch now with all these modern nets about which we have been talking which my noble friend uses as well as the driftnetsman is down by half the stock is down a great deal further <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord moran makes clear what he wants to do i would ask my noble friend to consider before the next stage of the bill whether he cannot give any statement along the lines of that requested by the noble earl lord perth that it is the intention to phase out ultimately <e> <s> i feel that unless we do that our chances of bringing the irish under control my noble friend mentioned the irish problems let alone continuing to make progress on high seas netting overall will be very small <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend is prepared to consider the possibility of the government saying something further at report stage <e> <s> if he is not able to do so and if the noble lord lord moran were to get his wording correct on licences and re-table his amendment i would support it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for confirming that coming back at the next stage is a definite commitment and is not overtaken by the commitment that his noble friend and mine gave on the last occasion in relation to the drought review <e> <s> i was not in my own mind clear as to whether the drought review was to be the be-all and end-all with nothing before that or whether the ministers preparedness to take away the view of the committee and consider it for the next stage was equally important <e> <s> on the grounds that it is equally important which my noble friend has just mentioned i agree to withdraw the amendment tonight with the one remark <e> <s> i do not think either of my noble friends should put too much emphasis on two speeches out of i think probably about the last time we discussed this in relation to this matter <e> <s> there was utter unanimity except for two proprietors who own netting rights as well as fishing rights <e>", "<cs> i very much trust that with all the talk we have had on conservation in relation to england and wales in two committee days in a situation of probably a bigger crisis in salmon in england and wales even than there is in scotland we shall not have difficulty in getting some conservation measures in at the report stage which can only be done if there is a commitment to change the title also <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friends motion and congratulate her on all the study and work she has done for many years in this important area <e> <s> i do not believe that my noble friend ever meant or even said she has i believe made this clear that politics would not feature in education <e> <s> the word politicisation is possibly capable of being taken more than one way <e> <s> but i am quite sure that she and all those who have supported her regard the idea of no politics in education as a ninepin which has been put up and successfully demolished by certain noble lords opposite <e> <s> it is great fun knocking down ones own ninepins <e> <s> i am sure that we all accept that politics comes into education a little at early ages and more fully later <e> <s> there are politics and economic courses at a-level which i am sure we all regard as an important part of the syllabus <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it would be convenient to my noble friend on the front bench if we spoke to amendments nos <e> <s> and at the same time as amendment no <e>

amendment no <e> <s> or whether we can come back to it whichever is to the convenience of the house <e> <s> however i intend to move amendments nos <e> <s> and unless my noble friend can go a little further in reply to the very fair question put by my noble friend lord home <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say to the noble viscount lord thurso that if he looks at subsection he will find that anyone with legal authority to fish in scotland is allowed to do what he wants to do <e>", "<cs> my lords it is just for me to withdraw the amendment echoing <e>", "<cs> my lords it remains for me to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> the consultations with the water authorities are to be welcomed because they are very keen on this <e> <s> may i prey yet further on my noble friends patience to ask him if he has time if he can possibly keep those who have shown an interest in licensing apprised of what he plans to do at third reading <e> <s> secondly may i point out to him that the problem of the housewife with one or even two salmon for a party is one which i think can be specified and excluded successfully without breaking the chain <e>", "<cs> my lords on those terms i beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords again before the noble lord does so may i say that the statement that the government recognise that this practice could take place is an under-statement it does take place on a very large scale <e> <s> the fishermen themselves know they are fishing for salmon but they pretend they are fishing in estuaries or just off the edge of estuaries for white fish <e> <s> in the case of the tamar estuary they fish in places where there are known to be virtually no sea fish at all and they do it regularly <e> <s> so it is not a theoretical problem it is a problem which exists and i welcome what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for all that he said and will leave it to the consultations <e> <s> i have in fact told him what happens and that officers are without doubt put in the position of having to scratch their heads as to whether or not they should bring a charge <e> <s> we have been all through that <e> <s> if i may i should like to ask my noble friends officials to let me know which part of the act contains these seizure powers so that i can look at them before the consultations <e> <s> with that and pendings the consultations i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord moran decides what he wants to do with his amendment i would say to my noble friend not again all that has been said and to which he has replied with the governments arguments but that there is nothing in clause stating that the person has to be a reasonable person <e> <s> that just is not in the clause <e> <s> that is why i suggested in my amendment that a person might be expected to have reasonable grounds <e> <s> that wording has faults but nothing in the bill states that the constable making the arrest or the court needs to <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say i have read them <e> <s> they state that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend in his reply to this amendment which i support to answer three questions <e> <s> the first is this <e> <s> do the government have the power if necessary to ban for periods of years even totally drift netting without a further act of parliament <e> <s> secondly will he confirm that i am correct in saying that they and the district salmon boards combined and the water authorities have the power already to increase the weekly closed time to increase the slack period which might be a way of dealing with subsection of amendment no <e> <s> namely to make sure that the fish that are spared by the drift netters are not all caught by the estuary netters <e> <s> thirdly while the review is to take place in three years and i believe that he would probably accept that the machinery to take any action after the review might take a year or more for there have to be inquiries and the like can he confirm that if the situation warranted it the government together with the water authorities could act earlier than the three-year review if that proved absolutely necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord moran decides what he wants to do about this amendment and with the leave of the house may i say that i find what my noble friend said in relation to the powers of the government to act at the end of the three-year review and i will not go into the acting earlier question to be a bit at variance with the consultation he so kindly gave us in this respect where i think i had understood that it was possible indeed if the conservation really required it <e> <s> going through the steps including the necessity for inquiries and the like i understood that it was possible to agree on a ten-year ban should the situation and many of us have talked of the situation of salmon prove that necessary <e> <s> so i find his answer a bit at variance with what i thought we had been informed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that the main reason for british unemployment figures being higher than they otherwise might be today is the policies of governments thoughout the sixties and seventies which allowed us to become ever less competitive and that the steps the present government are taking are showing some signs of at last getting us back to creating real gains in our market share at home and abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must apologise to my noble friend lord ridley for withdrawing his amendment when he was absent during report stage and before anybody else had a chance to speak to it <e> <s> secondly let me quickly support his amendment now <e> <s> perhaps i may refer first to the remarks of the noble viscount who has just sat down <e> <s> as i have said before i have enormous admiration for his knowledge of salmon not only in thurso but all over <e> <s> i know that the noble viscount has travelled all over and has made a real subject of this matter <e> <s> however he would not claim to be a complete encyclopaedia about the movement of fish under the surface of the water where science has made a contribution but only a limited one at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i am in order and the noble and learned lord lord denning has asked me if i will speak generally on this subject and also to my amendments which could not be called if either amendment no <e> <s> stands or it came about that amendment no <e> <s> was amended by amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> at his request and for the convenience of the house it is perhaps best that we should debate all these matters now <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend the chief whip very much for keeping me in order <e> <s> i have pleasure in stealing the noble and learned lords fire by officially moving his amendment for him though i know that he will now speak to it and the others <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand having consulted the clerk that i have hijacked the right of the noble and learned lord lord denning to speak to what was originally his amendment as a result of his request that i should speak first <e> <s> i have inquired as to whether i can relinquish that right in his favour and am told that i cannot <e> <s> that being the case i should just like to make two very short points <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage someone ought to record our thanks to my noble friend lord belstead and to his colleagues involved in the bill for producing in record time a thorough description of the enabling powers that he plans to take <e> <s> i have only one very small point to raise relating to the very long debate we had on the need for a possessor of salmon to say where he obtained them <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i asked my noble friend whether the provision as he has tabled it will prevent it from including the need to buy from the holder of a licence to take as well as of a licence to deal <e> <s> if the answer is no it would not prevent him i can well understand that there are still many problems as to what is actually done <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that our thanks are again due to my noble friend lord belstead for bringing this measure forward into the bill <e> <s> i am sure it is a very useful extra provision in areas where there is a desire to reduce the number of legal nets in an estuary <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the amendment of my noble friend lord belstead <e> <s> i too as my noble friend lord lansdowne made clear regret that we have been unable to spell out clearly the need for a national policy for conservation against the background of all that was said on second reading about the degree to which our stocks have been reduced <e> <s> i believe that the government are a little frightened that if they use the phrase a national policy for conservation it follows and it would have followed as regards the amendment of my noble friend lord lansdowne that they must carry out a detailed review all the way around the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend care to consider that if the usual channels decide that we should have a debate on this matter he might have available some figures to show the degree to which foreign-owned multinational companies have increased employment in all areas including research and development compared with similar examples of british-owned companies <e> <s> certainly it is within my experience that this is not a set pattern one way or <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend have readily to mind the total tax per gallon that is paid in this country at present <e> <s> is it of the order of pence a gallon <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves the point about the exchange rate will he attribute no part of the influence of the very strong period of the pound to the scare as regards the world shortage of oil and our coming on-stream in full degree as an oil producer <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend be able to give us any rough estimate of what the government feel would be the necessary cost not only to the british defence budget but to all allies defence budgets in nato if we were to move to a situation where we could hold with conventional arms any assault from the east for more than a matter of days in fact indefinitely bearing in mind that their firepower in terms of tanks aircraft and the like is about two to one or more at the present time <e>", "<cs> i am known to support this amendment those later on secondary schools and amendment no <e> <s> on the right of parents to know what the curriculum involves <e> <s> the only word i want to add because i should simply be echoing rather inadequately the fine words that much more important people than i have already spoken is to go over the case for amendments along these lines <e> <s> i want to suggest that we must be careful about saying take the words away look at them and produce new words <e> <s> i expect that noble lords have taken their pens out already on the words that are before us and tried to scribble better ones <e> <s> in any particular form of words we have a real problem to produce them in a form in which they cannot be misread if someone wants to misread them <e> <s> that is an easy situation for those who do not want to do anything about this growing and serious situation to resist any amendment <e>", "<cs> since my noble friend referred to my remarks i would remind him that i suggested that the men of good will who are in a majority be given a peg which will help them to control the activities of the minority which are spreading <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend answers on this probing amendment may i say that i hope that on this occasion we shall not get another repeat of this is not the right way to cure the problem legislation is not required <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord harris has done the committee a great service by listing the number of schools which the police are forbidden to enter <e> <s> perhaps it is a common sense deduction to suggest that in the schools where the police are forbidden quite a lot of other distorted practice and persuasion is going on and quite a lot of the anti-police propaganda which my noble friend lady cox suggested is going on <e> <s> this is a problem <e> <s> all the problems that we have had in this section of the debate on the education bill are real problems and they are growing <e> <s> so i hope that we can have an end to the kind of statement which says either it is too difficult or legislation is not the right way to deal with it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend before my other noble friend presses or withdraws his amendment can give some idea of how long this process of consulting over the regulations will take and whether it will be possible while the bill is still in this house to get something slightly firmer than he has told us today <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a long discussion on this subject at committee and report stages <e> <s> it is true that the amendment can only now be looked at in detail but i think i am right in reminding the house that the bill goes from here after third reading to the other place and should there be amendments to this clause they can be discussed when they return to us <e> <s> i should have thought that we have had enough discussion of this important matter <e> <s> the view of the house has been made fairly clear and the motion moved by the noble lord lord shepherd should not be agreed to <e>", "<cs> are we not taking a rather long time on some not very necessary provisions <e> <s> i know that noble lords opposite do not approve of privatisation but if we are going into life histories perhaps i may say that i spent my working life in large private enterprises which have an investment as british gas has and will have of a size which makes market share only of interest over a five-year ten-year or fifteen-year span and which have kept research and development at a high level because they must <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me for one moment to say that my comments were on british gas <e> <s> it is a huge company which would have to be backed in the energy world by the city of london <e> <s> i am as aware as he is of its past history and of all the different arguments which can be advanced about lack of competitiveness and lack of research <e> <s> my comments applied to british gas in the energy industry <e> <s> it is a huge company which would have to be financed by the city and it would have to be long term <e>", "<cs> i endeavoured to say that in this industry at this time i use my unilever background i could not see any possible alternative for british gas which would have to take a long-term <e>", "<cs> in clause for instance and there are other phrases in clause it says quite clearly that a supplier <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend confirm one point <e> <s> if the director general wished to take advice from the consumers council before setting the tariff i imagine that there is nothing on earth to stop him <e> <s> in employing a director general we are employing somebody of considerable calibre <e> <s> there are obviously a mass of other matters besides the consumer viewpoint on the setting of the tariff initially but i imagine that there is nothing to stop a sensible director general consulting the consumers council before he fixes it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran prompts me to say that certainly in the years during which i had any experience it was not by any means always true that either service personnel or civil servants in the ministry of defence proved that their reliability in maintenance was greater than that of many of those who had actually made the equipment <e> <s> the minister has mentioned the number of contractors who have experience in this field <e>", "<cs> with great respect if the noble lord will read <e>", "<cs> may i briefly with two years experience of the royal ordnance factories working under a trading fund complicate the problem by saying that this is certainly not a perfect option <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning put his finger on the problems of the trading fund <e> <s> i certainly have experience that those problems existed in a changing age <e> <s> the safety wellbeing and future of the royal ordnance factories and of the equipment they supply and thus of the services the army in particular would not be safeguarded under the continuity of the trading fund operation <e>", "<cs> just before the committee comes to a decision let me say to the noble lords lord mulley and lord graham that at the end of my period the management of the rofs one and all were saying that there were restraints restraints on employment and on commercial activities of one kind and another <e> <s> i in no way meant to reflect adversely on the success of the rofs in selling british equipment in various parts of the world <e> <s> i can only plead to the noble lord lord mulley that in spite of trying quite hard i was unable to remove the dead hand of the civil service rules in relation to a trading fund and was unable to satisfy the management of the rofs and to give them the freedom which i believe that in the case of the dockyards the governments arrangements will do <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that while the change in industry is a major reason for the problems of this country and of many others in relation to unemployment there is another major contributory cause to the absolute level of british unemployment <e> <s> it is that this country lost more than half its share of world markets between and under governments of every party <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has answered the question i was going to ask which was the date at which the department had written to the inner london education authority <e> <s> in view of the fact that no reply has been received how much longer is my noble friend going to wait before taking further action <e> <s> would he not agree that his last but one answer was worthy of the very best of sir humphrey appleby <e>", "<cs> i certainly support the excellent white paper which is well written and well presented <e> <s> i regret as the noble and gallant lord lord hill-norton has said that we have not kept to the two-days debate system <e> <s> last year i chose the nuts and bolts day <e> <s> this year as there is only one i shall speak mainly on general policy <e> <s> but my lords allow me one comment on nuts and bolts in relation to the points which the noble and gallant lord lord hill-norton made in relation to the nimrod situation <e> <s> all that i want to say is not that he was wrong years ago but that the situation before the government today is whether having spent a very large amount of money on a very large amount of high technology we should not complete the job <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that while it may be possible to know where chemical weapons are manufactured at present they can be manufactured anywhere and that it is extremely hard for any outside means of detection to reveal where <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that times have changed when all the opposition parties want to make sure that we understand the importance of monetarism that in fact we have always taken into account other factors including the state of our own economy generally and that of america and that i hope that the government will continue to look at all these factors <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that the tank situation within the royal ordnance factories is a very specific one <e> <s> my noble friend said that he could not see from the mob point of view the possibility of keeping two major tank factories in operation <e> <s> is his advice as it certainly was to me a few years ago that there is very little chance of being able to sell enough tanks abroad in the export markets bearing in mind the extraordinarily cheap prices at which among others the ussr is prepared to sell tanks <e> <s> there is very little chance of building up exports in order to maintain two main tank factories <e> <s> will my noble friend further agree that the origins of this problem lie in regional policy supporting the establishment of the newcastle factory a good many years ago which increased the capacity without apparently any real rational reason for hoping that there would be sufficient markets for the two <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that while it is true to say that the near agreement at reykjavik got close to endorsing a longstanding proposal back in that we should adopt the zero option on medium-range missles since there have been major changes in other weapons which have to be taken into account <e> <s> the balance of tactical nuclear weapons due mainly to the withdrawal of american tactical nuclear weapons from europe has changed drastically and is today heavily in favour of the warsaw pact <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down did i understand him correctly in quoting the excellent publication of the international institute of strategic studies and in saying that the conventional balance shown in that study published last thursday does not show a very great balance in favour of the warsaw pact except as regards tanks <e> <s> i have the book open <e> <s> i shall not weary your lordships but would not the noble lord agree that on land and in the air almost every figure of importance in the conventional area is over two to one in favour of the warsaw pact <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the robust but necessarily brief statement on foreign affairs and defence in the gracious speech <e> <s> as many noble lords have already said these subjects have been much in the news lately through international meetings through the meeting of president reagan and mr gorbachev through party conferences and through many media programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not withdraw my remarks about the noble lords statement nor about the opinion poll which showed as a result mainly of the statements of leaders in this country the degree of confusion and misunderstanding that exists <e> <s> as this assessment by the institute one of the most important in my view that has been made has been raised so often during the debate i have to ask your lordships to bear with me for a moment while i deal with the actual figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like just to finish making this point <e> <s> the ratio in sam launchers is one to in armed helicopters one to <e> <s> when we come to aircraft the three main columns show ratios of one to one to and one to <e> <s> the aircraft figure shows the biggest difference compared with the ministry of defence estimates <e> <s> by any standard in what matters i shall come to men later it is a ratio of over to on land and in the air as an average <e>", "<cs> my lords the impression is entirely accurate <e> <s> the difference between the two years is marginal and described as marginal in the survey <e> <s> the trend since has been a build-up on the warsaw pact side in respect not only of items on land and in the air but also in respect of chemical weapons <e> <s> of these chemical weapons the international institute here i criticise it makes scant mention <e> <s> my noble friend the minister will perhaps refer to chemical weapons <e> <s> however we know that the figure has grown steadily to some tonnes probably in the main nerve agents quite apart from other pretty obnoxious substances <e> <s> we have almost nothing to put against them <e> <s> the other indirect effect of chemical weapons is to render the efficiency of our armed forces much more difficult because of the clothing that they have to wear at all times <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to know whether the noble lord and his colleagues do or do not accept that the international institute figures have never been seriously challenged and are approximately correct <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that one should not overstress the importance of individually declared moratoriums and that there are more convenient moments for some powers to declare a moratorium than others <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to be diverted by the usual scaremongering efforts of the noble lord lord jenkins <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend lord thorneycroft for introducing this interesting debate and in phrasing it in the terms which he has used <e> <s> in recent months and years there has been great concentration on arms control and in my view perhaps too little on the balance between that and defence and deterrence <e> <s> i believe that my noble friends motion has gone a long way towards putting that right <e> <s> i would accept that arms control is an object on its own <e> <s> if due to disarmament we could get a much lower level of arms which was verifiable and balanced and i point out to the noble lord lord jenkins that he did not quote the most important passage in lord mountbattens speech which stressed the need for balance then arms control would be a desirable object on its own <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that in addition to the reason that he has given for trident being only comparable with polaris at the turn of the century namely the build-up of the anti-ballistic defences there is also the important question of submarine vulnerability <e> <s> will he confirm that his painstaking scientists civilians and service experts are still advising that it is necesary to move to something with the range of trident by the mid-s if we are to keep a deterrent comparable in effectiveness to the one we have at the present time though nothing like five times as effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start my eight-minute contribution to this debate by saying that on all sides of the house we must be very excited about the changes that are taking place in the soviet union at the present time <e> <s> any remarks that i make today will certainly be conditioned by the fact of the efforts that are clearly being made by mr gorbachev and i think that all of us have to make sure that we discuss disarmament again and again in order not to discourage these exciting changes <e> <s> a cautionary word must be added however that not only since the revolution but before it the people of that great country have never had freedom as we understand it with the power that comes from freedom of expression <e> <s> one must watch with bated breath to see how far the changes go and one must realise that there are enormous differences still existing <e>", "<cs> development expenditure my lords <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble lord

truth of the matter is <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the truth of the matter as we shall see later <e> <s> sadly the bipartisan policy that existed all through the post-war years has now ceased to exist and the latest policy statement from the labour party which the noble lord lord mayhew mentioned toward the end of his speech entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords may i finish my sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords the finish of my sentence is that in my time in the ministry of defence no service chief or civilian quarrelled with the open documents on trident that we produced <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friends interpretation of what mr gorbachev said include his willingness to discuss the tactical nuclear weapons that the noble lord lord kennet mentioned where the balance currently due to allied withdrawals in the past five years is about eight or nine to one <e>", "<cs> sat first in parliament after the death of his father <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos for introducing todays debate on a subject which being as yet relatively broad in scope and imprecisely defined lessens the risk for me in my maiden speech of being corrected on points of detail on which noble lords knowledge will be considerably greater than my own <e> <s> it is with some trepidation and after overcoming not inconsiderable hesitancy that i address your
