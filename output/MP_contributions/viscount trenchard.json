["<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord lord airedale in which other act or acts he believes this phrase that an authority a director should receive representations is included <e> <s> i have just asked the gentlemen of great knowledge what the other acts are and they could not tell me of one <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord lord wallace of coslany what other acts he is referring to <e>", "<cs> i am sure it is not in any other acts my lords or at any rate my advisers cannot tell me of any and in view of that i would urge the noble lord not to divide the house on if i may say so a rather platitudinous statement that a director general should be open to representations when clearly he will be open to representations <e>", "<cs> my lords in deference to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos and to my noble friend lord godber of willington both of whom have been ministers of agriculture i want to say two things one that my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for agriculture and for trade have discussed this at great length and are happy with what we are putting before the house <e> <s> secondly we are not trying to undermine the act in any shape or form nor do i believe we will <e> <s> it is not a question of whether these boards are going to be referred it is a question of whether they could conceivably be in relation to an anticompetitive practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am informed not in relation to practices that the board might perform in relation to one customer or another and the effect that that might have between first point of sale first-hand trading wholesaler retailer beyond <e> <s> i am informed that the aspects which my noble friend covered very clearly the act does not fully cover <e> <s> we are talking about the very unlikely occurrence that there is a reference agreed by both secretaries of state in relation to aspects of this bill which are not covered in the act <e> <s> agriculture is being treated completely exceptionally in bringing in the need to consult in all the earlier clauses of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed very fully the question of price control both on second reading and in committee <e> <s> thus i shall be as brief as possible in reiterating only the main points that we made previously <e> <s> it is intended that investigations under clause should be purely fact-finding <e> <s> these amendments taken in conjunction with the proposed new clauses are totally <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord refers to quite another question the question of which minister in the other place would answer questions about price levels of particular commodities services or what-have-you where it has been decided that the minister whose department is responsible for that area should answer those questions <e>", "<cs> my lords again we have been over this ground before <e> <s> the power in this clause is not a replacement for the price control powers of the price commission legislation <e> <s> it is intended to be a fact-finding exercise to be used only in exceptional cases <e> <s> both these words major and significant would allow a myriad of small complaints to be made and they would not advance the situation of the level of prices <e> <s> we really have to divide the question of the level of prices and the events that are responsible for it and the effect of price control upon it <e> <s> we have been through that on many occasions <e> <s> i recognise that prices are an emotive subject and i realise that during the time which lasted for many long years when this government and the previous government appealed for adherence to an incomes policy as such it was argued that as a <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will only say that i believe that this clause can be used in a question of major public concern into prices of great significance and that is what it is intended for <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> nobody is going either to legislate or achieve a situation where the british public will not complain <e> <s> i am quite sure that they will complain <e> <s> what we are talking about is the secretary of states initiative to use the powers under clause and he does not envisage using those powers except in the circumstances prescribed in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take the noble lords statements as being supplementaries yes we do know that labour relations in the textile industry are on the whole very good indeed and that productivity is high <e> <s> the industry does however need and recognises this need to adjust to change all the time <e> <s> the mfa does afford a major measure of protection and the government are in no doubt that orderly marketing arrangements must continue after the end of the present mfa <e> <s> i do not think that the cost of energy is a major point in the companys decision <e>", "<cs> my lords one realises of course that there are fallout effects on dependent industries as the result of any loss of jobs <e> <s> the unemployment picture in bolton is at the moment almost exactly on the national average figures and in the areas concerned of all these four mills is unlikely to deviate far from the national average after these closures <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are determined to do everything within their power to provide a fair trading opportunity within our commitment to and interest in helping to maintain a relatively open world trading system <e> <s> that is essential for our export interests <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have been looking and will continue to look at the question of government purchasing in the context of giving british industry a fair trading opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the figure he quotes is approximately correct <e> <s> as high as has been mentioned as the cost to the average family over the period <e> <s> the productivity statistics which my noble friend quoted are perhaps those compared with the most efficient countries like japan and the usabut the productivity is nowhere near in line with major european countries either <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the question of the noble baroness lady gaitskell i think that my right honourable friend in the other place and i in this place have on many occasions since the unfortunate strike took place not only asked that the whole house should support the earliest possible end to the strike but have pointed out that if we had extra money which we could raise from the taxpayer for this purpose or if we felt it desirable to siphon it from other more desirable purposes it would not be a kindness to the average worker in the british steel corporation <e> <s> in view of the equipment which they now have it is an absolute necessity for the continued employment of those who remain in british steel that the industry becomes competitive without delay rather than avoiding the issue any longer <e>", "<cs> my lords i have up to date information on the subject <e> <s> i would remind the house that on th february i gave details of the very large amounts of money under all the european schemes which this country has obtained to help alleviate the problems of steel closures <e> <s> there is a proposed possible new scheme which would come under new social measures from the social fund which might provide in the first year of operation million <e> <s> my right honourable friend and co-minister was in brussels yesterday to explore the degree to which that extra money would be forthcoming and would be able to help in the re-adaptation and the measures necessary to try to soften the blow of the loss of steel jobs <e> <s> it is not money which can in any way help as regards the british steel corporations finances and what it can afford in its pay offer <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if we had moved more determinately sooner in accordance with the targets set by the secretary of state for industry in the previous administration it is indeed possible that our share of a depressed world market for steel products might be higher by now and more jobs might be able to be retained <e>", "<cs> my lords that is absolutely correct and i hope that both the size of the figures and the purpose of the fund which has been much reported in the media will make clear that the noble lord is completely correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the subsidies for coking coal in european countries has been well examined and i have explained it in this house on a previous occasion <e> <s> those subsidies do not in any way remove the overall truth that we are simply not competitive and that that is the major reason for the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the detailed figures for which my noble friend has asked but i shall let him have them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked precisely the same question on a previous occasion and i shall give him as far as i can remember it precisely the same answer <e> <s> there is no question but that an improvement in productivity one must say an overdue <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have been consistently firm about the figures concerned and for the cash limit of million which includes both capital and redundancy payments will be used for those purposes and for no others <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord assumes that the cost of the present strike which is undoubtedly bound to be very real at the moment to the british steel corporation will be borne by the taxpayers <e> <s> it is the governments view that the extra costs of the strike at the current time will merely result in a need for british steel to take the same actions as any other private corporation and to ensure that the extra costs are met by a reduction of stocks by if necessary disposal of assets and i hope not but if necessary by the loss of even more <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend is referring to the special ships for car transportation it was reported in the press that british shipbuilders had referred the order to the japanese <e> <s> that is not quite either the whole story or a fair story <e> <s> as i understand it from british shipbuilders this was one of approximately inquiries that they receive every year <e> <s> it was a rather tentative inquiry at that stage as are so many such inquiries <e> <s> british shipbuilders respond positively to about such inquiries <e> <s> i think that the answer to my noble friends original question is not to any major extent influenced by her supplementary question <e> <s> the original question relates to the stage in the restructuring programme which we announced on rd july and the progress made in that restructuring programme in order to reach a position where privatisation of the mainline activities becomes practical <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord any assurance about the idea of privatising as a whole rather than in parts <e> <s> indeed we have encouraged british shipbuilders to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that compensation is a separate question from the question on the order paper <e> <s> however the position on compensation is that since a declaration as long ago as was made on the principles of compensation that went into the act we have a situation where some cases for compensation have been settled in accordance with that act others have not and where share dealings have continued for some five years since the original declaration on a basis of the provisions of the act <e> <s> so there are very real complexities regarding going back in any way on the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the noble lord in full except to say that in the middle of the immense restructuring programme which we announced in july which has been agreed with both sides of the industry which involves a reduction from people to a little under people that is going to be a slightly higher reduction by agreement with the trade unions in relation to the latest wage settlement with order books in still running at only a little over half the target agreed between british shipbuilders and the last administration and endorsed by <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not necessarily or fully agree with the noble lord lord brooks of tremorfa <e> <s> it is more than possible when the restructuring programme is complete with a loss-making activity which nevertheless has the possibility of being turned by a private enterprise interest with knowledge of that particular activity that it might well make inquiries and take it over before profit is made <e>"]
