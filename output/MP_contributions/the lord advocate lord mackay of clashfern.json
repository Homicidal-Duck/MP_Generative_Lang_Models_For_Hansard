a report that some further allegations were being investigated and that a team of police officers had been appointed for this task <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said we had a fairly full debate on this clause in committee and in fact the committee divided on the question whether this clause should stand part of the bill before it decided to retain it in tit bill <e> <s> i accept of course that the valuation lists provide the tax base for the local authorities <e> <s> i also accept that the longer the time between one revaluation and the next the more there is risk of anomaly growing up but

the discussion at paragraph of the report <e> <s> it was not of course drafted as an act of parliament by parliamentary counsel and as such it was not intended to provide a comprehensive legislative formula <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this clause is a very limited one namely to deal with the mischief which was identified as a result of the decision in the divisional court in the <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships know i have indicated on earlier occasions that the attitude of her majestys government is very strongly in favour of the promotion of human rights but as the noble lord lord

situation is if possible to attain a fairly large measure of agreement <e> <s> that would be a matter which would be expected to be attained under the machinery of first of all talks between the major interests concerned and then the promotion of a measure with detailed consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said the amendment was discussed in committee and my noble and learned friend undertook to consider it in the words to which the noble lord lord mishcon referred <e> <s> our view is that the word legitimate was intended to convey in the phillimore recommendation an important idea and that in the context of this legislation that idea is accurately reflected in the phrase in good faith which we have chosen <e>", "<cs> as has already been anticipated the purpose of clause of the bill and the relative first schedule is to implement the fourth directive on company law of the eec <e> <s> that directive was negotiated on behalf of the united kingdom by the last administration

directive the attitude that the present government have taken is to make maximum use speaking generally of the exemptions in order to make as flexible as possible the rgime which is being introduced here <e> <s> this has <e>", "<cs> we can see the merit of this amendment which the noble lord has proposed and we should like to consider it further <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord selkirk has said this is a proposal for the alteration of section which as he has mentioned has been put forward by the law society of scotland and with considerable support <e> <s> the government are well aware of the concern which <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for introducing this matter and for referring to the meeting which he and the noble lord lord seebohm attended at the department last week and perhaps i should mention that the size of the team to which he referred is an illustration of the importance we attach to the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very content to take this amendment with amendments to and i am also content to look at the matter as one of principle and not examine the details of the amendment that the noble lord has proposed and rather to approach the questions by giving the background to the government proposals and our attitude so far as we have gone <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of my right honourable friend the secretary of state was in contact with the sheriffs principal well in advance of the strike <e> <s> general guidance was issued to all courts on nd march and a meeting with senior court staff

point to draw to the attention of the house <e> <s> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> we have had a fairly full discussion of matters which have perhaps not been entirely covered by the first amendment which the noble baroness lady stedman moved <e> <s> it might be useful if i explained that in our understanding the purpose of the existing totting up system and the way in which we are now seeking to improve it is to discourage repeat offences <e> <s> in other words the emphasis is on acting as a deterrent as my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls pointed out <e> <s> if an offence or a group of offences committed on the same occasion are not serious enough to result in immediate disqualification then the licence is endorsed as a warning <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this was a government amendment in another place <e> <s> it ensures that the only penalty for juveniles who commit contempt in the face of a magistrates court is a fine <e> <s> magistrates courts including juvenile courts have at present no powers to punish for contempt and the government take the view that a power to fine is adequate to deal with children aged and under who misbehave in court <e>", "<cs> the substance of the matter that has been raised by my noble friends amendment is the question whether the phrase british citizen where it occurs in clause includes british citizens by birth descent adoption naturalisation or registration <e> <s> to that question of substance the answer is clearly yes <e> <s> the phrase british citizen as it is used in the second line of the bill includes british citizens by all methods by which it is possible to become a british citizen under the bill and i am greatly indebted to my noble friend for giving an opportunity for me to say that as clearly as i can <e> <s> it follows that the differences between the various ways in which one can attain british citizenship are of no importance so far as the citizenship of a child born to that person in the united kingdom itself is concerned <e>", "<cs> in the nature of things any bill which attempts to deal comprehensively with the subject of british nationality is bound not to be readily understood at a cursory first reading <e> <s> the subject is necessarily a complicated one and obviously a great number of related questions have to be considered at the same time <e> <s> it is my hope and i am sure the hope of the government that the discussions which the committee have had and will have will help to make the bill even clearer than it is at the present time <e> <s> of course the government will pay very close attention to all that is said here and if that is what the noble lord lord mishcon means by taking the bill back then of course i readily undertake to do so <e>", "<cs> i have sought to learn here from the wiser and more experienced and your lordships will have heard my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter advising those in the position of my noble friend and myself that it would help us to give well-timed and occasional concessions <e> <s> i hope that this is a good time for a concession though <e> <s> i fear that the concessions in the committee stage at least as regards the first part of it may be rather occasional <e>", "<cs> as has been very fully explained already the purpose of this bill is to develop a reasonable and rational system of british citizenship <e> <s> it is our view that in that reasonable and rational system the provisions of consular registration have no place depending as they do first of all on transmission only through the male line and secondly only in countries other than the commonwealth <e> <s> so these two features of the present consular registration system seem to us basically unfair and possibly irrational <e> <s> if one is going to go over to a rational system it seems to be necessary to phase out at least the irrational elements in the present system <e> <s> that is what this bill seeks to do <e>", "<cs> this amendment which the noble lord lord avebury has moved seeks to add as he has explained a new clause to enable those british overseas citizens who hold that citizenship otherwise than by descent to transmit their citizenship for a further generation <e> <s> the amendment does not define what is meant by british overseas citizenship otherwise than by descent and it is not entirely easy to do that <e> <s> but leaving that difficulty aside <e> <s> i am afraid that the government see grave difficulties in accepting the principle of this amendment <e> <s> it would be contrary to the governments aim in this bill to allow british overseas citizenship which is essential a residual status intended for those citizens of the united kingdom and colonies who have no close ties either with the united kingdom or an existing dependency to be transmitted further <e> <s> this could only perpetuate the existing situation whereby our citizenship or in this case one of our citizenships is held by those who have only tenuous ties with this country or with an existing dependency <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee will be grateful to my noble friend for the spirit in which he addressed himself to this matter and the atmosphere which he has sought to continue from that which prevailed on the supreme court bill <e> <s> may i first of all try to answer the two specific questions that he raised at the beginning <e> <s> apart from the omission which he himself has noticed i think that his clause covers all the provisions in the bill which he would have intended it to cover <e> <s> so far as the immigration act amendment is concerned which is contained in clause of this bill our view is that that has made amendments on provisions of the immigration act but the amendments are inserted into the immigration act and accordingly the provisions relating to appeals and so on in the act are not interfered with by that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the noble lord lord melchett will in due course answer that question <e> <s> so far as i am concerned the situation is that after this amendment was passed in your lordships house the matter was put to the law officers including myself and we took the view that the word urgently in this context was inappropriate from the legal point of view <e> <s> of course once you put it into one place then differences in language are normally held to imply particularly when they occur in the same bill or act differences in sense and you tend to weaken the use of the word where it appears in other places in that legislation without the same word in front of it <e> <s> apart from that in the context of this particular clause the word urgently does not seem to be appropriate and i did not understand the noble lord in reading from his legal advice to suggest that it was but rather to suggest that the new phrase which he proposes is an improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all on behalf of her majestys government i should like to thank the noble lord lord wolfenden very much indeed for introducing this debate to us and for the manner in which he has done it <e> <s> i should also like to join with all the others who have thanked sub-committee c for their careful wideranging and even-handed consideration of the many issues which arise from the document which is the subject of this report <e> <s> i should also like to join with lord wolfenden in thanking those whom he thanked at the beginning of his speech for the work they did which enabled the sub-committee to do for us the work that it has done for us <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by conveying most cordial thanks on behalf of her majestys government to the noble and learned lord lord scarman who in the midst of a great variety of other burdens has come today to present this report to the house and of course for the work which he did himself in connection with its preparation <e> <s> i should also like to thank most cordially all those members of your lordships house who took part in the deliberations of the committee and all those who assisted in the way that the noble and learned lord lord scarman described <e> <s> it is right that i should also especially endorse what the noble and learned lord had to say about sir charles sopwith who in the course of a long and very distinguished career in the public service has put us all in his debt to an extent which it is really quite impossible to quantify <e> <s> i should also like to thank your lordships who have taken part in this debate today <e> <s> the comments which your lordships have made will certainly be taken into account in some of what i am going to say and perhaps more important in what is to follow from that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it may be for your lordships convenience if we take so far as possible groups of amendments together which have the same subject matter and i would propose along <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be considered forthwith <e>", "<cs> my lords i would first of all propose to say just a little more about the considerations which have led us in scotland to decide that this opportunity should be taken to reformulate and codify on the basis of the rules of jurisdiction contained in the convention our own domestic rules of jurisdiction and then to attempt to answer the questions that have been raised by the noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> before i turn to do that i should like to say how grateful we are for the welcome that your lordships have given to the bill and perhaps i should particularly congratulate the noble lord lord foot on succeeding in introducing some merriment into the proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords the sex discrimination act has now been in force for about five years <e> <s> i believe we can say that it has had an important impact in eliminating a great deal of blatant discrimination and in providing a framework

individuals employers and trade unions as well as government all have a part to play in making equality of opportunity a reality and in opposing unlawful discrimination wherever it is found <e>",

comprehensive and very helpful report <e> <s> in particular i should like to join in thanking the chairman of the sub-committee which produced the report and the noble and learned lord lord scarman who also introduced it to your lordships house with such characteristic clarity in opening the debate today <e> <s> i must say that i for my part was not able to detect any amount of timidity in that introduction <e> <s> in addition to the noble and learned lord himself i should also like to mention all of your lordships who participated in the work of the sub-committee and all of those who gave evidence before the sub-committee <e> <s> like the noble and learned lord i feel sure that your lordships would wish to express our appreciation to them because the quality of this is to a considerable extent assisted by the quality of the evidence which they were prepared to give and to come some distance to give and to give with a great deal of expertise as well as courtesy <e>", "<cs> it has been explained that the purpose of this amendment is to probe the governments proposals in this area and therefore i shall not say anything particular about the figure of million which has been selected for the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to do three things and i should like to comment on each of these in turn <e> <s> first the amendment would require the secretary of state to impose conditions in every consent for the supply of gas under the new section of the gas act which is set out in clause of the bill <e> <s> the secretary of state would not be able to give an unconditional consent in any circumstances <e> <s> i suggest it is pretty obvious that this must be a rather arbitrary and indeed rather meaningless requirement because all one would have to do to meet it would be to make a condition which was not in any way necessary <e> <s> there may be cases <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the qualification of being a simple scot is one which necessarily all of us would accept as applying to the noble lord but i think that perhaps he is not sufficiently taking account of the possibility that more than one person might make a requirement <e> <s> let us assume that the gas corporation has in mind constructing a pipe capable of carrying say two units it could be millions of therms and two other people knowing that the pipe has been proposed say that they have a requirement for a unit each <e> <s> the secretary of state therefore thinks that it would be a good idea to have a pipe that would carry four units over the stretch but he says to each of the two private people it will be necessary for you to pay a certain sum by a certain date before the unit which is your representation will be put in <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord beswick has said we discussed this particular amendment fairly <e>", "<cs> i think there are three matters with which i would wish to deal in seeking to state the governments position in relation to this amendment <e> <s> first the noble and learned lord lord wilson in introducing his amendment pointed out that on two earlier occasions the two law commissions had worked together <e> <s> when it came to the stage which gave rise to the report on which part i of this bill is founded the law commission made it perfectly plain that in their view the development of the law in the two countries in this particular area had been different and therefore it was not appropriate to engage in a joint examination of the law at that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to i will also speak on the same basis as did my noble and <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are content with the drafting of this amendment as with the drafting of the other amendments that the noble lord will propose at this report stage <e> <s> as your lordships know the government are neutral on the principle of the bill <e> <s> therefore i have nothing to add to that <e>", "<cs> the answer to the noble lords question is that the government saw it wise to make provisions in relation to the problem of which clause is concerned on the lines to which he has referred <e> <s> on the other hand in this clause we are not affecting basically the liability which trade unions had under the provisions of the act although we are affecting the people who can raise questions about it <e> <s> in that situation it does not seem wise to the government as we are presently advised to make these special provisions which are appropriate for the context of clause in the context of this particular clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to compliment the noble lord on the accuracy of his forecast in one respect but one respect only <e> <s> regarding the argument that he has advanced having attended to it as closely as i can i consider that the amendment still seems to me to be unnecessary and potentially confusing <e> <s> the amendment seeks to provide that a union cannot be found liable for compensation as a result of having been joined in an unfair dismissal case unless the pressure or some part of the pressure which has been exerted on the employer has been exerted on behalf of the union <e> <s> the point is surely a simple one whether one includes such words or not there can be no question of a union becoming liable for something not done on its behalf <e>", "<cs> my lords in discussing these amendments it is important that we should keep in mind the purposes of clause which was added to the bill at committee stage as your lordships have just been hearing <e> <s> it is particularly important to do that and to remind your lordships of what clause is about when it is suggested that in some way the fair wages resolution of the house of commons is relevant to this debate <e> <s> clause is designed to prevent companies from imposing upon contractors requirements that they should recognise and negotiate with or consult trade unions or trade union officials <e> <s> it is designed to protect non-union firms and their employees from having unions and union membership forced upon them from outside by commercial pressure <e> <s> this does not mean that we are opposed to employers recognising trade unions or are seeking to prevent them from doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the substantive amendment that we are discussing at the present moment is amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is the one which has been formally moved with nos <e> <s> and being connected with it no <e> <s> being the substantive amendment <e> <s> these amendments are designed as the noble lord lord wedderburn explained in moving them to reopen issues which have already been debated to some extent at committee stage and at some length on report <e> <s> before i turn to the detail of the amendments and of the arguments which have been used in connection with them i think that particularly in view of what the noble lord lord molloy has said and perhaps also to some extent in view of what the noble lord lord davies of leek has said it would be useful to say just a word or two about why clause is part of the bill at all <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be kind enough to say what the meaning of the word so is in his amendment <e> <s> the amendment reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment removes any risk of an action under clause being incompetent because a relative declined payment for services rendered to the injured person in the belief that such a payment would financially embarrass the injured person <e> <s> in effect it allows the relative the chance to change his or her mind when it is explained that an action for damages is intended and the responsible person will eventually meet the sum equivalent to payment for services to the injured person <e> <s> the amendment therefore avoids a potential difficulty for such a relative <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have considered this question <e> <s> as a result we consider that such a practice would not result in substantial improvements in administration and cost <e> <s> however for the past three years procurators fiscal have been under instruction to make available on request to defence solicitors statements of witnesses whose evidence is regarded as formal or technical and to discuss the evidence available to the crown <e>", "<cs> my lords while i have made it clear to newspaper editors and others that i am always willing to discuss the subject of what may properly be published in relation to cases being investigated or prosecuted i do not consider it appropriate that i should issue guidance to newspaper publishers on the subject of contempt proceedings arising out of the publication of a photograph of an accused <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first say how grateful we are to my noble friends lord onslow and lord renton for giving us this opportunity to discuss such an important subject and one which has occasioned a great deal of public concern <e> <s> reference has already been made to the incident which so dramatically focused public attention and concern on this area of the law <e> <s> an immediate consequence of the incident was that steps were taken to tighten up security <e> <s> i hardly need add that my right honourable friend the home secretary is continuing to keep a very close watch on the operation of security measures to protect the royal family <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness has explained the effect of the amendment would be to remove the first subsection of the proposed section b and hence to disapply the secretary of states proposed power of direction in so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to consolidate certain enactments relating to foster children as they have effect in scotland <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> it consolidates certain enactments relating to foster children in scotland <e> <s> it is pure consolidation and is intended to make no change in the existing law <e> <s> if your lordships approve it will be referred to the joint committee on consolidation bills which will consider it and make its report to the house in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a pure consolidation measure of the mental health legislation for scotland <e> <s> if your lordships approve it will be referred to the joint committee in the usual way <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord towards the end of his remarks succinctly explained his amendment as a wrecking amendment <e> <s> i propose to deal with the amendment rather than with the remarks that preceded that particular comment because indeed it is a wrecking amendment <e> <s> that is its only purpose <e> <s> if the house has <e>", "<cs> i think it might be convenient to take lord bruces amendment first and then look at the amendment proposed by my noble friend <e> <s> first of all may i say in answer to the point made by the noble lord lord somers that of course the structure of clause shows that this matter of competition is one matter to be taken into account along with others <e> <s> we have had a fair discussion in relation to clause <e>", "<cs> this amendment is intended to introduce wider <e>", "<cs> the noble lord who moved this amendment referred us to the earlier occasion when a very similar amendment was debated and when his noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones moved the corresponding amendment <e> <s> the argument is very much the same now as it was then subject to the fact that as the noble lord lord mishcon said only yesterday the european court of human rights were hearing the oral submissions arising out of the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on re-commitment on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran moved an amendment with much the same intention at the committee stage <e> <s> i think that the noble lord has decided to move his point of attack to slightly later in the bill from where he previously attacked <e> <s> i am sure that i could refresh the noble lords memory in that regard if he wishes me to do so <e> <s> of course i have no difficulty in agreeing with the sentiments which lie behind the amendment since as i explained in answering the noble lords amendment at the committee stage they fully reflect the governments policy one of the objectives of which is to keep united kingdom telecommunications at the forefront of technological developments <e> <s> we want to encourage both research and development and most importantly the application of the fruits of research and development to both new services and new products and also to new ways of providing existing services and products <e> <s> that is what the present drafting achieves because it refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord morris <e> <s> that is our objection to the first amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the object of all the provisions with which this part of the bill is dealing is to provide a minimum standard of protection and it would seem unwise to provide unnecessarily for a restriction of the information which could be put into the notice <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg leave to introduce a bill to consoli-date in relation to scotland certain enactments relating to rents and tenants rights and connected matters <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to have the opportunity to make evident the governments support for the bill in this house <e> <s> as has already been stated by my noble friend lord selkirk the purpose of it is to abolish a number of obsolete and discriminatory rules and actions in scots law <e> <s> while some of these rules may have had a useful function in the middle of the th century it is evident that they are at variance with the very different legal and social position of married women today <e> <s> some of the rules reflect outdated assumptions about the personal responsibilities of married women and their capacity to act on their own behalf notions which in this day and age may be regarded not only as archaic but also as objectionable and discriminatory <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside said the scottish law commissions proposals for reform are based not only upon its own thorough study of this area but also upon consultations which indicated almost unanimous support for its recommendations <e> <s> i have therefore no reservation in recommending to the members of your lordships house that they should support this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft european assembly constituencies scotland order which was laid before this house on nd march be approved <e> <s> with the leave of the house i propose to speak also to the draft orders for england and for wales which were laid before the house on th march and th march respectively <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments to certain of the lords amendments and commons amendments in lieu of a lords amendment be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend in opening the debate today and my right honourable friend the secretary of state in another place have made it very plain that the purpose of this bill can be described very briefly <e> <s> it is to help ratepayers both business and commercial ratepayers on the one hand on whose financial stability our nation depends and individual ratepayers on the other hand who have seen significant increases in their rates over recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on recommitment on this bill <e>", "<cs> the duties of the scottish valuation advisory council which was constituted in terms of section of the act to which the noble lord lord ross of marnock has made reference include advising the secretary of state on any matter relating to valuation which he may refer to them <e> <s> they therefore have a broadly based remit <e> <s> in my right honourable friend the secretary of state asked the council to consider the problem of valuation anomalies alleged to exist between the scottish valuation system and that of england and wales and matters of the kind to which the noble lord lord ross of marnock referred in connection with football grounds racecourses and the like were the subject of representations <e> <s> the whole subject matter had been referred to the scottish valuation advisory council already <e> <s> the review was completed early in and it considered the very basis of valuation in scotland <e>"]
