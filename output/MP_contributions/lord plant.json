service were offered per cent <e> <s> the pru was destroyed and arbitration denied <e> <s> that is what makes the difference <e> <s> it leads me to underline what was said by my noble friend lord

reasonably straightforward for the police to follow <e> <s> i think we are making things a little more difficult and confusing <e> <s> if i believe that seven days is right i cannot agree to hours <e> <s> admittedly one can extend the period of hours <e> <s> if we can extend it <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord the minister agree that over the country as a whole the post office are giving us an excellent service <e> <s> would not the workers in the post office be deserving of more helpful and constructive criticism from your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat bewildered at the moment <e> <s> there are a number of amendments down to these two clauses <e> <s> i am not clear whether we are now taking clauses and <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord the minister can help me <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that help <e> <s> i also have down an amendment to clause but i will deal now with the subject which the minister has just raised that is my amendments nos <e> <s> and as amendments to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat satisfied with what the minister has said <e> <s> i want to make this part of the bill as efficient as possible <e> <s> i do not wish to see chief police officers using probationers on this type of work <e> <s> i hope that the government will look at this problem <e> <s> i do not want unnecessarily to increase the sergeants complement hut i do want to urge on <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that intervention <e> <s> i will very carefully read what the noble lord the minister said <e> <s> i am sure that this is an issue which will be discussed on the police negotiating board or the advisory board because i do not believe that the police service will be satisfied with some of the difficulties that certainly will arise with the police stations that are designated <e>", "<cs> yes with this amendment i am speaking also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> clearly i am on a sticky wicket and so i shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i was not aware that i supported the government on this one <e> <s> otherwise it destroys my case <e> <s> i had almost finished and i want to get this on the record because it is a very important clause for the police <e> <s> we have tied one hand behind their back and i do not think that we ought to tie two <e>", "<cs> yes i am speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord lord hooson inform the committee what he means by in the presence of a solicitor <e> <s> he does not say in the presence of his solicitor <e> <s> does he have in mind that it will be a resident police station solicitor <e>", "<cs> yes i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does not convince me in the slightest <e> <s> he has made a long speech containing some statements which i should like to contest at some length but at this hour i do not propose to do so <e> <s> the noble lord said that doctors do not wish to do this distasteful investigation <e> <s> i accept that but doctors are servants of the state <e> <s> if we in parliament write this into the bill they must undertake this duty if we so direct <e> <s> why should the police have to do it <e> <s> they have had to do it up to now and they do not like it <e>", "<cs> i can only say that the information i get is that there are plenty of doctors prepared to help the police in this direction <e> <s> the bma does not represent all doctors <e>", "<cs> i am advised by the three police trade unions that they have sufficient information from the doctors that they would be prepared to undertake this duty <e> <s> they have not talked about this to midwives which of course is something different <e> <s> i still maintain that people who are employed by the state have to do rather difficult things <e>", "<cs> i would not want to press this committee to a division <e> <s> i would hate to see the government defeated at this early hour of the morning <e> <s> therefore i give the opportunity to the government front bench perhaps to ponder on what has been said from both sides of the committee on this issue and perhaps to come back at a later stage and we might also discuss it in the interim period <e>", "<cs> i greatly regret that the noble lord lord renton cannot go along with me because he feels that there may be some lack of skill in the drafting of the amendments <e> <s> all i can say is that i have been advised by eminent barristers that these two amendments are acceptable <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister <e> <s> that is helpful in one way but not in another <e> <s> however i feel that this is such an important issue for the police that i ought to divide the house on it <e>", "<cs> this amendment has already been dealt with <e>", "<cs> prisoners <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed at the attitude taken by the noble lord lord elton <e> <s> of course the police federation will back its members <e> <s> there is no question about that at all <e> <s> it has fought for a long time to get legal representation and the government conceded this in another place <e> <s> they would not concede the payment of legal expenses <e> <s> now in the final court we are making a further appeal to the government <e>", "<cs> that is splitting hairs <e> <s> all that i can say is that the policeman who is pounding the pavement will think that you are leaning towards the chief constable and not to the man in the lower ranks <e> <s> i do not want to divide the house <e> <s> yet i can see that if the noble lord is let off the hook at pm he will recover his composure tomorrow and be just as difficult at report stage <e> <s> i think therefore that i must ask the committee to vote on this <e>", "<cs> i am steadfastly on the side of the police in this matter but i am persuaded that perhaps the correct thing for me to do is to withdraw the amendment to enter into these discussions and come back at report stage i hope with something very satisfactory <e> <s> if not i will have to fall back on the other amendment of the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i would hope it would have a much easier ride than mine has had <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose this amendment for similar reasons <e> <s> i speak on behalf of the police organisations <e> <s> they certainly would oppose this further manacle on their activities <e> <s> my noble friend lord gifford has said that this would prevent the police from doing much of what they have done in relation to flying pickets <e> <s> the police job is hard enough without us erecting further barriers <e> <s> therefore i shall vote against this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i have discussed this with various police organisations and they would very much welcome not having to do the search and that it should be done by a medical practitioner midwife or nurse <e> <s> what would horrify them would be if there were no powers for intimate body searches because then body orifices would become much more common hiding places <e> <s> the police are certain that this amendment is essential in combating ingenious and inventive criminals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with the noble lords reply <e> <s> the hour is late but i should like to try to deal with the points that the noble lord has made <e> <s> the police federation looks after its members <e> <s> it has fought over many years to have a completely independent complaints tribunal <e> <s> what the government have done in this bill is to go halfway <e> <s> they have not met the federations point of view <e> <s> the police complaints authority will not be completely independent in dealing with all complaints <e> <s> the police federation would have liked the police complaints authority to deal with all complaints and to take them out of the hands of chief constables <e> <s> but the government have denied that opportunity to the police federation <e> <s> the government said in another place that they would give to them the opportunity to be legally represented if the charge might result in reduction of pay or even dismissal <e> <s> the cost of legal representation was not raised in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose this amendment <e> <s> at committee stage we had a long discussion on this amendment if not to clause to another clause where noble lords wished to have a circuit judge rather than a justice of the peace giving a clearance <e> <s> it was decided in this chamber to leave it to the justice of the peace <e> <s> now at this late stage the matter has been brought back again <e> <s> i believe it would be quite wrong for us to agree to this amendment <e> <s> the police organisations feel that it would be difficult because it means that the police bill would say either/or <e> <s> it is always bad law if it is not made absolutely clear <e> <s> what does a constable do if he is told that he must go either to a circuit judge or if one is not readily available as he might not be on saturdays and sundays to a justice of the peace <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the observations of my noble friend lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> we agreed at the committee stage that the custody officer will be a very important person <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon asked the noble lord lord elton if the home office would issue instructions that the custody officer should be of the rank of sergeant and that he should be independent <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton agreed <e> <s> independence is extremely important <e> <s> if we were to suggest that a police constable should have that kind of independence it would place a very considerable strain upon him <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that apart from some minor difficulties that have been mentioned we have the best postal system in the world and that at this time of the year the house would want to place on record its thanks to postal workers <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that trade unions will conduct these ballots in relation to affiliations or whatever it may be in a fair and honest way and that their own members are the best monitors of the system <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers reply to the question of the noble baroness lady seear is he saying that it is contemplated that there will be some well understood basis for settling pay in the public service coming from the discussions which are now taking place <e> <s> morale in the public sector is very low and unless there is agreement on some acceptable basis of settling pay conditions will deteriorate to the detriment of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords many chairmen of football clubs have said that much of the hooliganism has been inspired by the national front and other groups <e> <s> have the government anything to say about those allegations and if so what are they going to do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us whether there have been discussions with the civil service trade unions and what co-operation they are offering in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness lady serota for the way in which she chaired our committee and for her most lucid introductory statement to this debate <e> <s> the government issued a green paper on this subject as long ago as <e> <s> the chancellor of the exchequer in his first budget statement indicated his desire to modernise the tax system he wished to get away from the ideas and the social problems of earlier decades of this century <e> <s> last year in his budget he informed another place that a further and more definitive green paper would be issued shortly <e> <s> he underlined the fact that the tax districts would be fully computerised by early and so would be able to deal more easily with any future changes that he might have in mind <e> <s> the inland revenue press released the news at the same time that is on th march and indicated that the government favoured a system of fully transferable single persons allowances <e> <s> the government intended the forthcoming green paper <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what the noble lord the minister has said <e> <s> i understand that he will be reflecting on many of the points that have been put to him <e> <s> there is a good deal of feeling running through this amendment and the consequences of it <e> <s> quite clearly it will be wrong for me to press the amendment at this stage <e> <s> i want to read as carefully as possible what the noble lord the minister has said <e> <s> i think some of it is extremely important <e> <s> he said that the police require the powers mentioned in relation to the amendment which i have moved <e> <s> my amendment has been agreed with the police federation and so they <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i cannot be overjoyed at what he has said <e> <s> i still think my amendment is right but in view of the comments that have been made i shall not proceed with the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble minister for his explanation <e> <s> it appears that if i pursue this amendment to a vote i shall be mangled between my own front bench and the government forces <e> <s> therefore i shall not pursue the amendment at this stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am in some difficulty <e> <s> if the noble lord the minister wishes to refer to them i shall be perfectly happy <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend lord elwyn-jones i do not want to tread into a legal minefield <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has made it clear that there will be some difficulties here <e> <s> i will not therefore press the amendment <e>"]
