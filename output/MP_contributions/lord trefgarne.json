["<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> no one with any knowledge of the aerospace industry can doubt the importance of the proposals before us today <e> <s> british aerospace embodies a proud tradition the names of its distant predecessors de havilland vickers armstrong hawker supermarine avro bristol aeroplane and others must thrill any listener who like me has worked and lived with the sounds and smells of aeroplanes <e> <s> i list the names of some of the predecessor companies not merely to recall a past tradition but to make the important point that british aerospace is the british aircraft industry <e> <s> it represents the culmination of a process pursued by successive governments of different political persuasions to bring together in one organisation the main british aircraft manufacturing capabilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i did <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have to disappoint the noble lord which is sad so early in the report stage of the bill <e> <s> since the point has not been fully understood perhaps i may say just a few words <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i am rather disappointed that the noble lord lord airedale made that intervention because i was proposing to deal with this amendment and with amendment no <e> <s> in the same way <e> <s> but of course the noble lord is perfectly entitled to move his amendment and to say whatever he thinks <e> <s> i am now going to speak quite comprehensively on this amendment no <e> <s> and the noble lord may find himself satisfied when i sit down <e> <s> who can say <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will bear with me if i speak at a little length on this amendment <e> <s> in so doing i hope to set the fears of the noble lord lord airedale at rest so that when we come to amendment no <e> <s> he will not feel obliged to pursue the matter <e> <s> our objections to the principle of both <e>", "<cs> no my lords i think not <e> <s> the fact is that for a company to be in a position where they must stop the practice that practice has to be found to be both anti-competitive and against the public interest by the mmc <e> <s> if companies wish voluntarily to give undertakings before that stage is reached they are free to do so and the bill provides for that <e> <s> but it is not true to say that the director general can order the company to give up a practice because the company can insist and no doubt many will that their case should be taken before the mmc <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord and to the house <e> <s> the mmc is the monopolies and mergers commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord jacques is hoping for me to say something more and with the leave of the house i should like to do so <e> <s> i am not sure how i would describe the information that is to be published by the director general if it is not to be by guidance notes <e> <s> i fancy that that is just what it would be <e>", "<cs> my lords we have given considerable thought to this matter since it was raised by my noble friend in committee <e> <s> we accept and wish to encourage the co-operative principle in agriculture fisheries and forestry and would not wish action under the bill to undermine that encouragement <e> <s> we do not regard it as desirable for those courses of conduct pursued by agricultural cooperatives and their members which constitute and do no more than constitute the provision by co-operatives of services to their members and the carrying out by members of their commitments to trade with or through their co-operatives to be investigated under the bill <e> <s> we therefore intend to take the opportunity under clause to exempt these aspects of agricultural co-operatives from the definition of anti-competitive practices which may be investigated under the bill <e> <s> that would leave it open however for conduct of a kind which was genuinely anti-competitive and potentially undesirable which represented an abuse of a strong market position to be considered under the bill <e> <s> therefore i hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment in the light of that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to say yes i can give that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening yet again because this is a report stage <e> <s> the answer is that it will not be an amendment to the bill it will be an order made under the bill and i am afraid i cannot produce that for my noble friends inspection at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for speaking yet again <e> <s> i am speaking without a note but my recollection is that these orders are not subject to either negative or affirmative resolution procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords the point made in this amendment is i think very similar indeed to that being made in amendment no <e> <s> which follows and which the noble lord lord wallace of coslany and his friends are moving <e> <s> however i shall speak to this amendment and if i can say any more later i shall do so <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house if i misinterpreted the amendment i shall deal with it in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid not <e> <s> we did in all fairness go through this matter at considerable length at committee stage <e> <s> indeed there was a division on a similar amendment <e> <s> again may i say that i have sympathy with the underlying purpose but i think the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> it is already open to the director general to hear representations from people as to what he should investigate <e> <s> indeed one would imagine that complaints would form an important possibly the principal source of information prior to an investigation <e> <s> we think it is quite unnecessary to write anything further into the bill for this purpose <e> <s> i think that the fears of the <e>", "<cs> my lords what is there in the bill to prevent people or firms making representations to the dg <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of those very helpful opening remarks may i say that i am happy to repeat the assurance that i gave to my noble friend in a letter and which has been given by the director general namely that he would always give the firms concerned an opportunity to see the factual parts of his report before it was finalised and published <e> <s> i hope that in the light of that assurance my noble friend as he foreshadowed will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend said we discussed this matter previously but may i say that the onus is entirely on the firm to decide whether to offer an undertaking and it is important that the procedure should not be used as a means of prevarication or delay by firms <e> <s> even where both the director general and the firm may consider that a negotiation is likely to succeed if it is allowed say a further eight weeks or weeks beyond the eight weeks originally specified there can be no certainty that this will prove to be the case even where the firm is not deliberately trying to use the procedure as a means of delaying action <e> <s> we are most anxious that it should not be used as an excuse for delay and we regard weeks as the absolute limit if the procedure is not to lose credibility <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to seem inflexible in these matters <e> <s> i am speaking to amendment no <e> <s> although i recognise that my noble friend referred also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if my noble friend was speaking to amendment no <e> <s> only i might have been better able to accommodate him but as it is i am prepared to give an undertaking to consider this matter further and to consult him before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords since our debate in committee on a very similar amendment to this one we have looked at this matter again as i undertook <e> <s> but i have to tell the house that the amendment remains unacceptable <e> <s> the report of the council on tribunals on the <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said during the committee stage when we were considering as the noble baroness reminded us a similar amendment to this the government would of course consider very carefully any representations from consumer bodies about a nationalised industrys or other public bodys costs and efficiency standard of service or possible abuse of a monopoly situation <e> <s> such representations are most likely to raise questions which are probably already covered by the three sub-paragraphs in clause or by the earlier provisions of the bill and in the circumstances i hope the noble baroness will not wish to press her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords several noble lords and noble baronesses have said that they feel strongly on this amendment <e> <s> i do too <e> <s> the agricultural marketing boards have been included in clause because of their monopoly position under statute in which respect they are little different from many of the other bodies covered by subsection <e> <s> nevertheless in view of the special position of the ministers for agriculture in relation to agricultural marketing boards under the agricultural marketing act the government have tabled amendments to clause which we shall be able to discuss later <e> <s> these will have the effect of requiring the secretary of state formally to consult the relevant agricultural minister before a board is referred to the commission under clause <e> <s> the amendments also require similar consultation about the use of the secretary of states power of veto under the earlier clauses of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has said some of these boards have been in being for a good number of years and by and large they have not been subjected to the sort of scrutiny which we are now providing for where the ministers concerned feel that the investigation is appropriate <e> <s> i would turn the question about the noble lord asked me whether we have any positive evidence that these boards are in need of audit <e> <s> no i have not <e> <s> neither has the noble lord any evidence that they are perfect <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be much in sympathy with the noble lords intention to simplify the wording in clause but i am sorry to say that i am advised that the amendment is defective because as it stands it refers to a direction made under subsection <e> <s> but subsection is concerned only with a variation or revocation of a direction subsection makes clear that a direction in subsection has an identity separate from both a variation and a revocation and i hope therefore that the noble lord will not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to repeat to make it absolutely clear that it has been the monopolies and mergers commission practice under the fair trading act to check the accuracy of the factual material which may be used in their reports with the persons concerned <e> <s> this is a long-established practice which works well even though it is not written into the fair trading act <e> <s> we have not received representations that this practice has given rise to any problems in the past <e> <s> i can assure the house once more that the factual material in reports under this bill will be checked with the firms concerned both by the monopolies and mergers commission and by the director general <e> <s> reports into prices under clause do raise rather different issues since they could he extremely general but i am sure that the director general will do whatever seems necessary to check the factual accuracy of reports under clause <e> <s> i hope this meets the point my noble friend has put and that these assurances will enable him to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure your lordships are again grateful to the noble lord lord airedale for his attempts to ensure the maximum clarity in our legislation but i am afraid i am advised that what he seeks with this amendment is already provided by <e>", "<cs> that is so my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the conclusions of the hamburg scientific forum of the csce take the form of a short general report with annexes on the technical subjects dealt with at the forum <e> <s> the report includes <e>", "<cs> my lords there were indeed a number of useful technical conclusions made at the forum which as i have said were annexed to the report <e> <s> as for future meetings which the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be for my noble friend lord brockway to explain <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords and the delegates at the conference used this opportunity to make their views on these matters known to their soviet counterparts <e>", "<cs> my lords it is too early to say whether there will be any concrete results of the kind to which the noble lord refers but as i have said the delegates to that conference who were british scientists and not british government delegates lost no opportunity to impress their views upon the soviet delegates some of whom were scientists <e>", "<cs> my lords we will certainly support any proposal of that nature which in our view is effective and worthwhile <e> <s> as for the conclusions of the forum generally there were nationalities represented at that forum and a considerable degree of compromise was necessary to achieve the result that was achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> that is certainly our view <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments of the united states and the netherlands have publicly supported a boycott of the olympic games in moscow while a number of other nato countries including the federal republic of germany norway and luxembourg have expressed reservations about their athletes taking part <e> <s> as regards sporting bodies in the united kingdom an increasing number of them seem to be having doubts about the wisdom of going to moscow <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i certainly recognise the patriotism of mr watts <e> <s> as for the corporate view if that is the right expression of the various sporting bodies they really have not come to a corporate view yet <e> <s> we very much welcome the decision of the british olympic association to defer responding to the invitation from the moscow organising committee until a later date that is consistent with the attitude being adopted by other western national olympic committees and indeed with the advice given to the association by the government <e> <s> as for the financial implications of my noble friends supplementary questions i cannot give any assurances of particular financial support at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly the whole world is recognising the importance and merit of the proposals advanced by my noble friend but that does not detract from our view that to go to moscow in the present circumstances would be wholly unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not true <e> <s> we are certainly concerned with actions and it is actions that we are trying to achieve in this matter not mere words <e> <s> as for the cost of games this year or next i am not in a position to answer that question without notice <e>", "<cs> that is a very pertinent question my lords <e>", "<cs> indeed not my lords <e> <s> the question on the order paper of course relates to the olympic games <e> <s> our attitude is closely in line with that of the united states we strongly advise our athletes and indeed our spectators not to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the position is just as my noble friend describes <e> <s> as i understand it the decision of the british olympic association was to postpone replying to their invitation <e> <s> we very much hope that the boa will in the end accept the governments further advice not to go to moscow and will refuse the invitation <e>", "<cs> my lords a russian withdrawal from afghanistan if it were to take place following acceptance of my noble friends proposals or any other would clearly significantly alter the position but as the noble lord has said that would not necessarily of itself mean that we would withdraw our objections to the olympic games in moscow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> it precisely confirms our view <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there is a contradiction at all <e> <s> certainly the russian way of behaving including the ways referred to by the noble lord lord avebury were with us long before afghanistan but i think the noble lord underestimates the enormity of what the soviets have done in afghanistan <e> <s> they have invaded a neighbouring unaligned and sovereign nation <e>", "<cs> my lords if the russians withdraw from afghanistan that will of course fundamentally change the situation but i would not want in advance to have to say that if they did that without any reference to whatever else they might do between now and then we would automatically lift our objection <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord for a slip of memory <e> <s> yes indeed we do give the same advice to the media and to spectators <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have just said we hope spectators and visitors will take note of our advice not to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i readily acknowledge the passionate views of my noble friend in this matter and i understand what motivates thembut the fact is none the less that if the games are to continue in moscow as planned it will be a propaganda coup and triumph of monumental proportions for the russians <e>", "<cs> my lords may i apologise briefly for the length and complexity of this answer but it is an important matter so i hope your lordships will bear with me <e> <s> avgas l differs from four-star motor fuel by virtue <e>", "<cs> my lords we do recognise that there is a world problem certainly a european problem and an acute problem indeed in some parts of the world regarding this particular product <e> <s> the oil companies are urgently considering whether they can adjust the manufacture of motor spirit in such a way that it could be used safely in small aircraft engines <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord the answer on the octane numbers <e> <s> four-star motor spirit has an octane rating of not less than research octane number whereas l avgas has a rating of not less than octane performance octane number weak mixture and not less than performance octane number rich mixture <e> <s> i am afraid i have not got the vapour figures in front of me <e>", "<cs> my lords i do apologise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords while there is a significant difference between the prices of gasoline here and in the united states those are not the only causes for the difference in the costs of learning to fly <e> <s> a commercial pilot achieving his licence in this country is required to undertake i believe at least twice the number of flying hours of his american counterpart <e>", "<cs> my lords officials of diplomatic missions in london together with their families are entitled to full or restricted diplomatic privileges and immunities <e> <s> a further are entitled to some privileges and immunities under the international organisations act mostly for official acts only <e>", "<cs> my lords the particular case to which my noble friend refers and i am obliged to her for giving me notice of her intention to raise it was an unhappy one indeed <e> <s> but i should tell the house and my noble friend that the prosecuting authorities decided that the evidence could not support a charge of causing death by reckless driving and at the inquest the coroner brought in an open verdict <e> <s> the police are still <e>", "<cs> last october my lords <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> the privileges which we accord to diplomats in london are in line with those accorded to our own diplomats in almost every country in the world <e> <s> they stem from the vienna convention on diplomatic relations of which was given effect in united kingdom law by the diplomatic privileges act <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be true to say that there is widespread abuse of these arrangements <e> <s> there are a few well publicised abuses which we do our best to deal with <e> <s> however we could not unilaterally restrict the privileges of visiting diplomats without risking the genuine and very necessary privileges accorded to our diplomats overseas <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can readily deal with that matter <e> <s> the compensation is not affected by diplomatic immunity <e> <s> diplomats like everyone else are required to have proper insurance arrangements and that is certainly the case with regard to the recent finnish incident <e>", "<cs> no my lordsi am afraid that i would not agree with that <e> <s> there are good reasons why that should be the case and that is why it is provided for in the agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that that is the case but perhaps i can look into it if the noble baroness will draw my attention to a specific incident <e> <s> i can only repeat that if that were so it would arise from the agreements which we have entered into <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity to debate these two reports and once again your lordships are in debt to the select committee on the european communities under the chairmanship of the noble baroness for undertaking this study <e> <s> the committee has produced a number of notable reports in the past <e> <s> the government will want to take account of views expressed in this debate and of any conclusions that the select committee may reach on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot hide from your lordships our regret that so far that seems to be the case <e> <s> however we have high hopes that the french will comply with the forthcoming judgments when and if we get them as i believe we shall and perhaps then this unhappy matter can be brought to a close <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a small detachment of tanzanian troops in the seychelles and a substantial tanzanian force in uganda <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the seychelles government do admire the tanzanian government <e>", "<cs> my lords the tanzanian troops in uganda are there by virtue of an agreement between the two governments <e>", "<cs> my lords the troops in the seychelles which are just a few hundred in number arrived in two parties <e> <s> the first party i think was in june last year and the second party was in october <e>", "<cs> my lords the responsibility for the costs of the tanzanian troops of course lies with the tanzanian government <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene think it is the case is it not <e> <s> that the cdc has access to many funds other than just government funds <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords it falls to me to thank the noble earl lord listowel for raising this matter this afternoon and of course to congratulate the noble lord lord chorley on his most enlightened and absorbing maiden speech which clearly as several noble lords have already said came from the depth of his own experience <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two important points here <e> <s> first our ability to receive goods from developing countries or anywhere else on a substantial scale depends of course upon the health of our own economy and that we are working to rectify <e> <s> the other important matter to which i have briefly referred is our resistance to clamouring calls for protection by british industries <e> <s> there are many applications to the government particularly through the european community machinery for protection from what are called imports from low-cost suppliers and these we have been able to resist to a very substantial extent <e> <s> i hope that that is helpful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it really does not matter what we call itwe still have to find the money and that is the difficulty <e> <s> the aid programme which we inherited from our predecessors could not be sustained with the funds available to the government <e> <s> that was why we had to revise them <e> <s> my noble friend lord holderness delivered as he always does an illuminating and thought-provoking speech founded on his great experience and eminence in these matters <e> <s> it might be presumptive of me as well as time-consuming if i discussed in too much detail what my noble friend said but i shall certainly undertake to study it very carefully indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have that information <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are not talking of like with like <e> <s> was referring to the raw figures if i may call them that of our aid programme which in the year i referred to was million net from the united kingdom that is to say the gross figure less the receipts from loan repayments and interest <e> <s> i compared that with a similar figure for the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no evidence to indicate that the operation of so-called cowboy aircraft is a widespread problem in the united kingdom <e> <s> the question derives i believe from the occasion at bristol airport on th october when a boeing struck a hedge and a number of approach lights as it took off <e> <s> the aircraft continued its flight to kuwait without further incident <e> <s> it arrived in the united kingdom on th august american-owned and registered and during its stay in this country was leased to a liechtenstein based company and reregistered under a zaire registration although there is some doubt as to the latter <e> <s> i am assured by the civil aviation authority which has the matter under investigation that it is an isolated incident and that it is not aware of any other such incident so far as the united kingdom is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot of course answer for the policing of the regulations by other states <e> <s> but i can say that we have no evidence to support the suggestion that this is a widespread hazard <e>", "<cs> my lords according to the latest available information countries have granted permanent residence to or more refugees from south east asia since <e> <s> a further countries have accepted smaller numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see from the list in front of me any country except the peoples republic of china which has accepted far more than any other country which has a communist rgime <e> <s> i might want to consider that more carefully but i cannot see any from the list <e> <s> as for the position of hong kong it is certainly true that they have played a quite remarkable role in this matter <e> <s> the latest figures i have are <e>", "<cs> my lords that intervention is as always most helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the particular matter which my noble friend raises <e> <s> perhaps i can look into it and get in touch with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i would want to consider the implications of that supplementary <e>", "<cs> no my lords the noble earl has misunderstood what i said <e> <s> there are or so refugees in hong kong presently who are slowly but surely being found permament places around the world but the fact as i mentioned earlier that hong kong has accepted nearly refugees for permanent settlement is very satisfactory indeed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is supposed to be making an intervention <e> <s> if he wants to make a speech perhaps he should wait his turn <e>"]
